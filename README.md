This repository is used to document my training materials.

The notebook is best viewed with Python Markdown nbextension enabled.
Notebook can also be viewed as slides if RISE nbextension is enabled.

There is also an HTML version of the notebook in the respective lesson's directory. However, code written using the Python Marrkdown nbextension will not show properly.
