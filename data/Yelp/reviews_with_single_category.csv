Restaurants,"Are you are really looking at the review for LJS?  Its fried stuff, with extra fried stuff in a cardboard boat.  You will regret eating it 30 minutes after you finish, but it is delicious.",3
Restaurants,"I agree with Paul on this one. But I had to stop here on my way home from work tonight. 
(I think I feel my heart yelling at me again) , The gal at the drive thru window was just soooo sweet , I just might go back and ask her to marry me! 
But then again , she gave me a slip with a survey on it to fill out online. 
Maybe she just wanted my positive response. Ok Sarah B. you got it ... now where's my free coke ?",3
Restaurants,"It's deep fried garbage....it's LOS c'mon what do you expect.....however I have never had better, friendlier service at a fast food restaurant.",5
Restaurants,"I love LJS and have to agree, service was decent here. I tried a piece of my kid's chicken (I only ever get the fish for myself) and was pleasantly surprised to find white breast meat (same chicken texture as chick fil a). A little grimy dining room, and the bathroom handle is broken 8/2015... It would be nice if they made it an A&W-LJS but as-is still works for me.",4
Restaurants,"I love LJS, but I  had to write a review regarding this particular location.  The inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for.  It smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door.  It took about 15 mins for the food, so I figured it was gonna be all fresh...negative!  The fish was old and cold and fries were a very soft.  The corn lacked butter.

I didn't care for the onion rings and my boyfriend said the Coleslaw tasted spoiled.

The chicken planks and hushpuppies were the only things edible.  

Service wasn't too bad - nice people.  Too bad a whole bunch of flies started flying around the dining area and prep area, which ruined my appetite.",2
Restaurants,"This is a pretty decent Arby's, and given the condition of the other fast food restaurants on this stretch of Ohio River, it practically reaches exceptional.  The dining room is clean and nicely modern.  The service is friendly.  I don't think I've ever had a bad experience.",4
Restaurants,Everytime I eat at this location I end up with a sick stomach.  I don't have that problem at other Arby's.  The dining area is clean and everything else seems ok but I always get a sick stomach.  Maybe they should relook at their food prep.,2
Restaurants,"Arby's is definitely king of the fast food joints on the Blvd.  For that, I'd give it five stars.  However, it's still fast food, which explains the mediocre rating.  Do not go here without a coupon from the Sunday paper--there's a whole page of them at least once a month.  The staff here is very nice and very fast, and on the whole, the food is better than elsewhere by the river if you're stuck with a fast food choice.",3
Restaurants,"My beef was so raw that I had to put it in the microwave for two minutes. It was even slightly cold before I reheated it. The manager says they cook it medium rare, and I explained it was so rare it ate the lettuce off of the sandwich! 

Neither the brown sugar bacon and beef nor the BLT had much bacon. (How do I post pictures?) For a sandwich advertised to have delicious bacon, this fell WAY short. The little bit of bacon it did have was burnt. Really Arby's? I told the manager I have no idea how they thought sending out a sandwich like that was acceptable.

Overall, this made a horrible day worse. I was celebrating my two oldest girls' graduation from high school, and what was supposed to be a very nice dinner was a disaster. We went to Arby's as a back up so I had at least a little something to eat. That was equally disastrous. At least the fries were okay, albeit a little soft and mushy for some reason. 

Based on this experience, I would not go back. Based on this experience, I would most definitely not recommend this to others.",2
Restaurants,"Great pizza, and the calzones are huge. Relaxed atmosphere; try the jukebox if you want to hear an old hit. Once, they forgot a topping on our order. They not only fixed the mistake, but they threw in a two liter just for our trouble. Also great for takeout or grabbing a slice at lunch time.",4
Restaurants,"We were wanting to order take-out one night and looked through our folder of coupons to pick a place. After being ""pizza'd out,"" we decided to try Miaetta's due to their $20 deal (wings, hoagie, fries and a soda). 

The food was good. Nothing spectacular. The wings were sort of dainty, though I feel they compensated by giving us more than a dozen. The garlic parm sauce was also very light. They could have been a bit more generous. We ordered the Miaetta hoagie which was pretty much like a club. Once again, good but nothing to write home about. I could have made the same sandwich myself. Fries were standard. One thing to add - I found it strange that they only had four sodas to choose from: Pepsi, Mt. Dew, a generic juice and something else. 

Considering this place is extremely close to us, I would stop back to try other things on the menu. According to the other reviews on Yelp, their gourmet Italian food is what they're known for. Now we know what to order next time. My boyfriend said the scene on the inside was very old fashioned and homey, so I'd love to check them out again but perhaps dining in rather than take-out. I love nothing more than a good 'ole mom and pops kitchen!",3
Restaurants,Maietta catered our party and they provided wonderfully delicious food at a great price.  The food was delivered promptly and it was an amazing treat.  I would use them again in a heartbeat.,4
Restaurants,"if i wanted to blow up a spot, this pizza place is in very limited company with Sam's Sun Sandwiches also on Brownsville road.  Extremely tasty pizza dough, the sauce is flavorful and portioned perfectly, the cheese is browned and balanced just like it oughtta be.  I have not had other menu items, so consider this review by the pizza only.  Great prices also,  Be sure and eat your pizza fresh, don't call in the order for delivery, or pick it up late.  Got to eat it fresh on the spot to really appreciate how good this is",5
Restaurants,"Believe it or not, I was planning on doing a review of this Pittsburgh landmark before the big news that Warren Buffett's billions was buying Heinz. 

Dear Warren Buffett, don't mess with my ketchup!

FACT: Heinz Ketchup is used in 93% of restaurants, nation wide!

The HJ Heinz company was formed in 1869 when Henry John Heinz sold his mother's canned horseradish door to door. 

Today Heinz's headquarters are still here in Pittsburgh, although no products are made in Pittsburgh anymore. The plant at the base of Troy Hill near the Allegheny river was sold to Treehouse Foods where they make private label soups. I'll never forget going to the factory as a Cub Scout and how the vinegar smelled as we toured the factory. We each got a full size bottle of Ketchup to take home with us, and of course a Pickle Pin, one of the most iconic symbols associated with Heinz.

Again, Mr Buffett, don't mess with the red stuff or a whole gaggle of Terrible Towel waving Yinzers will open a can of whoop ass on ya!",5
Restaurants,Heinz ketchup and pickles are terrific.  It isn't worth trying to save a nickel with watery condiments.,5
Restaurants,"Heinz products are a staple of the US pantry - even though the famous tomato ketchup is loaded with corn syrup - kids love it all the same.  Heinz ""57"" sauce, Salad cream (UK), Mayo and beans are all good too.",4
Restaurants,"I feel like all Sarku's taste the same, chicken is good and overall everything is pretty unsalty. However, one of my broccoli's had black stuff on it, and I'm pretty sure it was dirty, not charred.

Hm... well it WAS $5.65 after tax for a huge plate.",3
Restaurants,"sick...and not in the way my college roommate use to say ""that's sick! "" (meaning cool, awesome, sweet, wicked (variation of any of the previous). No this was just gross. 

After driving across town to two different malls to find a particular dress in my size, I worked up quite the appetite. Hey it's Friday- I'll go for some Americanized Asian...so I ordered the general Tso's with a maki roll ( not sushi- this is what they call their spring rolls), and noodles.

My noodles were cold...like really cold. The portion was beyond stingy- normally with these kind of take-out restaurants I cannot finish my meal, but their were exactly 11 pieces of chicken 7 of which were teeny-tiny bits... The texture of both meat and noodles was very mushy and overall not so tasty. When I paid with debit the girl at the counter literally handed my receipt and said ""sign-this"" ...so much for service. I will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible. 

I should have known better than to give into mall food cravings...not worth the calories. But hey on a positive note I did find my dress size at CP Mall!",1
Restaurants,"I don't understand the super low reviews on here, eat here quite often, it's delicious, and fresh, they cook to order.  For mall Asian-style food, you can't beat it!",4
Restaurants,"I too don't understand the low ratings for this place. As others have said you've got to keep your expectations in perspective when visiting a mall food court. For a quick and tasty fast food experience I really love Sarku Japan. They do cook the food fresh to order and I usually order their Teriyaki chicken special. Their teriyaki isn't too sweet which I like and it carmelizes on the chicken for a really great flavor. Because I'm a big guy who likes to eat I get the double meat, spring roll and drink combo. All this for just over $10. In my book and palate I think this is a pretty good deal.",4
Restaurants,"Not bad for a quick lunch....the teriyaki chicken meal is something you can't beat.  It's fresh and somewhat healthy.  The vegetables are my favorite.  And I definitely recommend fried rice over white rice.  They give you a lot of food,  could have shared it with my husband because we both did not finish.  So definitely worth the money!",3
Restaurants,"IHOP is IHOP... it's great for it's consistency wherever you go.  Usually when I hit up IHOP it's on the weekends and you end up fighting the crowds, but if you time it just right... your IHOP experience can be a good one.

This experience recently on a Saturday happened to be after a 4 mile run so we were super super hungry.  I was pleasantly surprised since they offer some new healthy options.  I had the wheat french toast combo with turkey bacon and scrambled egg beater eggs.  Not too bad for 490 calories.  Good way to start the day.",3
Restaurants,"iHop is one of our favorite restaurants for late night suppers. We prefer not to go when the rest of the area eats. Our experiences there have been mixed. Servers that I can recommend are Spring & Tiffany who will go the extra distance to make sure you have plenty to drink & refresh your hot maple syrup.

Unfortunately we have also had servers who think that making you wait 1/2 hour or more for your check is the way to win a big tip. In that instance the server never returned & we had the meal comped by the manager who told us that she had gone across the street for baby formula. As we were leaving she was pulling up. Another server told me that the reason we had to wait so long to leave was because she had to go to the bathroom. On one of our most recent visits our server told us that the reason that our food was cold, that we got no drink refills, that he couldn't give us our check in a timely manner was because he was "" running around like a chicken with his head cut off.""

My wife had ordered cheese soup & a sandwich when we had the chicken as a waiter. The soup came out cold & it resembled snot. The manager took it off our bill.

On our last visit the manager served us herself & it was a great meal with excellent service. I like iHop because its cheap & you get decent sized portions. I love the all you can eat pancakes even though I can never eat more than a single plate. 

If you're worried about shenanigans dining there late at night don't worry. Pineville stations an officer there from 12am - 5am.",3
Restaurants,"My son and I love going to IHOP for breakfast. Well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations. The restaurant had about 10 tables empty and we still had to wait 20 mins to be seated. My guess is they were understaffed. 

Once we did get seated, service was slow and really bad. I had to ask 4 times for silverware, 3 times for a straw for my sons cup, and the food just wasn't that good. My plate was dirty. My son asked for strawberries on his pancakes and they had blueberry syrup on them - I wonder who's plate they scraped them off of. 

Oh and the straw came as we were paying. Not our best IHOP experience.",2
Restaurants,"My wife and I had great service from Spring when we ate here a few nights ago. We always ask for either her or Tiffany. Unfortunately the steak tips and eggs that I ordered for dinner were foul. The steak was either overcooked or it was bordering on raw. Thank Gods for the fluffy buttermilk pancakes & hot maple syrup. Without them I'd have gone hungry that night.

You might wonder why we continue to eat there given the plethora or marginal experiences, well it is very cheap & its closer to the house than driving down to Carrowinds to go to Cracker Barrel.",2
Restaurants,We went to iHOP this evening. Spring was out so we got served by Bob the manager. We both had sweet tea and ham & egg melts with fries. Everything was good. Bob is a good waitress. He was prompt with our drink refills.,3
Restaurants,We were greeted by Tracy the manager who decided to serve us along with our faithful waitress Sky. We sat in our usual booth & had a couple sweet teas. My wife had wings and a salad. I had a burger without the bacon interwoven into it. Overall it was a good meal with a lot of iHop gossip being passed along.,4
Restaurants,Spring seated us in the back section tonight.  We both settled for sweet tea. My wife ordered biscuits and gravy. I ordered a spinach and mushroom omelet with a side of buttermilk pancakes and sausage. I ate all the pancakes and most of the omelet. I think I should just stick to pancakes. Tonight we met the crazy crack lady. She appeared at our booth to inform us that her Lincoln had a leaky fuel line & what were we going to do about it? Since all the garages were closed for the evening I suggested that she talk with Tracey the manager. Tracey handed her off to someone else & she slowly started to make the rounds of the customers in the restaurant. Tracey let us out a side door in the kitchen to get away from her. LOL.,4
Restaurants,My wife & I were back at iHop in Pineville this evening. The restaurant was pretty empty. The manager told us that it was very full a couple hours ago because Tuesday night is kids eat free night. My wife had chicken & waffles & I had a new menu item the chicken fajita quesadilla with a side of onion rings. My wife inhaled her meal. I worked my way through mine. Ihop makes really good onion rings so it was a treat to eat there tonight.,3
Restaurants,Tonight we're seated close to the kitchen. There's a bunch of adult children seated around us. Bob is the manager tonight and Spring is our server. Matt is also serving tonight. He's as dour as he normally is. I ordered a sweet tea while my wife ordered a pepsi. I'm using a birthday coupon for a free entree for chocolate chip pancakes. Spring brought me an ice cream sundae on the house! She said they would sing happy birthday to me but I told them not to bother. The food was good. We had a good time.,3
Restaurants,It's fairly crowded tonight. I keep asking myself why on earth I would want to eat here on my birthday. The only reason I could think of was that the servers are really entertaining. Its a good place to people watch and that night there were certainly a lot of different people to observe. Spring was our server tonight. I had pancakes with hot maple syrup & a sweet tea. I guess iHop pancakes are one of my comfort foods. I've never had a bad pancake at iHop.,3
Restaurants,Josh is awesome!! Great server. Get the ayce pancakes. Yum!,5
Restaurants,"Spring is our waitress. We went down so that my wife could get her free birthday entree. She had all you can eat pancakes. I had a short stack of pancakes with sausage, bacon, eggs & grits. The food was filling but average. 

Spring & Matt were the only servers. Bob was manager that night. Ihop is still good comfort food.",4
Restaurants,"Matt is our server tonight. I ordered a Bacon cheeseburger and a sweet tea with onion rings as the side. My wire ordered some breakfast thing. There are five people in here including us. We'd hoped for more dinner theater, alas.",3
Restaurants,Even though the place is almost empty there are still enough people to watch. I'm going to order the all you can eat pancakes. My wife ordered wings and a house salad. Apparently 7pm is the dinner hour for older Charlotteans. The front of the restaurant was almost full. Service was slow but there were only two servers Matt & Tiffany. Tracey was the night manager. We go there to hang out & kill a few hours so slow service doesn't matter really to us anymore. The thing I really hate is the way that the food is presented. It looks nothing like it does on the menu.,3
Restaurants,"The place is hopping tonight. Matt, Bina, Tiffany and Tracey are working tonight. Apparently Scarowinds is providing lots of late night traffic. There are a lot of teens here tonight and the ever watchful Pineville police officer. I ordered the ultimate Bacon something or other with pumpkin pancakes and a sweet tea. I hope its filling. I'm pretty hungry tonight. As it turned out I ate it all & it was really good. It didn't look anything like the menu though they really need to work on presentation.",3
Restaurants,It's an absolute nightmare of people tonight. I had the jack cheddar potatoes with pumpkin pancakes and extra meat. Matt was my server. He forgot the larger plate for the pancakes. Tracey dyed her hair jet black! All in all good dinner theater and average food. When I was on my way out the door I encountered a group of teens involved with saving some girl's soul from the devil. Definitely an odd night.,3
Restaurants,"The service was very friendly, but the food wasn't all that good. Most everything tasted like it had been sitting around for quite a while before being plated. Especially the potatoes. Not sure I would return.",2
Restaurants,"My wife asked me if I wanted to go to iHop tonight and naturally I said yes. I have to protect my dukedom. I ordered the country sausage potatoes, pumpkin pancakes & grits. It will probably be good. Their grill guy is pretty consistent in turning out good food. There are quite a few people here for a Saturday night. Well the food was barely warm. Not an auspicious start to the meal. Cold grits aren't a treat. All in all I wondered why we bothered going.

We went to iHop for brunch today 11/5/12 around noon & had Katrina as our server. It wasn't the best meal as far as service was concerned. I had to call her back to the table to refill my drink. Apparently my empty glass wasn't enough of a visual cue. The meal itself was average, a bacon cheeseburger with fries and sweet tea. I don't think of iHop as a lunchtime destination and I probably never will.",2
Restaurants,I'm trying the chicken tortilla soup and the French onion pot roast. I can safely say that I will never order either again. The soup was steaming hot and its primary flavor was salt. The pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever. It was tender but the mushrooms and carmelized onions were not in evidence. To make matters worse the corn was flavorless and the mashed potatoes had no butter. Tiffany failed as our server tonight but Tracey stepped up and refreshed our drinks and brought me melted butter and grilled onions.,2
Restaurants,"For an IHOP, the Pineville location is as good as it gets!

What do I mean ""for an IHOP""?  It's a fast food franchise, whose claim to fame are their fast, and (fairly) inexpensive, breakfasts.  Frame your expectations accordingly, and you won't be disappointed.

We're especially fond of the night crew: (Spring, Tracy, and Tiffany); each are not only friendly and efficient, but they're funny as hell.

For as much as I might enter this location with a frown, I walk out with a smile each time, and it isn't the pancakes. It isn't that they're bad...it's just that they're standard IHOP fare.

The dining area is consistently clean; servers are great, the pancakes are pretty good, and fairly inexpensive.  This is a place for breakfast, but not much else.",4
Restaurants,"This place is empty tonight. Spring is the only server. Tiffany is here too but she looks terrible. I ordered the 3 eggs, 3 pancakes with 4 sausage links. Hopefully it will be good. And... It was just fine. Not the best by any means but good food.",3
Restaurants,"Okay, I know this is just an IHOP, so I shouldn't expect culinary excellence.  

But.

We've been to this location a couple times.  They do breakfast VERY well.  Their coffee is always fresh and hot.  Their pancakes are always fresh and hot.  Their orange juice is never too tart, never too sweet.  I've never found foreign items in my food.  Wait staff is always courteous and helpful.

But.

Beware - when you order NON-breakfast items, you may not end up with a satisfying meal.  This past weekend I took my daughter and my grandmother to the IHOP for a quick & cheap post-church lunch.  My grandmother ordered coffee and a belgian waffle - she said it was very delicious.  My daughter got the baby cakes kids meal, and she ate most of it.  I made the mistake of ordering the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and corn on the side.  The chicken fried steak was so tough as to be inedible (I took a couple bites and left the rest).  The mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning.  I took one bite and when I realized I was eating aged potatoes, I left the rest.  The corn was the best thing on the plate.  Needless to say when we got home I made myself a sandwich since I didn't really get lunch at the IHOP. *lol*

As I said, we've been to this location before, and they definitely do breakfast right (which makes sense given what an IHOP is).  My daughter and grandmother were very satisfied with their meals.  But stick with the breakfast menu.  Don't venture anywhere near the non-breakfast menu.  Then you should be fine.",2
Restaurants,"Colorado omelette time! It looked interesting on the menu & I thought let's try it. So much of iHop's menu is bland & boring. The Colorado omelette is the meat lovers omelette according to Tiffany. It has bacon, sausage & regrettably pot roast.

Unlike the pot roast that is served as a stand alone meal the pot roast in the Colorado omelette is actually moist & tasteless. I found the entirety of it repulsive but managed to choke down about a third of it. I left the rest on the plate vowing to never try it again. As it happened it was taken off our bill. The pancakes are great as always.

Ihop gets three stars for the service & the servers not the nasty omelette.",3
Restaurants,"New menus at ihop means higher prices! Wonderful. It seems that everything on the menu has gone up by at least $1.00 across the board. I had a Country Omelet with a side of Red Velvet Pancakes. The omelet was uninspired. It had no flavor whatsoever. Thank God for ketchup! The red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them.  THey were brown on the outside & an odd shade of dark pink on the inside. They also were flavorless but they had some sickeningly sweet cream cheese flavored paste drizzled all over them. Then the stack was topped with whipped cream. Whipped cream? Really? Maybe that goes over well with children but for an adult its a little creepy. The accompanying dinner theater provided by other diners & the sweet tea were the highlights of the meal.

The other strange thing about iHop is that the food never comes out hot, only warm. I think the grills are just for show. I think that they warm everything in an Easy Bake oven under a 10watt bulb.",2
Restaurants,Cedric is our server. A nice polite young man. I ordered a breakfast sampler. The restaurant is absolutely packed this morning. The food was hot & delivered promptly. Cedric was a great server I'd be happy to have him serve us again.,4
Restaurants,(4/14/13) I ordered an appetizer sampler and my wife ordered chicken strips this evening. The presentation wasn't awesome nor was the food artfully arranged but it was hot & delicious!,3
Restaurants,I ordered the ultimate bacon and sausage platter with all you can eat pancakes. Spring is our server. The restaurant was pretty empty when we got there but slowly started to attract people as we ate. I suppose that most people don't see IHop as a Mother's Day destination which was good because it was very easy to get a table. The food would't win any awards but it hit the spot & the dinner show was always good.,3
Restaurants,(5/24/13) Spring is our server this evening.  I ordered a cheeseburger and a side of onion rings. It was good. My wife ordered chicken tenders. The food was good but average. We mainly go to iHop to people watch & hang out with the staff. All in all a good evening.,3
Restaurants,"(6/16/13) Its time to use my free birthday coupon. Argh, the menus have changed again. According to Spring the prices have gone up an average of 0.20 across the board. The new menus also are missing the side items for non breakfast foods. The pictures for each dish are closer to the ways that the dishes actually look rather than some corporate artist's fantasy.

I had an omelet with red velvet pancakes & sweet tea. It was good, comfort food that hit the spot better than Red Robin did.",4
Restaurants,"(6/29/2013) Both Spring and Tiffany are working tonight. The restaurant is sort of full for nearly 2300. I ordered a spinach & mushroom omelet, sausage links & buttermilk pancakes. My wife had the chicken fajita quesadillas & onion rings. Everything was great! The surprise at the end was special. Tiffany, Spring & Cindy gave me an ice cream sundae & sang happy birthday to me! All in all a very good evening.",4
Restaurants,(7/14/13) Spring is our server this evening. I had the all you can eat pancakes & my wife had chicken wings. Everything was good.,4
Restaurants,"As far as IHops go, 5 stars. Super friendly service, Kay was awesome. Carolyn at check out was great too. Got my free birthday meal and just substituted it for something of equal value. Delicious breakfast and really quick.",4
Restaurants,"(9-14-13) Had a new server Nikki this evening. Spring  & Tiffany left this location. Only Matt & Cindy remain from the old crew. The food was good. I had a cheese burger & onion rings with sweet tea.

(10-3-13) We once again dined at Ihop. I had a one year anniversary certificate from the online Ihop club. I got an omelet & pumpkin pancakes. Matt was our server & the food was great!",4
Restaurants,Go there every other Thursday for my life group bible study and they are excellent with their customer service and the food is great and they know what I want when I get there and keeps sweet tea on my table. They like us being there b/c of what we do and stand for.,5
Restaurants,I ordered the all you can eat pancakes and four sausage links. Coty is our server though Matt & Cindy are here too. Everything was fine. It definitely was better than Waffle House.,3
Restaurants,"It's IHOP. I'm still alive. 

Food is good. Large selection of food from breakfast (Crazy huge omelets!) to dinner. Sometimes hard to make a quick decision.",3
Restaurants,"So I'm having the bacon and white cheddar melt on artisan sourdough bread and it's amazing! The most amazing thing about it is that it has no distinct taste other than the eggs. The seasoned fries are seasoned with salt I believe. They taste good. The grilled sourdough bread has the strangest scent. It reminds me of freshly drying paint.
My wife ordered the new quesadillas. She's fully consumed one with no snide comments flying so it must be good.",3
Restaurants,"Michelle is our server this evening.  I ordered a mushroom spinach burger with fries and an unsweetened tea. Unsurprisingly nothing had any flavor. The service was pretty bad as well. A shame really,  I was looking forward to chatting with Matt, but he was sent home early because it was dead. When we left there were at least 30 people there.",3
Restaurants,Food was very salty. I think I'm bout to have a heart attack. God took too long to come out and half our order was forgotten. Anyhoo I was so hungry I ignored the salty food and scarfed it down. There seasonal fruit contained 3 canned pineapples and 2 canned grapes.,2
Restaurants,"Good clean restaurant - manager is hands on and aware of customers and kitchen staff. I sat near kitchen so it was loud - my order was steak and eggs with steak medium - came to me with well done steak - manager immediately fixed it - 
For lower than expected expectation the experience didn't disappoint - 
If your hungry for breakfast food it is a good place to go . 
The waitress was not much help and really apparently non existent . The check was left on my table way too early and so was she ... 
Don't go in with too high expectations and you'll do fine ...",4
Restaurants,"Terrible service and terrible food! I asked this girl twice for sausage gravy and the first time she came back with the wrong one, the second time she brought back chicken broth! Food was bland and tasteless and she never bothered to fill our drinks. Never coming back again, it was such a waste of money!",1
Restaurants,"We always go here when we are in the mood for breakfast! The food is great and great priced. I've worked in the service industry for years and trust me. These people work hard, they just deal with a lot of shit! A lot of people running them to death and not wanting to tip. And trust me we know right away when your gonna tip or not. You go out you tip! Period! Anyways our most recent visit we had An amazing server.. I believe her name was Kay. I'll correct it if that's wrong... But she's the older Asian lady and she is beautifully sweet! She did a great job and made us all very comfortable. The manager and the hostess also checked on us and we loved it! She got a 30$ tip for being a good server! People start tipping your servers! We heard that day someone tipped a young girl a dollar?! A dollar?!!!! Stay at home trash! Trust me it's better if we get stiffed! But don't go out and have these people work hard and then complain because you want something for free! Pay for what you eat!!!!!!! You don't deserve anything!!!!!",5
Restaurants,"I would not go back here, unless I wanted to take up waiting as a occupation.   It took 20 minutes for a waiter to come by and take our drink order and then another 15 minutes for a second waiter to come by and ask to take our food order who then promised to expedite the order due to the wait but blamed the kitchen for being slow.  At this point I was very frustrated but want to hang on for the kids.  

Once we finished ordering, my 5 year old needed to use the restroom and wanted an escort over.  I could not help but notice that several people who had been seated right before us and others who were waiting to be seated after us had already been served their food and were half done with their meals.  Slow kitchen right.

This did not improve my opinion of the restaurant nor did the drama at the table across from us. Apparently our waiter has messed up the order and served the wrong food to the table and was having to run additional food over.  Based on that squabble and another 15 minutes of waiting I decided to leave.  I could not face waiting longer and having the food order wrong and ""cold"" as the lady at the table across us was loudly declaring.

In summary the service is very questionable.  You either get lucky and get your food quickly or you get stuck in limbo with no recourse.  My seven year old did not like leaving but told me in the car that we should never go back to the Pineville IHOP again ""As they broke a promise to get our food.""  I couldn't agree more.",1
Restaurants,"Just love it here and especially when Kay is our server! She has to be one of my favorite servers of all time! She is so attentive and friendly  Definitely worth taking a trip and ask for Kay! She will take care of you, and always do it with a smile!",5
Restaurants,Came here lit af just wanted some pancakes. Open 24 hours from Friday to Sunday it's 1:37 am Friday explain this to me. Free gucci,2
Restaurants,Our waiter  is Nicole. At least  that's  what  his name tag  says. So far the drink order is right. Hopefully  the dishes  will be as tasty as I remember . The food that looked so good in the menu was a shadow of its photographic self. The food was tasty but it had no flavor. I suppose that's why there's such an array of sauces and ketchup on the table.,3
Restaurants,What can I say we were one of 4 families in there around 12 in the afternoon not busy at all and the service was slow it was unacceptable! Never did I wait at an I-hop for my food for almost 30 minutes I wanted to walk out I was so frustrated and when we got our food the portions well I don't know what's going on but they were small leaving u hungry after u just ate! I will stick with Waffle House!,2
Restaurants,"I've been going here for the last ten ish years and I've only had one decent experience here. I would not suggest this location but to drive a little extra to another location. The service is horrible, the severs are rude and the food is only mediocre. The place smells of old towels and the bathrooms are horrible. If I had a choice, I wouldn't go back",2
Restaurants,"(7/16/16) So we're  here for brunch. I'm   having a country omelet with a side  of  grits, unsweetened iced tea to drink. My wife is angry  that they no longer have sausage  gravy and that you have to ask for biscuits  as they are no longer  on  the  menu.

So the current  manager  has metallic  gold hair, whoa am I back in  the  70s? My country omelet was hearty and the grits were fine after a bit of sugar was added. My wife, on the other hand was not happy that her eggs had been cook over hard rather than over medium. She had them re-cooked then had words with the server about the rest of the plate going cold. She took it back to the kitchen to be re-heated. The other issue that my wife had was that she ordered toast and no pancakes and wound up getting served both.

I think that we'll wind up trying another iHop. As other diners have remarked the service has gone downhill at this one. What a shame.",3
Public Services & Government,"Festivals. Fun. Beer. Lots of beer. Charlotte Center City Partners (or Find Your Center) puts on a lot of these types of festivals Uptown and in South End. When you check out their website or their weekly newsletter you'll be able to see lots of events coming up like Beer, Blues and BBQ, Taste of Charlotte, Speedstreet and the like. 

Many of these events and festivals usually have beer available, hence why I'm a fan. And, yeah, I also really like supporting the local organization that's responsible for Uptown's development. If only there was a PBR festival...!",4
Public Services & Government,"For fun in Center City, Charlotte Center City Partners has it covered!

Yes, these are the folks largely responsible for the big ole event Uptown. Whether it's Beer, Blues & BBQ, Taste of Charlotte, Speedstreet or pumpkin carving for Halloween - I give these guys credit. Considering only 10-12K people live in Uptown, they have a large feat of bringing the masses into Center City. 

As a whole, these events are well organized, nicely promoted and generally a really good time. Stephen puts it well - every event won't be for everybody, but I appreciate that they try to bring Charlotte together (as we're a large group of transplants). In addition to the events, they also send out a really great calendar of what's going on in Uptown & South End every week. If you don't get it already, definitely check it out.",4
Restaurants,"Arthurs offers a decent variety of genres all in one stop.  Grilled items like cheesesteaks; burgers; patty melts, salads ranging from chef to grilled chicken to asian, and grinders/hoagies (grinders here are hot, hoagies are cold).  I believe they serve breakfast but, have never been there in the A.M. so, this review is lunch only.

Most everything is as three stars indicates here in Yelpville, A-OK.  Generally pretty quick, especially the salad line.  I've never had the chicken caesar that Barrie H. trashes in his 7/26/10 review but have had the grilled tuna caesar.  Thankfully I've never experienced what he did.  It's not great and don't think you're going to get a medium-rare hunk of tuna on there cause its always well done and dry but, again, always A-OK beyond that.

It's close to the office and at least good enough for a once every other month visit to change things up.",3
Restaurants,"As a frequent stop on our work ""lunch train"" (choo, choo), Arthurs is always my pick (over Showmar's, that is... because those are usually our only two options!).  If you're looking for a greasy, delicious, made-the-right-way reuben, Arthurs is your spot.  Crispy, buttery, bread with just the right amount of tangy sauerkraut, loaded with corned beef and balanced out with a dollop of thousand island.  Mmmmm.  It's also delish with turkey instead of the corned beef.

I have a few gumbo connoisseurs in the office, and they all agree that Arthurs has the best chicken gumbo in walking distance of the Atrium.  As my co-worker put it ""If you see that Arthurs has the chicken gumbo as their soup of the day, you can't not get it.  Your lunch plans are made.""  And it must be true, because I've tried to get it several times at around 1:30, and they are always out!

I agree with the barrie h's comment to steer clear of the caesar salad, it leaves much to be desired, but for a good, hot sandwich and some tasty fries, Arthurs is the jam.",4
Restaurants,"Down on the plaza level of the ""jukebox building"" in uptown, Arthurs is a grill and salad place serving lunch and breakfast to corporate types both in the building and connected thru the over street walkway system that connects many other buildings.  

While lunch is mainly grilled sandwiches and fries or some rather large salads (some better than others), I have to give this place some credit for a breakfast that is affordable and relatively quick.  Mainly egg sandwiches served on any number of breads and with any number of regular meats, you can't beat the prices here once you are within the ""uptown grid.""  Under $3 is a little insane, and so post-workout, I like my odds at Arthurs.

In the morning there is never a wait and the staff looks a little surprised someone stopped in before 8:30 a.m.  But regardless, the stock English muffins toasted perfectly with a little egg to order.  If you want a meat, they've got that too- usually already cooked but placed back on the grill for heating only (no comment here).  They also have a number of Seattle's Best coffees and fountain drinks for those looking to get a caffeine fix in a colder way.  

Nothing fancy, nothing unexpected.  Just a quick breakfast that leaves you with some change after a 5-spot.  Try that across the way or somewhere else along the over street walkways- hard, if not impossible to do.  For that, I'm glad to see them sticking around.",3
Restaurants,"Top notch lunch food served quickly, at reasonable prices and with a smile. Whether it is off the grill, a salad or a sandwich, these folks do it right. Most of the employees have been there for years and take pride in providing great service!",5
Restaurants,"i love the Fish Sandwich.

Stay away from the chicken (kinda wierd considering the name) but on a few occasions it seemed dry and also it seemed as if they used the same grease.

I love the fried Okra... ummmmmmmm!!!!!
Family owned, pretty wide selection on the menu.",4
Restaurants,I ordered onion rings and when I went to pick them up the owner noticed the onion rings were burnt. When I asked them to replace the burnt onion rings or give me a discount she opened the to go box and threw the onion rings on the floor and when I asked why she did that she said you didn't want it and she didn't offer to replace it. I will never go back. All I asked for was good service. None to be had here!,1
Restaurants,"I just spent $18.15 for lunch and an uninvited guest appeared walking across the table.  One of the most expensive vomits, ever.

Please do not waste your time, gas or money.

When I told the waitress/cashier she asked me where it was and since i could not locate the roach her reply was maybe someone brought it in with them. 

Really, not an apology or let me get the manager. 

I should have just tossed the money in the trash because that is where the food is presently.",1
Restaurants,"I just moved to the neighborhood, and I there is no fast food with in walking distance of the place i moved to, and I have no car, and one of my neighbors told me they had great food there, Well my family and I being very hungry one night, and not having a way to the grocery store until in the morning, we decided to go here, now I cant say much about there chicken, but we ordered a cheeseburger and large fry, and OMG, it was delicious!! We have been going back there and ordering from them ever since, and it is family ran, and you always see the same nice smiling faces!!",5
Restaurants,"Not a big fan of this place.
Pretty hard to screw up chicken but they did a pretty well so I don't think I'll ever go back not sure parking pretty below average",2
Restaurants,"I ordered the flounder dinner. Generous portions.My meal was delicious. It came with the fish, cole slaw, french fries, and hush puppies. The only thing working against them is the appearance of the establishment, it looks a bit tattered but the food makes up for it. Also this is not a sit down establishment like the one in SW Charlotte. Business is family run.",4
Restaurants,"Seems like your standard carryout Chinese place. We had the General Tso and a Sesame Chicken. For three lunch specials that included rice and egg roll, we paid less than $16. Like many Chinese joints, they accept cash only (always a challenge for me  to scrounge up that paper money stuff people used to use).
It was as good as any other standard Chinese carryout and based on where we live now, it may likely be our go-to for quick, cheap Chinese.

One downer, we didn't get any fortune cookies. That can't be a good fortune.",3
Restaurants,"This is our go to Chinese carryout. Mainly because it is close to us. The food is as good as most of the genre and they share the same quirks, cash only, the same menu, the same flavors, heavy on the MSG, as all other Chinese carryout places. The execute well, the food is always hot and they have never messed up my order.",3
Restaurants,I want to start off by saying that Chinese food should not have YELLOW Rice!!! They do have good lunch specials and again this Chinese food wasn't very good. Still searching for a good Chinese food place here in Charlotte. The only reason why I tried this place because I was next to it at the time. Still searching!,2
Restaurants,"This is not gourmet Chinese food. 

This is store-front-hole-in-the-wall-greasy-yummy-awesome Chinese food.  Please do not expect it to be anything else.

The portions are great.  The food is good, fresh, tasty Americanized Chinese food.

Unless we are looking for Buffet, Hop Feng is our place.

The staff is friendly and polite.  The service is quick, even on Friday nights.  

Any of the ""Garlic Sauce"" dishes are my favorite.  The house Lo Mein is superb.  The fried dumplings are awesome. Crab Rangoons - yum! Happy Family is also great.

Before I just list the whole menu, I'll just stop...  I have never gotten anything bad there.",5
Restaurants,"I enjoyed every dish I have had there. I'm a huge fan of their General Tso's chicken and egg drop soup. They have some amazing dishes, and they pile your plates with food.",4
Restaurants,Drive-thru open 24 hours and the staff is always great.  One of the best McDonalds in the area.,5
Restaurants,"High volume shop, but they serve quick and concise. Haven't had a bad experience having been here on many occasions.",5
Restaurants,"While eating at the Callabridge McDonalds, I had the displeasure of hearing an employee say, ""I can't stand working with those ""F"" Niggers.""  The environment there used to be nice, friendly and professional, but now...  What happened?  It's nothing now to hear the employees out in the lobby LOUDLY ranting and cursing.",1
Restaurants,This place has a great selection and great  roasted chicken... Also try the churro's,5
Restaurants,"Worth a visit just for the rotisserie chicken. It is awesome! It's the kind of chicken that after you finish your serving, you keep picking at it to try to find a little speck of goodness that you left behind, just hoping you weren't thorough. 

The owner is very friendly and makes you feel at home. Always a nice touch. The other staff members seem equally friendly. 

My only issue is that the menu seems a bit schizophrenic - like they can't decide exactly what kind of restaurant they want to be. For example, the mac and cheese is Kraft. Why even serve it? Stick with what you do best - chicken and Latin influenced meals and sides. 

Go though, try it - you won't regret it, just stick with what seems logical on the menu.",4
Restaurants,"I will attest, for over a year I walked right by the roasting oven in search of other ethnic delights at the plaza fiesta, but to my dismay the greek place in the mall shut down and i decided to try something new. The roasting oven did not disappoint, chicken was and is super on point, their hot sauces are GREAT, sandwiches are delicious. Like so many other ethnic places, the owner/employee's do a poor job of marketing themselves (they just yell things like chicken when people walk by) but the food is great, service is quick efficient and friendly, and that darn hot sauce is so good (the yellow one). 4 stars it IS!",4
Restaurants,"I've walked past the Soup Factory numerous times on my way into Barriques. I decided to finally stop in yesterday.

Now, as you can guess, this place's focus is....SOUP. They do have a wide selection of salads and sandwiches(both hot and cold). I decided to try the chicken and mushroom stew, and half of a caprese sandwich. I really like it when I have the half sandwich option, so I don't feel stuffed to the brim adding a soup. 

The stew was really good, almost as good as my fave at Java Cat! The sandwich was decent, but nothing amazing. It's pretty easy to smear pesto on a slice of bread with tomato and mozzarella and squeeze it on a griddle!

I'll definitely be stopping back in to try another soup this fall/winter!",3
Restaurants,"The soup wasn't bad, but the guy who was serving it was really creepy and totally ruined the entire experience. Plus, they were out of my first and second choices even though they were supposed to be open for 2 more hours.",2
Restaurants,"I didn't know what to expect from The Soup Factory, but I liked what I found! I visited around noon on a weekday and the place was hopping with what seemed to be a local business crowd. I ordered the Cheesy Caprese sandwich and loved it. I sampled some of the soups as well and all were good, but maybe not great. There are about 8 different varieties of soup to choose from each day, everything from different chilis to stews to bisques--you won't get bored. And a regular menu of salads and sandwiches is available. Friendly, hard-working staff.",4
Restaurants,"Went here for a Father's Day breakfast.  Besides lunch and dinner, they also serve breakfast all day.  Nice folks, darn good diner food, nice size portions.  Lots of old people come here, but they don't try to mug you in the bathroom or anything like that.",4
Restaurants,Found  hair in my food.  BLECH!!  Never ever again!,1
Restaurants,I cannot wait until sir hobos open up again. This place has the best breakfast anywhere!  The skillet are to die for. This service is as good as any diner in Chicago.,5
Restaurants,Now reopen and beautiful.  Come in and check it out.,4
Restaurants,"Absolutely horrible.  

The building has been recently remodeled because it burned.  I'd guess the insurance company didn't cover a replacement broom, vacuum and cleaning supplies. My arms stuck to the new table, the floor was really littered with garbage and my silverware was dirty.  Gross.  It was 2pm on Sat and dead.  No excuse for dirty.

The waitress was really nice, I think her name was Sarah.  She was personable and attentive.  She's the only reason I'd give this place a star at all.

I ordered a Gyro sandwich.  It came with fries and a bowl of soup.  I ordered Broccoli Cheese soup.  I think if I heated up some Velveeta and added a gallon of water to it, then tossed in a bunch of dirty, uncut broccoli, I could duplicate the Sir Hobo recipe.

I wish the rest of the meal was that good.  When the Gyro arrived, it reeked of rotten deer carcass, the plate was filthy and the fries were colder than Alaska in December.  I'm not joking.  The Gyro tasted so bad that I had to spit a mouthful of it into a napkin and slug down a glass of water to cleanse the horse-s--t taste from my mouth.  

Sarah noticed that I hadn't eaten my food, she offered to remove it from the bill with out me asking.  I would normally applaude that gesture, but some older foreign lady (I assume the owner) came over and told her not to do that.  ""I'll make you new sandwich,"" said the old lady. I declined.  I figured I couldn't choke down another bite of the garbage they call food.  I paid my 9 dollars for a lousy cup of liquid Velveeta and left.

I bet the Dairy Queen across the parking lot is glad that Sir Hobo's is back open.  I wonder how many people have done what I did... walk to DQ and had an ice cream cone to try to clean the aftertaste of death and decay from my mouth.  Never again.  I'd go to DQ instead.",1
Restaurants,"This place is always packed; however, the increased popularity is working against it. I took my mother, step father, and fellow siblings here for Mother's day. It took fifteen minutes just to get the attention of the waitress. When the food finally arrived three out of five of the orders were completely wrong. The waitress basically just negotiated back and forth with us until we agreed to eat what we were served. 

On a side note, the owner (older lady) kept staring at our table with a look in her eye that could have gotten her a role in the movie Scarface.

Unfortunately, the owners no longer care about quality like they did before the business burnt down. It's just a numbers thing at this point.

They lost a lifer that day.",1
Restaurants,"I recently went here with my family for breakfast and I look forward to going back soon. The menu had many options for breakfast, even for Vegetarians, which I am. I had the Veggie Skillet which was delisious and my husband enjoyed his inlet as well. The portions where large and the quality was high. A very clean place with a very friendly wait staff. Good kids menu too!",4
Restaurants,"We used to live in Sun Prairie years ago when we first moved to Wisconsin.  The first place we ate at was Sir Hobos.  At the time, the menu was really basic and not much seemed to be ""homemade"".  To be honest, we stopped going there.  As was mentioned below, there was a fire and they did a complete redo of the restaurant.  The food seems a bit better.  I do agree, though, with another ""Yelper's"" judgement on the cheese soup.  Yuk.  It's so thick, it heaps up on the spoon.  I've eaten there a few times since the rebuild and it seems they are trying to change.  I hope they try a bit harder this time.

A note:  No carpeting this time around.  It's very noisy.  And the TV's do not help.",3
Restaurants,"NEVER going back to this place.  We went for breakfast as a table of four.  It was packed, Sunday morning breakfast.  Three of the four breakfasts went back.  Two of those came wrong again.  One of those came back wrong a third time.  It took so long for the waitress to come back my wife had nibbled on it, eating around the block of Velveeta she specifically asked to be cheddar.  When we asked for consideration on the bill, we were told that she had eaten it, so no discount would be given.  We asked to see the manager.  The waitress returned and threw the bill on the table saying that she would take the breakfast out of her tips.  When we told the hostess, she offered a 10% discount off the bill.  Too Little Too Late.  There is no excuse for a menu omelet (that's right, not a special order, menu) to come out wrong three times.",1
Restaurants,"We went back here for the second time since the remodel.  Both times we had breakfast items.  We've never had lunch or dinner food here, and from reading other reviews it would appear that is a good thing.  

The remodeling looks nice, and it's now a no-smoking establishment.  But neither of these two aspects can apparently help the fact that your elbows and/or arms are going to stick to the tables.  Maybe it's a trap!  Like flies on sticky paper!  

Service was good both times, and breakfast food is solid.  But if they can't keep the tables clean, what else is filthy dirty?",2
Restaurants,"I want to write nice things.. I sooo want to write nice things.. so here goes.. the place has a nice warmth to it.. family friendly, which is always a plus for us... well that's it

food- just not good.. wife's reuben- the corned beef tasted.. let's go with questionable. Kids got hot dogs, ugh, just buy a better brand people! I had the Gyro.. it was serviceable, a little heavy on the sauce, but fine.

Service- waitress didn't give a d*mn about anything.. so yeah.. 2 stars.. maybe we will try again, but I don't think so",2
Restaurants,"We went here for a family Christmas brunch last month. Having lived in town for nearly 20 years, we had always seen but never actually been to SIR Hobo's. We had no idea what we were missing. When we first sat down, we were greated by a jolly waitress with a thick, possibly Greek accent. Her nametag said her name was Gerestina, but her attitude said she loved her job. The complimentary water was, in a word, exquisite. And the meal only got better. But the biggest surprise was when, about 20 minutes into our meal, a homeless man with a whooping cough and a peg leg stumbled through the door and colapsed. The cook came crashing out of the kitchen, carrying a CPR mask in one hand and a bloody meat cleaver in the other. Through his quick action, the cook was able to resucitate the homeless man. As we all applauded, the homeless man stood up to shake the cook's hand. The homeless man was crying and gave every single person in the restaurant a great big bear hug. It seems that SIR hobos still certainly cares for our fine city's hobo community.",5
Restaurants,"It is what it is, a nice local diner-type place.  It's not going to knock your socks off, but it beats throwing money at chain restaurants and the food is usually above par.",4
Restaurants,"Restaurant looks good on the inside but the food itself you could make better at home.  Seriously I just had a the Two For Four or whatever they call it and got two pancakes, two eggs and bacon.  The menu item itself gives you 2 sausage links and 2 bacon but the waitress told me I could get all bacon (4 slices) in lieu of bacon and sausage but neglected to explain it cost an extra $2.  Service was extremely slow and the owners don't speak very good english when you try to expalin the problems to them.  Overall, I intend to never return as there are other fantastic breakfast places within miles of this place.",1
Restaurants,"This place is just great! We have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it has been great every time. It is so cheap and you always get so much food and so
fast to. They have a huge menu which is awesome! The workers are always so happy and take good care of you! They just remodeled it and it looks so nice inside and the bathrooms are always clean. Great place!",4
Restaurants,"The 4-5 times we've been here, we have always received prompt and friendly service. The menu has good variety and plenty of choices. The food is great and comes in portions too big to finish. I highly recommend Sir Hobo's for breakfast.",4
Restaurants,"Tonight i took my 8 yr old little girl to this restaurant for dinner this evening and had the most horrible experience of my life. Don't go here if your a good looking woman because it doesn't matter if your with your child or not because you will be leered at by the owner as well as all the male staff. And even be hit on by the disgusting cook...not sure if these men are albanian or mexican but they were disgusting pervs! Waitress came to my table and said Carlos the cook says ""Hi."" I said ""what1?"" and she said he said he knows you...really!? Told her well i don't know him. I told her then ask him what my name is....she did and came back and says he thinks you look like someone he has seen before. WOW! Unbelievable and with my little girl there. I guess all blonde good-looking white woman look alike and Carlos knows them all! Owner was made aware and i asked to have cook come apologize to me and my daughter for ruining our evening. Owner didn't seem very apologetic and i personally think owner went back and told his staff to check me out because as soon as we were seated i saw him go into kitchen and a few minutes later some guy came out of the back and eyeballed me the whole time he walked by my booth. DISGUSTING....i will never be back there again! BTW, not that it matters, but i was wearing sweater up to my neck and above the knee skirt with flats....hair up. I am an RN BSN and BS degree in biology. Felt like i was being treated and leered at like i'm some stripper on a pole!!! Bus boy asked what happened and was appalled as well as waitresses...upon leaving owner didn't offer any compensation but waitress came and said we fare so sorry here is a piece of chocolate cake. Food sucked and i through left overs and cake in garbage. Hadn't been to this restaurant in yrs and will never go again!",1
Restaurants,"Ate here yesterday, had some good lunch at good $$. Saw my friend that works here, made some good business calls, talk business with my friend.
Free Wi-Fi is always nice. 
Had a good and productive hour.
I like Sir Hobos.
I will come back.",5
Restaurants,"This is one of the more generic ""family"" places out there, but I actually did enjoy it.
Now, I'm one of those folks who believes breakfast should be served three times a day, so my breakfast in the afternoon hit the spot.
The sausage was tasty and the hashbrowns were just perfect.

Someone else got the shrimp basket. While the shrimp itself was meh, the serving was huge, and the breading was quite good.

I'm sure some other options are subpar; just reading the menu turned me off to a few of them, but for breakfast, this is your spot.",4
Restaurants,"Great atmosphere, food is good. Staff is very friendly with good customer service skills. I like the diversity of who they employ. I routinely visit over the lunch hour. Breakfast food is the best. It nice to have a local hometown restaurant that's been around for awhile",5
Restaurants,"I've only been there for breakfast, but it's good solid diner food.",3
Restaurants,"We stopped for brunch on the way home from an overnight trip. Our food came out pretty quickly and was delicious.  I was expecting Perkins-quality food and was happy to find it was much better!  

The decor was not what we expected - at all!  Big screen tv, awesome rustic chairs at the tables, frosted glass and stone room dividers - it was nice!

I ordered the Two Four You breakfast combo - 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, 2 pieces of sausage, 2 pieces French toast.  The only complaint I had was that the bacon was a little over cooked. The sausage was legit sausage - not like freezer links you can warm up in the microwave in 30 seconds.  It was all good.   Aaron had the Irish skillet - which he gets everywhere we go - it was good as well. Portions were great. We left feeling satisfied, but not like we over did it.

Our waitress was so sweet and attentive - we tipped her 50% of the bill just for being so awesome.  We are glad we stopped!",4
Restaurants,"I have been here several times and this place never disappoints!  Always fast, friendly service and the place is spotless!  I usually order one of their breakfast skillets, but I've tried other things and it's all been great!  They have a very good selection, so it's not difficult to find the thing you're in the mood for!",5
Restaurants,"The food is very good for the price. The salads and fruit cup are always fresh and tasty. Their serving one salad now with salmon, mixed greens and strawberries that is wonderful. 
The service is quick, through and friendly. The coupon in the weekly paper is great at defraying the cost too.  It's a great place all the way around. It's a family restaurant that accommodates for that nicely. 
I strongly recommend it.",5
Restaurants,"Run by college students for college students. Which is good if you are a UW student, bad for everyone else. I have seen fellow students get fat sandwiches and extras for no extra cost. While the rest of the world gets a skinny sandwich and crap service.

Restaurants,"Dorcas is one of the best Korean restaurant in CU in my opinion. I love their combos because I always get to try different dishes. My favorite is their grilled mackerel. They give you tonnes of food as you can see from the pictures. The taste is not bad but they need to add more variety to their menu.

Update: I retract my last statement. I went there again this weekend and their menu has a lot to choose from. The hot and spicy squid was really good.",4
Restaurants,"I don't know why, but when I feel like getting Korean to go, I come to Dorca's instead of Woori Jib.  It is a little more expensive than what you would find outside of Champaign, but that doesn't stop me from frequenting this place.  

You get very sizeable portions.  I always get their bbq chicken (bulgolgi's also very good, but I'm a white-meat eater) and it comes with a shitload of rice, side of kimchi, a few potstickers, some rice noodles... basically enough food to last me two to three meals.  If you don't carry out, you get free refills on soup and rice.

Great, great food and fast service.  I love this place!",4
Restaurants,"Dorcas is a very standard Korean restaurant... that Koreans actually go to! The portions are substantial, soups authentic, and banchan wonderfully served. This place reminds me of cafeterias back in Seoul, and not necessary all in a good way. The interior is clearly not meant for show, and while you know what? It makes the food stand out even better!",4

Public Services & Government,"I have taken a ride on the light rail a few times now and I have some stories!! The first time I rode the light rail I took it from Mill Ave to Phoenix to see the D-Backs and Cubs play. My friends had caught a tram in Mesa so I sat there and watched a few trams come and go before I got onto the one with my friends on it. That was easy enough...there was enough room for me and the ride was smooth and fun (though I can't say it was relaxing)...Any ways. After the game was quite an experience! The tram ride home was a little more crowed now that the game had let out. There were two die hard fans in our car from the two teams who started talking trash to each other...well one of them had a little too much to drink and one thing lead to another and they were soon yelling threats at each other. Right before the drunker one took a swing (in a very crowded car) an older man stood up and shut them both up before someone got hurt...the tension in the air was thick the whole way back to Tempe where the Cub fan got off and punched the window. The friends of the other guy had to hold him back...I mean come on!! 

Okay, then I had the pleasure of using the light rail to go to the Circus. Again I was headed to Phoenix but this time I got on at the Washington stop. It was again a fun ride, but I couldn't say that it was a relaxing ride...there was this bum who was asking people for money and I think it would be better with some music playing in the background...any ways the ride home wasn't as eventful as the baseball game crowd, but again, there was another bum asking for money...can people just ride in peace?

I like the light rail - I really do...it's always an interesting experience, but I just don't feel safe on it. I used to take the metro bus from Gilbert to Mesa every day for a while and I felt safer on that then I do on the light rail and the bums who ride the bus don't ask me for money either.",2
Public Services & Government,"I want to like the Light Rail, I really do, I even voted for it. Having moved to Phoenix from a city with a great public transportation system(Chicago) and having visited other large cities with great Public transportation systems, I wanted this for Phoenix too. I wanted to live is a city where owning a car was optional.  The Phoenix light rail is a huge disappointment. It is so darn slow...insanely slow, maddeningly slow, not only does it stop at every station but being at grade(street level), it also stops at the majority of stop lights too. Let's be honest, if you own a car you will not be riding the Light rail regularly, it just takes too much time and time is money, it takes like 3 times as long as just driving, heck I could probably ride a bicycle faster...seriously. Phoenix having been developed after Americans became dependent on automobiles has an well maintained & fast  freeway/ surface road system compared to other major metropolitan areas(kudos to ADOT). 
     The majority of people who ride the light rail appear to be poor people who don't own cars, which brings me to my next points, there are tons of panhandlers constantly harassing anyone that appears to have money and without exception every time I have ridden the Light Rail I have seen a knock down drag out MMA style fight on the train with people recording it and yelling ""World Star"". There is little to no security or police presence, if you are elderly, a woman or have children, forget it I would not recommend it, I'm a large male and I kept my back against the wall & head on a swivel expecting a kerfuffle.   
One star...I don't know what the public transportation solution is for Phoenix but this isn't it.",1
Public Services & Government,"#NWExtension is finally open!  After 3 long years of our neighborhood being on the trail of the #NWExtension and have adapted to the turmoil, closures and dust.  Now it's all paid off because we have a beautiful new rail a couple blocks away.  Beautifully landscaped and station art by local schoolchildren and artists.  They did a very good job and it's fun to have the rail so close and easy.  Now trips downtown or to the East Valley are easier, greener (even though we have a hybrid) and no parking hell to deal with.  That is a beautiful thing now that parking downtown is so expensive.  This is awesome and today marked the grand opening.  The trains are running on 19th Ave and it's really kind of nice to hear it a couple of blocks away when outside.  Calming.",5
Local Flavor,"The smell, the vibe and feel as soon as I opened my car door was apparent. This is very Asian for the likes of pretty much every street corner in parts of LA. I only wish we had a more concentrated ethnic specific area beyond south Phoenix like LA.. or any other city for that matter. Hell, look at the Asian part of town in Vegas, its awesome!",4
Local Flavor,"First off, this is not a china town as some keep trying to say and then act as if it were substandard. It is the Chinese Culture Center , big difference. And for what it is I enjoy stopping and checking out the various shops and restaurants along with the great grocery. As a whole I enjoy this place. This place that is not China Town.",4
Local Flavor,"It's unique and it's in Phoenix, for that alone it gets 5 stars.  This is a fun place to kill a couple of hours with out of town visitors or on a date.  Stroll through the gardens. Wander through the grocery store, (yes it stinks but it's part of the ambiance) and look a all the strange and gross foods. Try one of the restaurants, but not Quizno's that doesn't count.  Check out the curio shops for some odd trinket to take home with you.",5
Local Flavor,"My husband was born and raised as a British Expat in Hong Kong and loves the Chinese Cultural Center for its authenticity. There are some great, inexpensive and authentic restaurants there serving a wide variety of Chinese foods. There is a place called the Seafood Buffet on the west end of the plaza and the food there is fantastic and lunch during the week is around $7. Golden Buddha (next to the amazing wedding shop) has an inexpensive lunch menu and I've heard the Dim Sum is incredible. 

The grocery store in that plaza has tons of authentic Asian foods that you won't be able to find anywhere else. Just the smell of the different foods and spices takes me back to my last trip to Hong Kong and really adds to the experience. I don't know what half the stuff there is, but if you wander through the candy aisle you should pick up a few random pieces and just try something different. 

The Center has a festival around the Chinese New Year  where they have street vendors selling all kinds of goodies including a huge selection of decorative Koi fish and various cultural performances. It's really a unique place, especially here in Phoenix, and is worth an afternoon visit if you're looking for something different.",4
Local Flavor,"The Chinese Cultural Center was a great distraction from a busy Phoenix day.  There was plenty of parking and getting there is easy off the 202. The center has several shops that sell furniture and accessories, herbs, apparel, etc. There are several places to eat.  We ate at the Golden Buddha - very beautiful inside with an aquarium and attractive seating area. Good food, but be ready to deal with ordering some stuff you may not understand at first. After lunch we went to the food market.  Really cool to walk around and see all the different stuff.  You definitely won't see these ingredients down at the local super market.  You are guaranteed to have a good time looking around. Have fun!",4
Local Flavor,"While I'm no expert on Chinese culture, I do enjoy the cuisine. The Cofco Center is an interesting place to visit, and there is no shortage of new dishes to try at the various restaurants. The Lao Ching Hing restaurant was very good, and not difficult to get in and out of during a lunch hour. 

The Asian Seafood Buffet used to be one of the places my coworkers and I would go when we were really short on time. The food was all right, and there was a decent sushi bar in the middle. However, during our last visit we came back to our table and found a roach waiting for us. Inexpensive or not, cleanliness is a big deal.",3
Local Flavor,"This place is essentially a strip mall, but offers more than the usual strip mall options. The biggest attraction is its architecture, as its designed with  traditional Chinese architecture. The top floors hold office space, the bottom retail and restaurant space. Facing 44th Street is a beautiful garden. There's a large goldfish pond on the south side,with small bridges and walkways over and around it. There are numerous statues and pagodas along the south and east side of the building. It's a beautiful and relaxing addition to the city. There is a large store that sells Asian goods, namely furniture and decorative items. The owners are very nice and friendly. There is also a bridal gown shop and Asian video store next to it. Ranch Market owns a large grocery store that sells Asian foods, though in my opinion LeeLee Market in Chandler has a better selection. There are several restaurants and a coffee shop as well. The Golden Buddha is excellent and the wait staff moves fast. During the day, you can order dim sum from carts the wait staff pushes around the dining floor. The food is excellent and you may be able to get a seat overlooking the aforementioned goldfish pond. It's definitely worth a trip.",5
Local Flavor,"Honestly I go here rarely.  My recent visit was to watch my godson while his parents were doing family picture photo shoot in the Chinese gardens and pond areas.  You can walk the whole cultural center and its gardens in 10 minutes, so there isn't alot of sightseeing here.  But to get a little glimpse of some replica gardens and seating structures from China, where else to go?  So 4 stars for the somewhat idyllic gardens in back behind the shopping plaza, cuz there isn't any other place in the valley like it.",4
Local Flavor,"COFCO Chinese Cultural Center is located in Phoenix, Arizona; it is downtown and fairly easy to locate. There are several different stores and restaurants located within the center that anyone may go and explore when they want to. On my first journey here I parked outside of the supermarket called Ranch Market. On the outside and on the inside it looks like a typical grocery store that you would find in Arizona, such as a Safeway of Fry's; the only main difference is the produce and items that they sell. Each aisle is stocked with unique foods, candies, drinks... Their fresh produce section, along with their ""deli"" section was the most interesting thing to me personally.  You can find crazy colored and shaped produce that you typically would never see at a Safeway. The ""deli"" section was filled with baby octopus to fresh fish. Ranch Market offers many Chinese cultural foods. The only main down side is that it smelled strongly of seafood, because of their foods they offer in the market. 

Visiting the market, my friend and I walked around the rest of the center. We found the Chinese Cultural Botanical Garden. This was my favorite part of the whole center, because it is a beautiful garden set up around a large pond filled with lily pads, fountains, statues, and koi fish. Around the pond you could walk along a path that had interesting marble statues that you could read, observe, and touch if you wanted to. The statues had plaques in English and Chinese that you could read, in order to learn the history of what it is that you were looking at. The Botanical Garden is nicely set up as a little journey pathway. The architecture is extremely interesting and vibrant. I did not think that there was a single down side but I would suggest that you go the the botanical garden when it is nice and cool outside. Because it is all outside, you would not want to be walking around trying to enjoy it in 100 degree weather. 

Lastly my friend and I decided to walk into a small shop called The Oriental Factory Direct. This was a shop filled to the brim with Chinese cultural artifacts, clothing, weapons, pieces of art, jewelery, stationary... You could find almost anything in this shop. The atmosphere was extremely welcoming and calming. My favorite part of this shop was looking around at everything they offered for me to buy. The shop keeper was also tremendously friendly; she was eager to answer any of our questions and teach us anything we wanted to learn about. I loved the atmosphere and the people here.

I gave the COFCO Chinese Cultural Center  a good rating, because I completely enjoyed the new experience. It can be a good drive for some people, but if you live near it, it is extremely convenient. The only thing I would have done differently was given myself more time to enjoy the other restaurants and shops. And i definitely would have gone when it was cooler outside. This center is very unique, beautiful, and fun.",4
Local Flavor,"I love visiting the Chinese Cultural Center. There's a really cool replica garden and quite a few restaurants. I'm always drawn to the Ranch Market full of Asian goodies. This market reminds me of the stores I used to frequent in Seattle/Tacoma. I haven't actually eaten at any of the restaurants there yet, but it's coming. What a great place to go check out something different and check out some new foods in the market.",5
Local Flavor,"This is my neighborhood stop and as close to what you get for a ""china town"" here in PHX.

The Ranch Market is my grocery store and the Golden Buddha is the watering hole I am closest to and its been fun to be exposed to something ""different"" in the neighborhood. Yeah it's a strip mall with a coy pond and garden to those in other more metropolitan back ground or source, but it's what we got! ( I knocked off that last star for a reality check).  Within the center their are doctors offices, apartments and travel agencies that specialize in travel to Asia. Our stops signs are in Chinese too to paint a picture. All nationalities get their fresh fish at the market and you have to try the bakery for arguably the best chau siu bao hands down.

A definite place to go for lunch if you are here.
Walking through the gardens is the best attraction to walk off the dum sum. Its ponds and series of bridges and temple type architecture will make you feel less like you are under the flight path of PHX and more like you are on a different latitude and longitude if even for a second... 

Adjacent to the airport it represents a grain of cultural sand in a desert of fast food restaurants and Circle K's that is most of phoenix.
Short walking distance from the 44th ST Light rail station where one could possible stumble to while on a light rail jaunt Tempe / PHX bound.  Also next to main airport destination and hotels including a ""W"" and parking to the airport.

It's a pretty industrialized neighborhood outside but it contains some of the best Chinese restaurants in the valley as well Chinese medicine shop and other various shops hardly found anywhere else in AZ.",4
Local Flavor,"They have a 99 Ranch supermarket that stocks all the awesome asian necessities like tendon, tripe and chicken feet. However,the area is almost barren with hardly any businesses. They should really step this place up do some development and market this area. They have plenty of parking which is non-existant back home in Honolulu.",3
Local Flavor,"5 stars for the fact that Phoenix even has a Chinese Cultural Center area.  The only place I've been to in it is the grocery store but one day, I plan to check-out the lil gardens and restaurants.  Can't wait until they get more in there! (Don't go expecting a big Chinatown-like scene.)

The take-out from inside the grocery store is pretty tasty, inexpensive and fast!

See ya there!",5
Local Flavor,"The Ranch Market is the ONLY place I have been able to find that has had my miniature money tree!! I have looked all over the Untied States since my last one died with no luck until today. Needless to say I was absolutely thrilled beyond belief!!! I must also give them credit for promptly returning my lost LV wallet! THANK YOU for being honest!!! =)

The import store over next to the Golden Buddha has a great selection of different Chinese figurines, Buddhas, furniture, bamboo, fountains, miniature tea sets, Hung Bao, etc... Always a joy to go in there and browse around. Last time I walked out of there $200 poorer!! hehehe 

Check it out. It's a small complex but lots of browsing fun. Enjoy.",5
Local Flavor,"Really fun place to go on your lunch break.  They have plenty of dining options (some better than others), great stuff in the Ranch Market, and beautiful grounds with a koi pond and replicas of Chinese sculptures.",4
Local Flavor,"I realize I'm from Houston, and I've been to San Francisco's Chinatown, but wow, this is a pretty dismal place. The cultural center is beautiful, but unfortunately, there was one grocery store, 3 restaurants, and 2 knick-knack stores (at very high prices) open. The rest of the cultural center was empty and advertising for rent space. After you eat lunch, you can cover the entire cultural center in about 5-10 minutes.

However, I think the greatest disappointment was that 2 days before Chinese New Year, the cultural center was not decorated. Furthermore, the grocery or knick knack stores had very little decorations to buy and bring home. What a disappointment, especially for the biggest holiday of the year!",2
Local Flavor,"Not China Town, but more like China Oasis

This is the closest thing to a China Town in Phoenix.  There is not comparison to the ones in LA or NY, but there is a lot of character present.  I usually come here for Dim Sum at Golden Buddha and go to the L Ranch Supermarket, but it is small and quaint, but does give a fun representation of the Zen Chinese in the Koi Fish Pond and garden.  Don't expect LA or NY China Town, but not bad for the desert. 

If you find this useful, funny or cool, please check below.",4
Local Flavor,"If you go here expecting to find a ""China Town"" you will be disappointed.  However, this place does not market it's self as a Chinatown. It is a cultural center which holds special events and displays as related to the Chinese culture. What a great place to relax in the garden. Also has some wonderful restaurants, shops a business center and a Chinese grocery store there.",4
Local Flavor,"For Phoenix, this is pretty great. In all honesty it is only slightly worse than DC chinatown so we should be pretty proud. (DC just dubs over chains with chinese writing). I agree, not at all comparable to NYC or Chicago's Chinatown but delicious and a great inexpensive grocery store with all the specialties (just no fake purses or as big of a selection of stores).",4
Local Flavor,Most of the place is closed right now. I was told it was remodeling but I am not sure.  What is there is good but there is not much to see right now at the cultural center.,3
Local Flavor,"I've driven by this place many times and have said to myself that I need to go and check it out. Well with it being the 2013 Phoenix Chinese Week, I had no reason not too. 

The architecture is pretty neat. 

The market has some many cool and different products you will not find at Frys or Safeway. I could spend a good two hours going up and down the isles checking everything out. 

There is an herbal store the smelled of earthy tea upon entering. I quickly became overwhelmed as everything was in Chinese (which for the record I cannot read or speak, outside of the brief lesson when I open a fortune cookie). They had so many containers and boxes that I chalked up that if I'm really that interested, I'll make another trip in the future when it isn't so crowded.",3
Local Flavor,"Always a fun visit....typically for the Lunar New Year celebration, but also for the Full Moon festival in Autumn any time is good to visit...great year round shopping and Asian market.",4
Local Flavor,"For being in the middle of Phoenix/desert, this place looks real nice. There are several events held here throughout the year including Chinese New Years celebrations and the Fall Moon Festival. Not usually the most entertaining performances. The International market that's in this center is AWESOME. You can find just about anything here that doesn't exist in the US!",3
Local Flavor,"When I want to just get away for awhile I come here, and let my mind relax...over all its not that big but worth checking out!!  It also has food and shops to enjoy this great culture.",4
Local Flavor,"Not a large cultural center, but it does have several Asian shops and a large Asian gocery store.",4
Local Flavor,"Maybe it was just me but this place was a bit of a let down.

The bakery was passable and I found the food selection to be inferior to Mekong, Lee Lee's, and Asiana Market in Mesa and Tempe.

The Chinese Culture part is a bit of joke really, if culture can be absorbed by walking through oriental themed buildings and the grocery. 

One could glean more Chinese Culture in Chandler imo",3
Local Flavor,"Chinese themed strip mall which or local take on a china town, houses a wide range of businesses aimed at that demographic. Of note is the grocery store which is huge and has a pretty decent little restaurant in the corner. Did I mention that it was also cheap, yeah, that too.",3
Local Flavor,"Phoenix has a large but scattered population. I'm not sure why developers picked this location for a Chinese Culture Center.  It doesn't make sense to me as the area around Dobson might seem more appropriate.

The center seems like it'd have potential if it gave incentive for small businesses to set up shop and stay.  I've heard the lunar festival held here charged admission and was dismal.  It's now not much more than a nearly-empty strip mall with ""Asian"" architecture.  I live up the street and would rather drive to Mesa/Chandler for anything Asian. Sad because I hoped Phoenix could do better.",2
Local Flavor,"Not the best but not the worst Chinese food.

Had the Schezwan Shrimp for lunch. Egg drop soup was brought out promptly and the main course after two spoonfuls of the soup.

Soup was nothing special. Egg roll almost flavorless and mushy. No ability to substitute Lo mein for rice. Better like rice. This IS a Chinese restaurant right? 

Everything came out on same plate. Cold salad next to hot entree next to hot rice. Most places serve these separately. Obviously a move to save servers work.

Iced tea was basically water. 

Check was delivered halfway through meal. Thank you very much. You may go now.",2
Local Flavor,"This place is awesome, I like coming here and going to the shops and looking at all sorts of diff things",5
Local Flavor,"If the Chinese economy has a ""hard landing,"" it will look like Cofco Cultural Center. 

Most of the storefronts are empty. There's one gift store, woefully declaring ""yes, we're open!"" There are restaurants on either side of Ranch Market that may be the same restaurant with different names. The architecture is pretty in a ""Disney does China"" way, but it's essentially a strip mall with a high vacancy rate, anchored by a supermarket.",1
Local Flavor,"Having a Filipino wife means lots of trips to the Asian store located here. The place looks grate. Like a little slice of china. The Asian shipping store usually sales many much of whats needed for my wifes Filipino dishes. As well some hard to find items for chief's. Like frog legs. 

There are two restraints.  Here one has sone great food. The other is like any other Chinese restaurant. There are a few trinket stores. But other then that, the place has a lot of empty store fronts. So it kinda has a ghost town feel to it.

The parking lot and surrounding area is kept very clean. 

Simply put - The place is nice,  but has a lot of unused potential.",3
Local Flavor,"Check out the Dorayaki at the Ranch Market, if you get there on time, they make a red bean paste pancake on a griddle in front of the store. Deelish! Go to the Szechwan Palace and request the non-English menu for the true authentic items. The gift shop has tons of gift ideas if you are stumped. I might also mention they have some really, really nice shrines made out of cherry wood and lacquer. I was in the market for one to make my altar and these are the real deal. Beautiful furniture finds, although they can be a bit pricey. They are willing to negotiate with you if you ask. 

The store has what you need but the variety may seem lacking in comparison to Lee Lee's or Mekong. Anything you try at the bakery is amazing, if you are in the mood for perfect deco-den like whipped cream cakes, this is the place to get it. Their fruit selection is lacking which is probably my only gripe, but they make up for it in their vegetable selection. The Chinese Herb shop next door is a great place if you are into holistic/Chinese medicine. I wish this place was bigger with more stores, that would definitely put it over the top.",5
Local Flavor,"After a couple days without caffeine, I was in the panicked, desperate, yet very composed search for instant coffee. I am traveling and coffee seems to be weak tea everywhere I've gone and I am too cheap to buy Starbucks every morning.Through previous experiences, Korean instant coffee packs are quite delightful! So I was on the search for said coffee packs. To begin my expedition I asked where I'd fine an Asian store, I was directed to a small store and after looking, they did not have what I was searching for. My second option found me here. Much smaller than what I expected, but I was able to find a product similar to the brand I was seeking and was completely satisfied!  Great products and very organized.",4
Local Flavor,"Bread grill pork bun, taste as good as always!",5
Local Flavor,"Unfortunately, this place is on a downward trajectory it appears. Many businesses have closed and there are many vacancies. The ones that are there, apart from the Asian Market have changed hands. Not bad, but not worth a special trip.",3
Local Flavor,"I'm reviewing purely the gardens here, not the actual stores or restaurants in this shopping plaza. It's a really nice area to come and walk around, take some pictures with the family, which is exactly what I did with my parents on Christmas day when nothing else was open. 

I don't have much to say other than that it's a really scenic spot great for a casual photo session. I'll let my pictures say the rest :)",4
Local Flavor,"Flavoring is not consistent. Sometimes it could be salty enough to do more than 
double serving. Counter Service were really poor as You have to wait and look for them.",2
Local Flavor,"Smelly Durian , fresh frogs and weird seafood, and S*** I cannot pronounce. Yup I'm at the Chinese Cultural center food market :) This place offers everything asain. From food to furniture. 

I love coming here and wondering down the aisles looking for cool stuff and food I would dare to try. This place also has many of restaurants in the surrounding area so dine in on some non-amaricanized Chinese food.

Also for a plus come on the weekends in the morning and catch them making sweet Chinese mini pancakes out front for 1$ a piece. There delicious and made on some weird special pan.

Located right off the 202 freeway this is a must see. They have plenty of statues , stores and history to take in.",5
Local Flavor,"This was a beautiful place to visit. It's free and would be fun for the family. You don't see what's in the back behind the 44th street view. There are restaurants, shops and a grocery store. Check it out, you won't be disappointed. Parking lot in the back.",4
Restaurants,"Weak.  This place is a far cry from the Mill Ave. location in Tempe.  Gone now.  Long Wong's quality is lost on this place.  I had pizza and wings and my slice was literally microwaved to heat it up after I ordered.  Bad, bad, bad.  Wings have always been decent, but there's really no reason to go there ever again.",1
Restaurants,"The wings at this LW were fantastic.  Not battered, but deep friend how they should be.  They were crispy and well done with a sauce that tastes fantastic (I got the hot).  From a wings standpoint, it totally gets a 4.5.  

I tried the ribs and they were pretty bad.  Everything else looked good though.  

If you want hot wings, this is the place to go.  I only wish they had some sort of hot-teriyaki sauce.  Oh well, can't be perfect.",4
Restaurants,"A far cry from the South Scottsdale location. The wings I ordered were ice cold! when I brought them back to the counter, the lady said nothing and threw them into a microwave. I kid you not! If you want good wings, try another location. PROS : I didn't get e-coli.",1
Restaurants,"Growing up in Phoenix, I have always eyed Long Wong's while in the family car.  

""Is it Chinese food?""

No.

My friend Ann R. had taken me there yesterday for lunch.  She had claimed these are the best wings ever and I was a bit skeptical.  I had ordered the Honey-Hot and my friend got Medium.  Upon first bite, it was pure bliss!  The wings were deep-fried perfectly and the sauce had me burning up with a sweet after-taste.  I also like how there's not too much vinegar in the sauce.  Food is brought to your table by a super friendly staff and then once you're done, you get to throw your trash into a giant hippo statue.  What?!

It's a bit small, definitely more hole-in-the-wall but not dumpy.  It's cluttered with lots of cool stuff to look at both inside and out.  Take your time and wander the premise!  Do try to avoid the bathrooms though.

This is by far the best place for wings!  If only they'd kick out annoying high school brats and the old creepers that gets too friendly...  XD!",5
Restaurants,"Growing up in Phoenix this was THE place to go to get wings! Before their redecorating back in 09' it was very ""cozy"" and very ""loud"" (I'm saddened to see it ""toned down"" after the redecoration) on the outside.

This is THE place to go for a great deal on wings. 12 for $5? 50 for $24? Hell yeah man! They deep-fry them perfectly - they're still juicy in the middle; the mild, medium, hot, suicide, teriyaki, bbq, honey hot, is really delicious. My family and I love mixing up the teriyaki and medium sauce to give it a great sweet/hot/tangy flavor.

When I moved to Tempe, I missed the place; and the other ones - Mill (even though they closed, I still tried them)? Scottsdale? Mesa? Uh, no. Nowhere NEAR as fantastic as compared to the first and original Long Wongs in Phoenix, AZ. I've even ate at the Long Wongs Bars and Grills - the prices were too much for me, 6 for $5? No thanks. I love it as they also take your food to your seats, but always remember to clean up after yourselves! The trash can is the huge Hippo statue by the door ;) The staff and owners are really awesome and sweet, I love playing Pinball and the old retro 80's arcade games while waiting for my food.

The second best Long Wongs I would have to give props to is the one on Indian School Rd - we found this other gem while the original Long Wongs was still remodeling (and they had given a list of other locations).",5
Restaurants,"I remember moving here about 5 years ago wondering what the heck is Long Wongs.  First thought of course was Chinese food, but boy was I surprised when people were talking about their wings.  Chinese people don't eat chicken wings!?  Well, behold my friends they serve burgers and fries too - whoa! (Joey Lawrence)  I must say this local chain is pretty cool.  This particular location showcases a lot of pictures of local patrons on their walls.  It's a little pooper kinda place, but I'll survive.  They definitely have some ba-donka-donk butt and thunder thigh items on their menu!  If you need some decent take out food by all means, enjoy!",3
Restaurants,"Long Wongs. How do I Love your Chicken Wings. Well these are pretty near heaven. The price seals the deal. Really don't need to say much else. Oh their Cupcakes rock and the Cheese sticks too. They sell other things too but why? Not so keen on the $5 12"" pizza though. Ugh.",4
Restaurants,"I don't know if their food is good and frankly, I don't care. All I know is that I have NEVER in my life been so appalled at the horrible level of customer service at this location and I'll never go back. I called in my order one night and was told it would be 15 minutes. When I got there (20 minutes later) my order wasn't ready. I waited an extra 15 minutes before asking how long it would be. When the cashier turned around to find our how much longer, the ex-con looking a*hole of a fry cook in the back shouted some obscenities at me, called me a liar about how long I had been waiting, and that was pretty much all I needed to hear before demanding a refund and walking out the door. Long Wong's can suck a fatty; personally I wish that nasty eyesore had stayed closed.",1
Restaurants,"No, the ""quaint"" building on Thomas doesn't look like a 5 star restaurant, but they've got the best wings I've found in Phoenix.  By far.  Oregano's, Buffalo Wild Wings, none of them compare with the greasy, spicy, juicy perfection of Long Wong's wings.  And they've got great prices.  My family of 4 will frequently order the bucket of 72 wings, for only $32.52.  For those of you who are curious, that's only 45 cents a wing!  Every day of the week!  We love the Hot and Honey Hot in particular, but all are delicious.  Although, the BBQ and Garlic Parmesan are a little too sauce-y for me.

Some others have criticized the service; I've never had a problem.  That being said, they do seem to have a limited staff.  Every time I've gone the same man and woman have been managing the restaurant.  It does get crowded around dinner time and there isn't really a clear system of lines for those who are picking up and those who are ordering.  Also, when they're busy you may not be able to call ahead.  Superbowl Sunday the phones were constantly busy so I ended up having to go in and order there, then wait.  But overall I've found the service to be just fine and the staff to be pleasant.

Not a place for a romantic dinner, but if you wanna see how comfortable you really are with your SO, take them here and watch each other stuff your faces with wing-goodness.  Yum",5
Restaurants,Really good prices but I would stray from the wings. It is very greasy so beware!,3
Restaurants,I always used to love the wings from here but in the past two years they have gone downhill...Customer service blows and the wings hardly have any meat on them.  Try another location they are all not the same.. Marcias Long Wongs in S. Phx is much better,2
Restaurants,"The hot wings, medium wings, bbq wings, and even the mild wings here are bursting with flavor! The nachos here are super simple and lack luster. Just nacho cheese sauce with yellow corn chips. No pico de gallo, guacamole, or meat. I see a lot of people ordering hamburgers at this place that is known for their wings. I have not tried a burger yet but they are popular so they must be half way decent. This place would get 5 stars if they had beer and if the place was bigger. When they are crowded during lunch you can be left eating out in the heat on their picnic tables. If you love wings and have not been to Long Wong's you are missing some tasty bird.",3
Restaurants,when you walk in its old school which is cool and the outside is cool but the food was medioca just a bit i would not give the a second shot now a different location maybe...,1
Restaurants,".I ordered the pizza and 2 dozen wings for me and a friend.  The wings weren't cooked as I asked....they were very wet rather than extra crispy and they gave only two small plastic cups of ranch, you know the ones I'm taking about, can't even fit the tip of a wing in the cup. After 8 wings the ranch was gone. 

As for the pizza...it is NOT fresh...I think it's actually a frozen pizza.  Was horrible and I couldn't even eat more than one slice...waste of my money.

The place is very dirty. The kitchen is falling apart, it makes me gag just looking at it. The dining area is filled with too much junk. It would be better if they take half the junk out of there and rid themselves of those old and unused arcade machines, broken toys and clocks and sun bleached decorations.
Dusting is not a priority. If a big gust of wind comes in when someone opens the door you better cover your food.


I think the only reason this place is somewhat busy at times is because there really isn't any other place in the immediate area. I also think people go there because it USED to be good.",1
Restaurants,"I ordered a dozen garlic Parmesan wings and a order of fried zucchini. Although they weren't the worst wings I've had, they definitely were no where close to being the best. The wings were cold, probably due to the gallon of wet sauce they were covered in. The zucchini was burnt. I was skeptical pulling into the parking lot because it looked like a carnival. Let me just say it looked the same way inside. The dining room was covered in carnival toys and looked like they haven't dusted in years. They had hand made menus all over the place. We also had a homeless visitor come in to our table and ask for money so he could eat. One word for this place YUK!",1
Restaurants,"If you could imagine what a restaurant would look like if you gave someone acid and told them to do some interior decorating, I am pretty sure this would be the outcome.  The outside includes statues of geese, hippos, buffalo's,  and assortment of other creatures.  The inside is wall to wall with stuff from Humpty Dumpty to an American flag to totem pole.   If only the food compared with this quirky atmosphere...

Long Wong's gets one star because the FOOD WAS AWFUL.  I ordered boneless chicken wings.  They were so hard and inedible that I broke my plastic fork trying to stab one to pick it up.  I am not talking a little freezer burn here but am talking hard as a rock.  The medium buffalo wing sauce was hot but had no flavor.  I also had a hot dog.  The bun was super stale and fell apart as I tried to eat the hot dog.  

The Costco style tables were filthy.  My child's high chair table is cleaner after she eats than the table we sat at.

If you bring your own food and table, you can enjoy the atmosphere. Otherwise, I highly don't recommend.",1
Restaurants,"The best hot wings in the Valley.  Hell, in the World.  I love their hot wings.  I recently spent 5 months on bed rest in Good Sam Hospital (a very rough pregnancy) and my husband would have to go get me Long Wong's Hot Wings just to satisfy my intense craving for them.   

What I like best about them is that they are well cooked so they aren't fatty, with big fat deposits in the chicken skin itself.  Nothing is grosser to me than biting into a chicken wing and getting a big mouthful of greasy, fatty flabby chicken skin.  YUCK.   Long Wong's wings are deep fried and come out meaty and chewy and little bit crispy.  Delicious!  Kinda like the perfectly browned skin on the Thanksgiving turkey, but covered in delicious hot wing sauce.  Someone once complained that they were similar to chicken jerky and I think that was a compliment!  The way they are cooked you can appreciate the meat and crispy skin and the sauce and you don't have to muck through a heavy breading or flabby, fatty chicken skin.  

Their $5 cheese pizza isn't bad either.  And for some odd reason their fountain Pepsi is somehow more yummy than most fountain dispensed Pepsi at other restaurants.  I don't know if they can adjust the mixture and in this case they are running a stronger Pepsi mixture?  All I know is it's better than most places.

Good cheap food.  I like it.",5
Restaurants,"My husband and I are new to Phoenix and have decided to try as many local places as possible. Intrigued by the outside decor, we ventured into this odd place. We ordered 2 meals and sat at a greasy, dirty table. 
Our wings and burger arrived and we were thoroughly disappointed. The wings (some spicy ranch and some garlic Parmesan) were soggy from the grease and extra chewy. The burger appeared to have been  put in the fryer with the wings. The bun was soggy and the patty doused in pepper. 
They did try to make their greasy food healthier by handing out sandwich bags with carrots and ranch. Good effort. 
The one star it gets is for decor and fries. The fries are great, just covered in salt (shake then it off and they will be fine.) The decor will keep you entertained and avoid awkward silences.",1
Restaurants,"I've been eating here since the 80s when they opened, we used to hit the place before the Friday night bar hop.  No matter what the other reviews say, I still think this place has some of the best wings I've ever had.  I will drive across the city 21 miles for their wings.",3
Restaurants,"We went there because of the ridiculous stuff that they had outside their building, and the inside was no different. But it was fun to go to. It's known for their hot wings, but the burgers that we ordered were amazing! Also the wings were drenched in sauce and tasted really good as well. It was a fun place to eat at, definitely recommend it for the wings and burgers.",5
Restaurants,"I love the cheap pizza & wings. Great food, great prices but it irritates the hell out of me that they always call the numbers out in Spanish.  I have to keep looking at the food being brought out to see if I recognize what I ordered.  That's just rude.",4
Restaurants,Interesting decor.  Fun little hole in the wall for greasy yummy burgers and fries!,3
Restaurants,"Came here for pizza and wings last night and the quality was WAY off. :(  

The pizza wasn't nearly as cheesy as normal and all the cheese wasn't even 100% melted, the crust seemed different that usual too.  Less doughy and fluffy and chewy and more like a thin, flavorless, store bought, pre formed crust.  (And I'm sorry, but if you run a special for a $6 12"" pepperoni pizza and the customer asks for just cheese, why not drop the price a tiny smidge, considering that you aren't having to provide any pepperoni on their pizza?  Almost $23 for a small pizza, two dozen wings and one large Pepsi is kinda high.)

The wings also weren't up to par this visit.  They were badly overcooked, so much so that the drumsticks had all pulled away from the bone and shriveled into little balls of overcooked cooked chicken at the end of the drumstick.  (I can't think of any other way to describe it...)  I like my wings well cooked (like chicken jerky) but last night's wings were just ridiculously overcooked.  They were also woefully skimpy on the sauce, and too boot the butter that makes up the base for my beloved Long Wong's mild wing sauce was kinda off too.  It tasted a tad rancid.  Not enough to make me not eat the wings, but still I could tell it wasn't very fresh like it normally tastes.  It made me pretty sad.

Adding to all that the damn Pepsi wasn't as rich and syrupy and delicious as normal.  This time I could CLEARLY taste the carbonated liquid underneath the Pepsi syrup, and the carbonation was the dominant flavor.  They obviously changed the ratio at the fountain drink dispenser.  (WTF??)

Overall this visit was extremely disappointing.  EXTREMELY.  I am a huge Long Wong's fan, and I live right down the street so I tend to come here a lot, but after last night's visit I am not sure when or if I'll be back...

Long Wong's Management, heed my words.  If a die-hard regular like me is contemplating finding another wing place, you need to take a good, hard look at what you've changed and CHANGE IT BACK.  Whatever penny pinching you did with the pizzas was NO BUENO.  Also, the stinginess on the wing sauce and the Pepsi mixture was not a good move either.  Those were THE things that we loved about your restaurant, and would come and brave the less-than-sparkling-clean conditions at your establishment to enjoy.  If you kill the food quality by skimping on cheese, using some crappy pizza crust, being stingy with wing sauce (ON WINGS!  The VERY THING you are known for!!  DO NOT TAMPER WITH A FAN FAVORITE!) and the syrup mixture on the fountain dispenser then there is almost no way I am braving that frenetic, overcluttered, hot ass mess of dining room restaurant to come back.  Normally I can ignore all that junk on the walls while I savor the delicious food, but now that the food isn't distracting me, I can hardly ignore the random junk dangling from the walls and ceiling.

I am willing to bet you that others will agree here.  You may have saved a little on the ingredients that you just cheaped out on, but it'll cost you a ton in lost repeat business over time.  Penny wise, pound foolish.  Please change it back!",2
Restaurants,"This would be the ideal stop if you were on a scavenger hunt because any and all pop culture trash has been stuck on the wall, shelf or is hanging from the ceiling or parked outside.  OMG, hoarder heaven.
The food was okay yet i ate very skeptically half expecting a cockroach to climb onto the table.  I actually liked the hamburger.  There were wings too but i'm not a fan of those - soaked in enough sauce i'll eat though. There are skinny carrot sticks with thin and runny buttermilk dressing for dip on the side of each wing order.  There were families at the next table with a whiny child and dad yelling at her for most of our meal - how annoying was that.
It appeared there was only one restroom for everyone and we chose not to go there to wash our hands of all the wing grease and sauce.",1
Restaurants,"The place to go for a great, greasy cheeseburger and decent wings. I was most impressed with the quality of the bun on the burger. Very tasty like a brioche. Also, the decor looks very garage sale chic and the exterior is just crazy looking, in a good way. For $6, I thoroughly enjoyed my burger, wings, and drink combo. No, it's not a fancy nouveau premium hamburger place, but if you're looking for one on that part of Thomas Rd, you're possibly a crazy person, or hungover from your Quinceañera.",3
Restaurants,"I always drive by and wonder what kind of food such a crazy looking place can serve.  Stopped in one night craving wings, and just about everything on the menu was screaming to get ordered.
I ended up with a dozen spicy BBQ wings and a side of fried zucchini and mushrooms.  For the price, it really couldn't get any better.  The wings were hot and crunchy, covered in a sweet but spicy BBQ sauce.  The zucchini and mushrooms were fried fresh, so good!
Everything is really affordable and the eclectic decor is fun to look at while you're getting messy with some wings.",4
Restaurants,It is a mixed bag here.  Great sauces (But maybe drowning a bit) fun atmosphere for families or take-out.  No alcohol at this locale.  Wings were good but not great.,3
Restaurants,"Decent for the money, but not spectacular. Wings were overcooked and dry. 

The western bacon burger was decent. Bread was good.",2
Restaurants,"First time I went here I ordered a Long Wong, BIG MISTAKE. The long wong was a hotdog smothered in EZ-CHEESE and tasted like cancer, so I avoided this place for awhile after. Later on I came back to try the wings and damn they were good! Well the suicide wings were, only ones I got. But for 12, they were cheap, LW's didn't skimp on the dip, and they had a good burn to them. Definitely worth the price if you don't feel like cooking and want to go out and get some cheap spicy wings.",4
Restaurants,"Basic hole in the wall greasy fried food.  Really good prices.  Can be a bit slow and can get pretty crowded.  I have only tried their wings and some of their fried items, not the burgers or pizza.  Overall mediocre food, but a pretty good deal if you are feeding a large family or group.",3
Restaurants,Wings were old and dry and gross. Burger was burnt to a crispy and loaded with beyond old lettuce.They forgot the zucchini and mushrooms but im sure they would have been equally gross like everything else. This place is disgusting. If you wouldn't eat this food yourself then don't serve it to your customers.,1
Restaurants,"My first time eating here, I gave chance to try the Wings - BBQ. And I loved it. Finish the Wings with a messy face, and licking my figures off from the BBQ. 
 Definitely would come back if I'm near long Wongs.",5
Restaurants,"I drive by this place every day so my roommate and I decided to finally give the place a shot. Needless to say the best thing about this place is the name (and I guess prices--but remember you get what you pay for!). The wings made me sick, were super greasy, and the hot sauce was just ok. Their fries were super crispy, way too salty, and the food didn't come out at the same time for the whole table. The seats looked and felt disgusting, and I was really disappointed! I wanted to like the place, but I won't ever be going back.",2
Restaurants,"Food....fantastic wings and pretty good pizza.

Ambiance....this place has more character than any restaurant I've ever eaten at. The kids are always mystified and remark about how it feels like being in an I-spy book. That being said, it's not the cleanest place in the world and the unisex restroom, well unless you have an emergency situation going on avoid it. There could be some life forms that have yet to be discovered residing in that restroom.

Staff.....ok

Verdict....If you're in the mood for some delicious wings at a reasonable price, want an interesting environment that will illicit conversation, or have kids this is a great choice.",4
Restaurants,getting some food I wish it was a lot bigger though feel a little crowded. But the wings were delicious the French fries are awesome and the service was fast,4
Restaurants,"""If I could rate this place 0 stars I would""
I have been to the Long Wongs in Tempe, so my boyfriend and I thought of stopping by here, we wanted to watch the championship game and we needed a place quick. We go in wanting some drinks, well the bar was closed...fine, we went and sat at a table a couple feet from a tv, perfect! We asked what draft beers they had and she said they had Bud Light, Coors Light, and Budweiser, so my boyfriend ordered a coors and i got vodka cranberry, she brought over a bottle of coors light and I walked over to the bar and looked at their tap handles and they also had Shocktop and Sierra Nevada on tap as well. Servers clearly do not know what they even have here.
After waiting for about 30 minutes for our appetizer, we finally got it and then 10 minutes later we got our two burgers.
We had no napkins and when we were looking for our server who seemed to be non-existent all night we saw her talking with the manager behind a wall, after staring at them for a few minutes he finally noticed and sent her to come check on us for the first time the whole meal.
Over all just awful service, our server did not know about food or drinks and on top of it could barely communicate with us. 

We were there to watch a game along with two other tables of five guys each who were clearly watching the championship and cheering loudly. After about 15 minutes while trying to figure out why I could barely hear the game I realized they had TV on a news channel right behind the counter, and the server & manager were also playing music from a jukebox on the other side of the restaurant in the ""closed"" bar so loudly I couldn't make out any distinct audio and once we asked why there was music playing she replied ""oh we're listening to music.""

My boyfriend and I both have been working in the industry for years and we are completely understandable of a busy restaurant and things taking a few minutes. There were TWO other tables in there and our server was seen 2 times, our food took forever, and the burgers were not worth it at all. We finally got the check and payed and left, we wrote a small note about how the service was awful (we wanted to talk to the manager but he was too busy trying to get it in clearly) and this is where it gets so much better. We left and saw him walk outside, but we were already on the main street so we called and told him about the situation, he asked us ""Yes, was there a problem?"" We told him about everything, the service, her not being knowledgable of any of her surroundings or her menu, and he replied ""oh...okay"" 

This place is a disaster, they clearly need to make some decisions to get this place turned around or need a complete new management staff, they lost potential regulars and I will tell every single person I can how awful of an experience I had.

DO NOT GO HERE!!!",1
Restaurants,"I have fond memories of Long Wong's from my childhood. My parents were divorced, so my dad pretty much always took me out to dinner on his nights. Long Wong's was a solid part of the rotation, and not just because I only ate cheeseburgers. The place is crazy looking. Literally, the decor looks like it was inspired by an acid trip. Nothing says ""kid friendly"" like a hippopotamus trash can. If you are a single dad who doesn't know how to cook, you should definitely take your kid here for dinner. 

Since it had been at least two decades since I'd been inside a Long Wong's, last night my boyfriend and I decided to check it out. We had a craving for wings (I accidentally typed that I had a crazing for wings, which I'm pretty sure is the exact same thing)  and you can get a bucket of 50 for, like, $25. Going to be honest ... 50 wings might have been a bit overkill for two people. Still, it was worth it. 

We did a split order: 1/2 honey hot and 1/2 medium. The honey hot wings are where it's at. My only complaint is that I like them to be a little crispier. Some of them were slightly soggy. The fries didn't travel well either. In fact, everything was just kind of soggy by the time we got home. The wings were still very good, but I think they will be even better once I give the leftovers a little crisp in the oven. I will say, their homemade ranch was delicious. Can't beat a hot wing dipped into good, homemade ranch. 

I'm definitely going to have to keep this place in mind the next time a wing craving hits ... and maybe ask for them extra crispy.",3
Restaurants,"Today was my birthday and my wifevtook me to this Long Wongs. Long Wongs has always been a favorite place for me to eat. My love for long wongs started as a kid. I would get excited when I knew I was going to get some of their wings. This excitement continues even to this day.

Their is just something about their wings. The sauce is great and instead of baking the wings, they deep-fry them.  Making them that much better, with a crisp out side and a juicy inside. 
And this Long Wongs did not let me down. And officers many new flavors of wings. All just as good.

Today I had the Inferno, parmesan and teriyaki wings. All had been wonderful. My wife like the teriyaki the best. Me, I loved the inferno. They have many other items on their menu however,  I have never had anything, but their wings. So I can not give my opinions on the other items. 

The service I received from the staff here is hit or miss. This is still a fast food joint, so this tends to be expected. People with good customer skills get hired on for more money at other places. While people with bad customer skills tend to get fired so you're always getting new people. So your quality of service is random. 

With all that said, I do find that the person's who are behind decorating this place must be some kind of Hoarders. The outside looks like a juck yeard for things the circus has thrown out. While inside looks like a horder ran out of space at home to keep his, or her junk and just started storing it atbthis Long Wongs. 

It is primarily because of this reason,  why I can't give five stars to a place with the best wings. Eating at a junkyard just is not very appealing at all. 

Pros: Great wings with lots of choices. 

Cons: service quality is random and I feel like I am eating at a junk yeard.",4
Restaurants,"I am happy to report that after some quality hitches that I mentioned in my last review, Long Wong's is back to good!!  

I've been in several times since my last review and each time the pizza and Pepsi were perfect and the wings were amazeballs.  Seems they took note of the issues and corrected them, good on them!

If you haven't had Long Wongs wings then you really should try them.  In my humble opinion they beat all the other wing places, hands down.",5
Restaurants,"Long Wong's is the home to chachkies from decades past, a storefront reminiscent of a tourist destination, jokes of an off-color nature, and really decent cheap food.

I have to disagree with the consensus that this is fantastic food and the best wings in town.  But, it is certainly good and won't break your wallet.  I'm absolutely not complaining.  I just think it was merely ""ok"".  The staff was pretty friendly even though we swarmed their dining room and rearranged their furniture, so that is a plus.

Walking in was overwhelming!  It's a small place with wall-to-wall knick-knacks and paddy-whacks.  You order at the counter, and there is plenty to look at while waiting for your food to come out.  My fella and I ordered a 12-piece BBQ wings with fried zucchini and a large pepsi.  The wings were very good, though they could have been more meaty and flavorful. The zucchini did not impress.  I do not, will not, can not do the spicy thing, so we opted out of ""the inferno"".  That said, I heard rumors that it wasn't that hot, so I stuck my finger in some sauce to try.  It was too hot for me (but hey, so is pepperoni) but I admit it wasn't nearly as hot as I'd expect an inferno might be.  I'd call it a medium/hot.

For a festive evening where I get to cover my face in bbq sauce without judgement, and both Andrew and I leave fed and happy for $12, I'd call it a great success.  I would not say no to a return trip.",3
Restaurants,"five stars for a joint like this? yeah. you have to know what you are getting into, as it wont be everyones cup of tea though. but if you want cheap sandwiches, hot wings, fresh baked deserts and PINBALL this is a great find",5
Restaurants,"This eclectic dive takes ""pieces of flare"" to a whole new level! From the outside-in, it's littered with memorabilia, posters, and toy collections reminiscent of a baby boomer acid trip. After stumbling upon this place a couple years, I went back with much enthusiasm to the UYE: Wing Fest at Long Wongs.

I give the restaurant itself a 5 star rating for uniqueness. It seems to have pretty deep roots in the community, as lots of families poured in on a Friday night. Many came for the take-out. The parking lot outside is not very big, so it can be a tad hectic with folks coming and going. Near the front door, I think we saw someone selling jewelry. Not creepy ""van guy"" jewelry, but a nice lady with her kids interacting with customers. It is not your usual scene here, and I liked that.

I WISH I could have given the food more stars. But, frankly, the wings were lacking in meat. The BBQ sauce we got was ok. I did like the inferno flavor (it was more like a medium/hot level of heat). The wings themselves were mostly bone and gristle, and without amazing flavor to supplement, weren't up to par with other valley wing spots. We also ordered the deep fried zucchini, which I rather liked. But hey, I'm a sucker for deep fried *anything*. Also, the Pepsi is free refills, so that was a plus.

I do recommend you grabbing a few friends to check the place out. It's a neat restaurant and the food won't disappoint you. Just don't go in with too high of expectations.",3
Restaurants,"I love hot wings. It's a weird food. I mean, think about it for a second. You can't make them at home. Ok someone is reading this right now mumbling duhh ya you can duhhhh. Listen A hole, yes you can but its just not worth all the steps ok?  Besides they're just not gonna be as good so shut up. Shut it. 
 
Since Teakwoods moved from 28th st & Indian School I've been without a wing joint. Eating 2nd rate wings is depressing. Just thinking back to last month when I was munching on a breaded hot wing from Domino's puts me on suicide watch. It's like handing a strung out crackhead a freagin antihistamine. Speakin of crackheads, remember that episode of Saved By the Bell when Jesse was poppin all them pills singing that one song?   

I haven't been to Long Wong's in a few years primarily because the last few times I went there...I was not impressed. Well the other day a friend at work brought in some wings. Me, being a crackhead for these things I tried them out & asked where they were from. You guessed it.

So tonight I ordered a dozen hot. No zucchini, no mushrooms, no pizza - just some wings. The total came out to close to 8 bucks with an extra ranch. I came home to watch the ballgame & really enjoyed them. They were the only pleasant suprise tonight as the Dbacks got their asses handed to them once more.

They come a little bit on the wet side, which I think works. I would give the sauce a solid 8 out of 10. They cook them perfectly, done all the thru. They must have made some changes since I last been here because I don't ever remember the wings being on this level. Props to you guys.

I'll go back once I need another fix. Perhaps ill try one of there other sauces? One suggestion I would make to the Long Wong familia is maybe offer grilled hot wings to char up some of that sauce. Till then ill be alright with my normal crack. Maybe I'll get really wild, order TWO dozen, go on a naked rampage & eat some poor man's face. Then again...the dozen should probably do. See ya around Wong.",4
Restaurants,"If you're going here for the wings, you will not be disappointed, and I am VERY PICKY about my wings. I really only eat here and at Native New Yorker because their wings are crispy instead of soggy, without nasty bread crumbing or coatings of any sort, just wings and sauce.

But sadly, everything else is kind of mediocre. Then again, why go to a wing place for fries or a burger?

Also, the decor is hideous in the best kinds of ways. It has a creepy charm to it, I love that about this location!",4
Restaurants,"If you love going to dives with great food, eclectic decor, and great prices, this place is a must. By food I mean hot wings. The wings here are excellent. The fries were average but the quality of the wings make up for any drawbacks. I wish Long Wongs expanded to LA. On second thought maybe not because I would be in trouble. If your looking for your hot wing fix in Phoenix, look no further.",5
Restaurants,"I've been going to this place for years and I've gotten tried of their amazing WINGS! They have other great food hear, such as their cheesy potato wedges, but their wings are the main item hear and the prices are great. I do see a few people complain from time to time, so let me put it like this. If you're the type of person that needs their food cooked a specific way or expects it a certain way instead of just try it and judging it how it is, then you're going to be disappointed not only with this place but several others.",5
Restaurants,Just had wings from there since people really seemed to recommend them. I gotta say they certainly met those expectations. They where so jucy and delicious I had to take some home!! The only thing I would change is the dining area. Seems really small and awkward but love the decor. I will continue to buy and recommend this place to all my friends and family.,4
Restaurants,For the most part it's a unique and different place from the rest. From the old pin ball Machine to the flamed painted Cadillac parked outside. The fries suck but I love the crunchy wings with a side Bucket of hot sauce.,4
Restaurants,The wings here are amazing. Other menu items like onion rings or fried mushrooms... not so amazing. This place has character. You feel like you need a tetanus shot after you leave. The staff are friendly and most likely prison parolees. Get your order to go and you'll be happy. There be strange people that frequent this place.,3
Restaurants,"This place has to be one of the worst places I have ever eaten at. It makes me angry that it has the positive reviews it has. I merely ate here because of the good reviews. I love wings and I'm always looking for new places to try. When I walked in, I was not impressed, it was very cluttered but I kept an open mind..I wasn't there for the view..I was there for the food. When I received my dozen wings,they came out on a Styrofoam 5-part throw away plate. The entire bottom was covered in oil and grease. The wings were fried past the point of being able to salvage any meat off of them. I couldn't even taste the sauce.. All I could taste was grease. I could only stomach eating 4 out of the 12. I ate two wings and two legs hoping i had a few bad ones... But I could clearly see by looking at them the whole order was uneatable. I thought about complaining, but it just wasn't worth my time or energy. I was completely shocked this'd place was busy and has the reviews it has. If you don't care how your food tastes, then I say this is the place for you, it's affordable and the staff is nice. But if your like me and have some standard to your food order... stay away from here, don't even waste your time or $7.00. It's a dump in more ways then one. I didn't even want to give it a star.",1
Restaurants,"Best in Az! Suciadal- Infierno wings extra grill , extra sauce all over only pallets . The best. Highly recommend if  you like spicy food.",5
Restaurants,You dont come to long wongs because your new years resolution is to lose weight. You come here for cheap greasy down home unapologetic assault to your arteries food.,4
Restaurants,"Show up for the decor, stay for the wings.",4
Restaurants,"Looking for the best deal, this is the place to go! I tried the garlic parmesan wings Amazing. This is my new favorite flavor. My son got the Bbq very good, the flavors are on point, service is quick. Absolutely will be going again, best wings ever and great price!!! $$$$",5
Restaurants,"I stick with what works for me.
This location and the same meal is why I love Long Wongs.
The customer service is always amazing. The same employees have been here since I was a kid ( long time ago ;)

Try the burger,4 wing combo, very filling. My little picky eater loves the pizza.",5
Restaurants,"Been going to the 28st location for 25 years and have never had s bad meal. They gave THE BEST patty melt in town served New York style .... Awesome! Also, it's hard to find a better charbroiled chicken salad . Great food and even better prices... Best hole in the wall in Phoenix by far!",5
Restaurants,Love the food especially the wings they were crispy not dried out i will be back again,5
Restaurants,Been goin here for years an the only thing I can say is yummy yummy yum the menu is huge they got what you have a taste for ! Trust me this is noble plan wing spot. Very colorful and has a lot of history and cool item inside! Definitely a place to recommend!,5
Restaurants,"One of my favorite spots, great wings, fun atmosphere. Almost always see some good friends here too!",4
Restaurants,It would have been a 1 stars if it wasn't for the owner(?) who was kind enough to actually check to see if something they served had the item I was allergic to. The Rueben was 'ok' at best and they somehow assumed I would not be staying at the restaurant since I came to eat by myself (since when does being single mean you HAVE to eat at home alone?!?!?!) Might be a cultural thing but seriously...,2
Restaurants,"Burgers, wings, pizza, fries with cheese.....all DELICIOUS !  The variety and customer service is outstanding.  Everything I have had there is like heaven when it touches my lips.  One of my favorite places to eat in the valley.",5
Restaurants,"I first had Long Wong's in the middle of a 28 hour shift.  I was starving, it was somewhere around 10 pm, I'd missed dinner, and the hospital cafeteria wasn't going to be open for two more hours.  Luckily I had some family members in town who brought me a burger from Long Wong's.  I devoured that thing and it tasted just like those $15 upscale burgers across town.  I had no clue where it had come from.

Since then, I've actually been to Long Wong's restaurant.  I was completely in shock when I walked in - the outside building and interior didn't match up at all with what I had imagined.  It's super kitschy, with old-school video games lining the walls alongside that talking Mr. Fish that my grandpa has.  It's definitely not a date interior - pretty sure this must be a popular hangout for high school kids and anyone else stoned out of their mind - but the food really hits the spot when you're in a burger mood.  Much better than those big name fast food restaurants and much cheaper than those big name slow food restaurants.

All in all, I'm a fan and Long Wong's remains on my go-to list of unhealthy treats.",4
Restaurants,"Food was okay, nothing amazing in my opinion but absolutely satisfying! Cashier was friendly and had neat old timer games in the back. Also, great variety of food. The burger was just as good as the pizza and wings! I wouldn't mind going back.",3
Restaurants,"The place is a pit and it always has been a pit. Poor service rounds it off to a nice one star. After years of hesitating to go back to this place that I remembered was so bad , I tried it once again the  other day and, I had to walk out once again. I will never be back.",1
Restaurants,Buen lugar SUPER local! Muy original la decoración y la.comida buena si piden alitas lemon pepper pidan doble seasoning para que sepa realmente la atención increíble y la gente SUPER cercana,5
Restaurants,"I don't get what the hype is about.  Their wings weren't good at all.  Their burger combos are very inexpensive, and honestly do okay in a pinch and on a budget, but you get what you pay for.  Nothing to write home about.",2
Restaurants,Long wongs never fails! Whenever I'm hungry I like to stop by this locally owned place for the wings and burgers they are very good!!! Will always continue to come here! They never disappoint !,5
Restaurants,"Friendliest staff, no matter how swamped they are. Always smiling and gracious. Garlic parm and lemon pepper wings. Mmmmmmmm.

Love the simplicity of the place and the trinkets all over the walls, always discover something new.",5
Restaurants,"The Pros:
Food came out FAST
LOTS of food, and cheap too!

The Cons:
Everything that came out of the kitchen was premanufactured. Frozen fries, frozen wings, canned chili, canned cheese sauce. Wings were frozen and precooked so when they were cooked again for our order they were overdone. 

After many many years of driving by this building I finally came in. Not underwhelmed because my expectations were in the right place. If yours are, you will not be underwhelmed either. It's basically bar food but without the bar. Not the worst I've ever had by any stretch, but never a place I'd circle a date on the calendar for. I'd come back simply for the volume of food and price point.",2
Restaurants,Decided to stop in and check out this wild building. It's awesome and odd and the food tastes great. We will be back for sure.,5
Restaurants,"Been going to this place for years. It's cheap, delicious and consistent. It's a guilty pleasure for sure. This place needs to be ranked higher it's the best Long Wongs to share the name in the Valley.",5
Restaurants,"Wings? Good lawd
Burgers? Serviceable
Pizza? Good goes with the wings
Decor? I love their style
Specials? They anyways have them, and they are always random. (That's a good thing)
Entertainment? Bring your quarters boiz, they have old school arcade games!
If your looking for 5 stars fancy food, go else where. This is a legit pizza and wings joint with excellent food.",5
Restaurants,"I normally get the steak Carne Asada Taco's and let me tell you they ROCK!!! You get a plate of three tacos with some chips, beans or rice and  with a drink for about $5-6 bucks. Great stomach filler for cheap. And hey pop a few coins into the jukebox while you wait for some interesting looks haha ;)",4
Restaurants,"Taco Trio of beef pork and chicken, rice and beans. 

Man that was some good grub. I preferred the pork. 

Try it.",4
Restaurants,"Pretty blah, really.  

It's fast food but with sit down prices and barely fast food taste.

The taco platter Jesse mentioned, is three street tacos on a styrofoam plate which has other little compartments filled with a a few spoonfuls of rice, beans, avocado sauce, and chopped lettuce.  They sprinkle a handful of chips over the top.

The meat isn't char grilled, but steamed on a flat-top and is greasy/wet enough that the little tortillas break apart before you get halfway through the first one.  I ended up dumping the mix into a pile, tossing the tortillas, and eating it like cereal.  

Not horrible, but also not worth the price.  The combos are $6.75 and drinks are extra ($2). so for $9 you get a pretty weak meal compared with other good/cheap Mexican places or decent sit down joints with service.",2
Restaurants,"This place has decent prices and good tacos.  I get the 3 taco meal.  I think the pork is awesome.  Tacos come on corn enchilada shells (a plus in my book) and are served with refried beans and rice.  

They offer a choice of green or red salsa.  I had the red it was mild/mediumish  in strength.  Tacos are served with salsa and onions with lettuce and tomato given in a bed underneath.  

Great food - Very filling.

I would recommend trying it if in the area!

A-OK grub.",3
Restaurants,": (
Hubby was craving Carl's burger and we were in this neighborhood, so we ended up here...
A few odd things...
Hubby had the Western burger and I had the bacon guacamole $6 dll burger... Staff was friendly, food was OK. Mine had a strong flavor, like cumin (I guess I do not like cumin very much) but I didn't know if it came from the guacamole or something else.

My sweet potato fries (large) were like half. While the container was flat on the tray it looked full, but once I picked it up... I swear, it was almost half...
Hubby had the criss cross ones and that was reasonably full, but the odd thing is that he asked for large but the receipt said medium.
Straws? They only had short straws by the fountain drinks, which barely stick out of the large cups, like a cm or less... I went and asked if they had long straws and they immediately gave me a couple from behind the counter... o.O

Like some other yelper mentioned, the tables, seats and floor look like greasy... 

Aaaaand, to top it off, my hubby noticed a bug behind me... and it looked to me like a tiny roach (like 2mm).... : ( those brown ones with a yellow spot...

Yuck... please remind me not to stop here ever again... : (",1
Restaurants,"Normally carls jr has some of the better fast food burgers around but this visit was quite different.  I only live 4 minutes away but when I got home the burger was almost cold.  I ordered a double and got a single, and the patty was super dry and quite tasteless.  The fresh baked bun was the best thing about the burger.",2
Restaurants,"This place SUCKS! My fiance asked for extra packets to go with our meal, the guy wasn't too thrilled with doing so. 
Their drinks were flat.
Our burgers were thrown together and sloppy.",1
Restaurants,"HAPPY CINCO DE MAYO!

Here is where I celebrated my Cinco.  With 5 rolled tacos, how could you go wrong?  The 5 beauties were lined up in a row with quacamole, cheese and shredded lettuce all plopped on top, it was delish!

Not that any of these place  can boast cleanliness, neither can this place BUT- you get it to go.  Eat it at home and you are A-OK.",4
Restaurants,"Not a fan at all. I was looking for a late night Taco stop that would surprise me, in a good way.  The food (Taco and enchilada) had a funky taste, slightly chemical. I threw it out after a few bites. Scottsdale rules for Mexican. You would have to be wasted to think this place was a gem.",1
Restaurants,"Pros: good food (the best Churros, I, have tasted, OK service, mostly clean restaurant (and by clean, they are practically sloshing bleach across the floor every time I go there) and they also have a pinball machine/claw machines for when your bored while waiting a long time for your food.

Cons: the Clorox smell in the restaurant is really strong, and having a picture of the world trade centers up in a Mexican restaurant is untasteful. Although most of the food is fresh, the wait time for a small order is really long whether you are inside or through the drive thru.  They are no longer 24hrs so when you randomly get hungry at 3am like me, their extremely convenient location is crossed off the list of possible options of places to go.",3
Restaurants,"I'm not really sure if this is the right ROLBERTO'S that we ate at but it was really really good so if they are a chain and all related you really can't go wrong. It was funny because I really like a place called ROBERTO'S  and one of our friends we were with was a local and she said oh we have ROBERTO'S here and I was sold right then and there, and then when we pulled up I said ""hey this isn't ROBERTO'S it's ROLBERTO'S""  this was entirely too funny to us and I hope you can appreciate the humor. 
The story aside the food delivered and we enjoyed it!",4
Restaurants,"When I lived in North Phx I went here  ALOT , its Cash only but open 24 hours- fabulous burritos and tacos when you have the munchies any time of day. I love their California burrito with a large Horchata nomnomnom",5
Restaurants,"By far the best taco shop in the valley. Their rolled tacos are delicious. I've had them dozens of time and they never disappoint. The restaurant is older and what you'd expect of a normal ""taco shop"", but it is very clean and the staff is always very friendly. They also have the best red hot sauce I've tasted yet. Yuuuuuuum.",5
Restaurants,"Very good taco shop. Carne asada is awesome and so is chicken.this is real mexican taco shop stuff.  If you like Taco Bell stay away, if you like the real deal go here.  Get yourself a carne asada burrito and you will not be sorry.",4
Restaurants,"I was in the area getting a wheel alignment done so I went for a stroll to find a place to eat. Came across Rolberto's so I stopped in. Its a typical roadside taco shop so I wasn't expecting too much. I ordered a breakfast burrito. The thing was huge and full of egg, cheese, and bacon (my meat choice). It was tasty and filling to say the least.",3
Restaurants,"I work next door...
I enjoy Rolberto's for my typical Cheese Enchiladas dish...
But that is nothing that requires work.

Cheese not always fully melted :(
But restaurant always clean in dining area & staff always friendly.",2
Restaurants,"You don't want to eat here, just hit the drive thru...rockin burritos de carne asada",4
Restaurants,Been coming here since I was a kid. One of the best taco shops around.,5
Restaurants,The food is always good. The California burrito is by far the best and I love their rolled tacos covered in guacamole and sour cream. The inside is always very clean. Don't let the worn out sign deter you the food is amazing and don't forget their hot sauce. They also finally accept credit cards for a 30 cent fee.,5
Restaurants,"Absolutely the best!!! I have been going here for the past twelve years and I would guesstimate that I've eaten more than 1000 chicken burritos from this place. 
Always clean inside, the food is always fresh.  I have know people that have gotten sick (food poisoning) from other taco shops like this, but in twelve years I have never heard of anyone getting sick from Rolbertos at Cave Creek & Sweetwater.",5
Restaurants,One of the better 'tos i have been to in the valley. Sausage burrito was great. Service very friendly. Will try again.,4
Restaurants,Delicious food!  Love this place!  I use the drive through.  The chimichangas are great.  I also love the deep fried beef tacos.  Fast service.  Affordable for a family of 5. Looks like a hole in the wall but the food is as good as a sit down restaurant!,5
Restaurants,"So, this place may look scary, but it's so delicious! I may be biased (I've been eating here for over 14 years!) but it's one of my three ""go-to"" Mexican spots. My normal dish is the four rolled taco special and I just LOVE it! Take your taquito, dip it in the beans, dip it in the rice, dunk it into your salsa of choice and, YUM. I've also had their super nachos, super fries, breakfast burritos, and horchata. All lovely and tasty, and I've never had a bad experience. Try them!",5
Restaurants,"I come here a lot for breakfast. Forget Taco Bell! This is where it's at (at least for breakfast.) The burritos are filled with meat/eggs. I almost want to ask for less meat and cheese and replace a little with some beans but I don't want them thinking I don't like the food. It's just a ton of meat (and cheese)...and I'm really not complaining. 

I've never been inside. So glad they have a drive through. I am downgrading because they don't always respond to their drive thru customers. I'm not sure if the mechanism just doesn't work but it's really not very consistent. I sometimes just leave because I don't want to go inside.  It's not 'fast food' at all.  You do have to wait a bit and It's always hot and fresh...WHEN I can get it.",3
Restaurants,"Literally no competition. Rolled tacos are awesome, California burritos are to die for...with shoes string fries as the potatoes, and the breakfast burritos with eggs, bacon, and cheese (add potatoes)....are the BEST. Don't judge a book by its cover, as you will miss out. Family owned.",5
Restaurants,This place has the absolute best bean and cheese burrito the mixture is amazing it is it!,5
Restaurants,"Great true Mexican food! Go through the drive food and they will have your food out quick! I recommend their California burrito or their ham,eggs, and cheese breakfast burrito!",5
Restaurants,"Spicy and Extra Crispy

Looking for Cajun style fried chicken.  Staff are friendly.  I had to wait extra long for my order one time, but manager apologized and gave extra chicken pieces and biscuits.  Opt for the extra crispy and spicy chicken.",3
Restaurants,"When I was a kid, my dad used to fry bologna for dinner. 
I hated it. 
It was so greasy, it left a film in my mouth...as if my tongue was coated with some sort of lard.
Well if you like this sort of thing, I highly recommend going to Church's. 

I ate there last week. Afterward, one of the women in my office asked if I lost a bet.
When I pressed, asking why she'd say something like that,  she responded;

 ""I noticed you had lip gloss on.""",1
Restaurants,The only things I have tried here are the chicken strips and the okra. Chicken was good. Okra is better at Cracker Barrel.,4
Restaurants,"The chicken is good, the strips are nice and fresh, but the mac & cheese is just awful.  They started offering a ""baked"" mac&cheese, but it's really just the same crap with a little shredded cheese put in.  They make you ask for tea that if only available behind the counter.  That's not a big deal if it's not busy.  When it is busy, expect to wait and it feels like your bothering them.  I tried the new fish filets as well and lets just say you might want to pass.  This place isn't the cleanest place in the world but the standard chicken is good and not as greasy as say KFC.  The people there have always been very nice and helpful.

*Update* 06-04-2013 :  The so called Texas Chicken was nothing like the advertisement and was just a non-breaded fried half chicken dusted with spices. It was so dry and was something I would never want to get again.  The ads looked so good too.",2
Restaurants,"You truly can never go wrong with Church's Fried Chicken.  Is it healthy? Nope, but man, is it good.  Their flavor for the chicken is just so consistent every time and so tasty.  Their mashed potatoes are also great along with the fried okra.  The corn has always been bad every time we buy it...it always looks so good, but every time, it's bland and soggy.  There is a girl that works there that is quite obnoxious.  She's loud, talks to herself, and talks randomly to people with the strangest remarks.  Though she's happy...you can clearly tell her co-workers can't stand her.  Poor girl.  Anyway, for the few times we get CFC, it beats out any other fried chicken place such as KFC or Popeye's.",4
Restaurants,"25 years ago I tried Churches, and didn't like it then. Tried it Friday, yuk, same fatty-greasy-over cooked chicken . Other yelpers right, mac & cheese is play-dough like in nature.  Mashed potatoes & gravy in one container?? Your mom didn't serve it that way, so where'd you learn it? The only thing good was the corn on the cob! Tender juicy-excellent!  KFC May be out of your neighborhood & a little bit more $$, but it's worth the drive.",1
Restaurants,This location sucks. They messed up my order twice in one night and didn't even offer to compensate me. Never going back.,1
Restaurants,"I saw this Church's Fried Chicken place while filling up with gas at 32nd street.  I couldn't help but try them as I was a Church's Fried Chicken virgin.  My mother used to eat it ALL THE TIME in upper Manhattan in New York City where she ran a store.  I guess it was a quick, cheap lunch, but it had to be more than that as my mother was a good cook who knew how to make good chicken herself.  I walked in for the $2.99 order which seemed cool (two pieces of chicken, one side and one biscuit), but after all was said and done I upgraded to an additional side and an additional biscuit--still a good value for the money.  
Got home with my chicken in tow, thinking of mom all the way since I was carrying her favorite meal. Wondering if I would like it.  
My two pieces of chicken were ample, crispy and not as greasy as I expected.  I have had chicken that begins with a ""K""  and found it to be greasy around these parts so I was pleasantly surprised with how un-greasy it was.  The biscuits were soft like biscuits should be (not hockey-pucks).  However, they put some type of sweet glaze on it that I would have omitted.  I like my biscuits like biscuits--they are not dessert --they are supposed to complement the chicken.  I would have left that glaze off.  Would I eat them again.  Yup.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were good.  Glad I upgraded to an extra side so now I have one in the fridge waiting for me to dig into it.   So there you have it.  Good chicken, good mashed potatoes and a pretty good biscuit.  Yelpers are complaining about the mac and cheese here.  SO DON'T GET IT. Few places make real good mac and cheese.  And some restaurants feel that they have to add four cheeses to the Mac and Cheese to make it good.  NO, NO, NO, NO.  Use sharp cheddar and make a béchamel sauce, etc etc.  (can't give you my whole recipe or you will make mac and cheese as well as I do.  NO CAN DO. I want to remain the Queen of Mac & Cheese in my family!!)   Now you know the real deal---it's the mashed potatoes you should go for when you go to a Church's Chicken.  So despite the complaints by some Yelpers, the ""Boss Lady"" came, bought and ate Church's Chicken and liked it.  There you have it.",4
Restaurants,"I stopped eating KFC after getting mild food poisoning from it the last 2 times, and there aren't a whole lot of options for fried chicken in North Phoenix, so I decided to make the 20 minute drive to this Church's, which has been at this location for at least 30 years (I believe). When the girl told me it would be about a 10 minute wait for chicken, I did not mind at all. They make fresh small batches, so waiting is good in this case. The chicken was nice and crunchy (I wish they seasoned it closer to KFC, but oh well). Mac and Cheese was very good, and their honey-butter biscuits are amazing. There were three people working and seemed to be mostly professional and efficient. One girl however, didn't acknowledge a customer that had just walked in. He stood there for several minutes and she ignored him until he said something to her. I don't care if you're busy, it is the easiest thing in the world to say, ""Hi, I'll be with you in a moment. "" Seriously, use your head!",4
Restaurants,"I have been here twice now and the first time i asked for no pickles i still ended up with them on my sandwich, after making them aware they then handed me a sandwich with the pickles taken off by hand. Now on my second go round i ordered the same things only to be given a chicken sandwhich with a processed chicken patty they see of my palm which is not very big... overall disappointed with there service and the food has really gone down hill. DONT GO HERE",1
Restaurants,"I like this place. The chicken is decent....not too greasy. It's much better than KFC. I am not a huge fan of chicken with bones (I'm weird that way) so I always get the chicken tenders and they are pretty decent. Especially with their honey mustard sauce. I prefer a side of potatoes and gravy over the French fries. The biscuits are yummy of you get them hot and fresh.
It's fast food but it's decent fast food.
The service here is also pretty good. I try not to go inside fast food locations so I don't get freaked out by what I see and end up going hungry so I can't speak for the cleanliness of the location.",4
Restaurants,"Churches has improved somewhat from my previous several visits when the chicken was overcooked and dry. I'm afraid that is the new standard in chicken cooking - well, well, well done & leave it under the 208V warming lights until it is leathery under the breading. I asked them to give me a double order fresh from the fryer and therefore possibly not over cooked. The resulting order was ""OK"" but nothing to write home about. It's a real shame. Churches used to consistently serve really outstanding fried chicken. Oh well . . .",3
Restaurants,"Sometimes you just get a hankerin' for tasty bizkits and this is where to come to scratch that itch!  Oh yeah,  they have pretty darn good crispy chicken too!",3
Restaurants,"OK place to grab a quick lunch - bought the 2 piece lunch special - comes with 2 sides, a biscuit, and a jalapeño

Got a leg and thigh and mashed potatoes/gravy and cole slaw, a biscuit, but no jalapeño.

Chicken was decent, and hard to wreck mashed potatoes and gravy.  Cole slaw was pretty good also.  Biscuit was kind of hard, but tasted pretty good.  

The (missing) jalapeño really didn't have much flavor...",3
Restaurants,"Generally, Church's is not a place to expect much but it's at least adequate.  My order started off with a broken ordering speaker.  Once I received my order I had to turn around and head back because my sides were wrong.  This was the first time I had actually been inside this store and it stinks like rancid grease.  The staff is apologetic and corrects my order so I leave happy enough.  I then have to return again once I open the giant box of chicken strips, only to find the small, cold hard strips of chicken huddling in one forth of the oversized box.  Once again, I return to the grease pit to have chicken over explained to me by a lady I can only assume was in charge.  Her lack of name tag made it impossible to know who she was, but she was the loudest, rudest person in the shop.  After having a good 45 minutes of my day wasted I left with hot, properly sized chicken.  This place is a relic and needs to be shut down.",1
Public Services & Government,"Had the most positive experience in a government building when I visited to get my social security card. I literally walked in, checked in with the security guard, she gave me my ticket, checked my bag for weapons, and I sat down for literally 4minutes and was called up to a window. 

It was about noon when I visited on a Friday to get my Social Security Card, and the representative was super pleasant and helpful. I strongly suggest if you don't want to deal with parking issues with the downtown location, come here!",5
Public Services & Government,If you're coming for a new or replacement social security card you need to go to Suite B NOT the main office. When you pull into the parking lot turn left and follow the road around. Suite B is located in the back left side of the building. The security guard will search your belonings so leave your guns and drugs at home. The staff was very friendly and I was in and out in about 45 minutes. If your changing your name like I was you will have to wait 48 hours before you to go to the MVD to get an updated licence to allow their system to process the change. I was told I'll receive my new card in the mail in 2 weeks.,4
Public Services & Government,"2.. the number of hours I spent here getting my new social security card with my new last name. 7. the number of minutes it took, once my name was called to get a new SS card ordered for me in said last name. I pray that I never have to come back to this place again after that crazy experience. Plus it was FREEZING! What the crap?",1
Public Services & Government,"As other reviews have said if you are looking to change your name Suite B is around the corner from the main entrance so park / walk in on that side. Both entrances have a security guard that will ask why you are there and will ensure that you get checked in. If you have a bag or purse, they will ask to check it for any weapons and then request that you put your cell phone on silent or vibrate.

I didn't have an appointment, but since we recently got married, I needed to request a new SS card in order to get my name updated. I received a ticket from the security guard that checked me in and I was about 4 numbers off from the most recently called one. I waited about five minutes in a chair before my number was called (side note: if you go at lunch time, they will have less windows open - so if you can, try going during the earlier morning, or a bit after lunch to ensure you get seen).  

Be sure to check their website before going so you can print and fill out the application form and have it ready to go.  It's also a great resource for being able to know what to bring with you so you don't have to make a return trip.  

I had my passport, birth certificate, driver's license and marriage license. It took about five minutes for the clerk behind the counter to type in all my information and I was ready to go!  She was fast, efficient and friendly.  The security guard was helpful and funny. 

Overall: A
Check the website, come prepared, and all in all it should be a quick visit!!",4
Public Services & Government,"Almost 5 years into marriage and I decided it was time to finally legally change my name...

Part of the reason that it took me so long was the dreaded process of going to the Social Security Administration office amongst a handful of others.  But I bit the bullet and took step number one which landed me here.

I walked into the wrong entrance and was quickly told I needed to enter on the other side of the building.  No big deal... As I walked, I crossed my fingers that the line wouldn't be as long as the first side.  And when I entered over there, it didn't look too bad.  I think I waited approximately one hour and then met with my ""agent"" for about five minutes to take care of my own paperwork.

Step one of the name change taken care of... hooray!
Only about 6 other steps to go (before hitting up credit card, bank, airlines, etc...) Wish me luck!

A few things to note if you are heading to this office:
There are no drinks allowed, no computers allowed, and your phone must be kept on silent.  You may also want to call ahead to check their hours as they close early on certain days of the week.  Good luck!",3
Public Services & Government,"Wow, wow, wow! I came here for the sole purpose of changing my last name due to marriage. I came at 1:20 on Friday and left at 1:45. Quick right?! Everything was wonderful and extremely easy. I came in the suite B doors as mentioned in the other reviews. Only took 15 minutes of waiting about 5 for the actually go through the paperwork. 

Well right when I was stepping inside my car, I realized that the guy messed up my address so here I am waiting at the end of the line again. Real dumb. Good job. Once again, the government did it!  So for that sole purpose, 3 stars only. Incompetent fools.

I recommend coming later around closing time cause no one is really there especially on Friday. Also I brought in my passport and other IDs. They don't really need much. They will just ask you a few questions.",3
Public Services & Government,"Pretty clean facility. Fast and prompt service. Very friendly staff. I just got married and needed to change my last name on my social security card. I was in and out of the office in less than 5 minutes, granted it was a Wednesday at 11:30am. I was dreading coming here and was so relived as to how fast it went. Definitely come to this office.",5
Public Services & Government,"People who works there need to be more happier and have smile on their face.  Overall services were quick, however there aren't enough parking spots, you may need to park somewhere else and walk over.",3
Public Services & Government,"It's an office of the Federal Government.  That means you can expect to wait longer that you should and have less than friendly service.  Thankfully, this visit wasn't to bad, other than the fact I had to ditch my coffee as they don't allow you to bring any liquids into the building.  It would be better if they at least had a coffee machine inside, but they don't so I suffered, I'm just glad I didn't have to wait to long.",3
Public Services & Government,"If you're looking for name changes/corrections make sure to read the signs that say Suite B! It literally is right around the corner.

I was extremely impressed! It took me only about 5 minutes to get done what I needed & there was almost no wait time.

I was skeptical since I always hear people complain about what a long process it is getting your name changed, but it was quick & easy in my opinion.

Make sure to visit ssa.gov prior to your visit to make sure you have the appropriate documentation to do whatever it is you need to do.

Theres also plenty of parking, but like I said, just know what side of the building you need to beat the heat!",4
Public Services & Government,"I thought it would be a long wait. I went two years ago and waited a few minutes outside then a couple hours inside before being helped. Today I had to go again to update my status from resident to citizen. I got there at 8:30am (Friday) and waited outside in a long line. At 8:55 they started letting people in. I finally got inside just after 9am. I just sat down when a lady directed me to an open window. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes. For the wait outside, bring a folding chair and something cold to drink, the rest is easy and quick!! From the security guard outside, to the guard inside checking bags, the lady directing people and the lady helping me - they were all very friendly and helpful.",5
Public Services & Government,In and out in 10 minutes flat (On a Monday at 10AM). Took me longer to drive there. Needed a new card. The security guard was friendly (and adorable!) and the agent who assisted me (Gloria) was just the sweetest!,5
Public Services & Government,I didn't even make it into the door into sweet b. The Security guard was highly disrespectful. I decided to go to the south Phoenix location instead. I would rather wait longer than deal with that so early in the morning.,1
Public Services & Government,"What a terrible experience.  This is the government at its finest.  I needed replacement social security cards for my kids and I researched everything I needed online, including their hours of operation.  The first time I went they were closed (different hours).  The second time I was told I needed different paperwork, so I went home and collected everything I was told.  The third time I was again told I needed different paperwork and to bring the kids with me.  The fourth time everything was finally processed - it only took an hour.  This was an hour once I got to a window, this does not include the wait time when you first arrive.",1
Public Services & Government,"If you're going to have to do anything social security related, come here. Quick. Easy and Friendly. Best of all, you're not shoulder to shoulder with a bunch of people. I got in at about 9:20am and was out by 9:40am. Only if every government service was this easy.",4
Public Services & Government,"Wonderful easy experience! Showed up a little before they opened, waited in a short line and got seen within 30 minutes. The security guard was super nice and so was the lady that checked me in. Granted I was here for a name change, but either way I didn't mind the experience!",5
Restaurants,The food was just okay. Super greasy from the lard in the beans and meat was not of good quality. The tortillas they used were very good though. But because if the grease pouring out of my burrito I couldn't eat it.,2
Restaurants,"Nothing really blows your socks off here for it being mexican food. It is good, and it hits the spot. Definitely a better alternative than the los betos and filibertos because its the same price but way better food.

Not top quality. I like the place though.

The respados here suck though, so steer clear.  Tortas are good and their version of a papusa (i forget what they call it here, gordos or something that is taco bell reminiscent) are my top recommendations",3
Restaurants,"I've been coming here for years with my family and we have never had a bad experience. The family is attentive, the place is kind of small but the salsas are just like the ones coming out of my nanas house (I'm first generation here in America). The chili rellenos are a must try! Try to play around with the salsas on the chili rellenos to add extra flavor. Also... The caldo de rez is incredible. We honestly would pick this restaurant for our authentic over any other around the neighborhood hands down.... And it helps that their prices are reasonable.",5
Public Services & Government,"3.5 stars

Finally got to visit this city of Phoenix, when all the other times we both would only be in the city because of the airport. Our friend took us to Phoenix to grab brunch before our trip back and pretty much drove us around Downtown Phoenix. It pretty much reminds me of Downtown Los Angeles. A few ghetto places and a few nice places. I thought there wouldn't be homeless people, but I guess I was wrong. There's always going to be at least 1% of them here and there. 

There's a few one way streets, so be careful when you're driving. ALSO be careful with drivers, some may look like tourist and will not look at traffic while busy looking at something else. 

Drove passed Downtown Civic Space Park - http://www.yelp.com/biz/downtown-civic-space-park-phoenix

Looked pretty cool. Try coming here at night time, the lit up loop will most likely amaze you like it would with me even when it wasn't even lit in colors :D I just can't wait to check it out the next time I visit!",3
Public Services & Government,"Phoenix is a one of a kind city, that is beautiful, fashionable, BIG, and luxurious. :-)",5
Public Services & Government,"I adore this city and would move here in a heartbeat. It is a foodie's dream, hiking is fabulous, Spring Training is fun even for the non-baseball inspired and the views are breathtaking.",5
Restaurants,they gave me cold mac and cheese.,1
Restaurants,I always get coupons from them and it always bring me back to buy their chicken and the price are also good too. But they don't have a drive-thru like the one on baseline and I'm just being lazy..,4
Restaurants,Fresh Food is important to me I am extremely picky ! My chicken was fresh hot and juicy !,5
Restaurants,"Let me sum it up: Food is horrible, mac and cheese was runny, poor service , got a medium mac and cheese I opened it it was basically a small.",1
Restaurants,Worst service ever. Don't know the menu and takes forever. Go to Popeyes down the road.,1
Restaurants,"I'm weary of this place.. I only came here since it's one of the few drive thru's that offer Pepsi products. I ordered a meal and everything went down fine... It wasn't till a few hours later that I started having stomach pains and everything came back up. I know myself well enough to know what eating bad food does to me - I feel worlds better after the fact & there was a huge time gap to know it wasn't my breakfast. This has me question the cleanliness of this establishment. Needless to say, I will never be returning...",1
Restaurants,"Skimpy on the beef and won't honor FREE COOKIE coupon. All it takes is to READ IT - it says free with ANY full-price purchase, NOT free with any full-price SANDWICH. GEEZE !",1
Restaurants,A great place to stop off for a drink and the food is excellent!  Locally owned - a gem in the neighborhood,5
Restaurants,"At the end of a long day and you want some great food in the neighborhood stay away from the chains and visit  locally owned Auslers Grill.  The daily specials truly are, do yourself a favor and enjoy one.",5
Restaurants,Changed to Native New Yorker - same owner (Rod Ticknor),5
Restaurants,"Blech. We ate here over a year ago when we first moved here...never to return. It tasted like ""Mexican"" food you get in Kansas. Low quality and not very authentic. Sorry...didn't care for it at all.",2
Restaurants,"I'll be honest, I wasn't particularly impressed the first time that I ate here 2+ years ago. Since then, I've gradually come to really enjoy the food here, and we have gotten an explanation as to some previous inconsistencies with the food here at a certain point in the past (management/cooking staff changes were made). I normally order a two taco combo plate (the shredded beef is what I opt for), and they're pretty good. What really makes this place a win for me personally is their queso dip and their salsa. I swear, I could eat just chips and salsa/queso and be happy if I had to. Anyway, if you're in the Anthem area, this is one of the better options if you're looking to get away from the typical chain restaurant dining that plagues that area.",4
Restaurants,This place is disgusting! I've tried it multiple times over the past 10 years and still it is truly awful. I keep hoping they'll figure something out for the better.,1
Restaurants,"We have stopped her numerous times on our way back up to Flag over the last 9 years, and it's been our ""go to"" place to meet with friends who live in Anthem.  The food and serve has always been good.  We try some thing different each time, and each time it's been tasty.",4
Restaurants,Great beef fried rice at a good price.,5
Restaurants,"I really only get the fried rice togo here, and I'm always searching for good house special FR. Its a full meal in itself. Anyway its pretty good here, lots of meat and veggies, rice is tender and you get a couple or stuffed wontons for free with the order....those are good too. They don't deliver but usually have preorders hot and ready for you. Good place with a wide selection and a picture menu on the counter just in case....",4
Restaurants,"One of the bottom 3 restaurants in my entire life.
1) The place is filthy. Floor had food on it, table was sticky.
2) The girl at the counter was rude.
3) I ordered Kung Pao Chicken. It had no pepper and no peanuts and was EXACTLY the same plate as my friend that ordered Teriyaki chicken. It was neither Kung Pao OR Teriyaki.
4) We asked what was up with the order, they said they were out of peanuts, peppers and teriyaki sauce.
5) We asked for our money back and they refused to refund money even though we did not get what we ordered and did not eat what they gave us.
6) I happened to notice that you also have to pay full price for refills, even tea.

This was over a year ago, but I forgot to rate it then....
Horrible horrible establishment.
If you want dirty rude atmosphere with low end food that you did not order, go here for sure.",1
Restaurants,"I love this place. They have the best egg rolls and sesame seed chicken ever! I have looked and tried many other restaurants and no one makes their sesame seed like them.  Their egg rolls are awesome, very plump and very cheap! Their house special rice is also great, it has chicken, beef, pork and shrimp in it.  I have been going here for years and was always sad when I moved away. Only thing I wish is their prices were not that much, they have gone up in price but its worth it if you are craving something in particular. I recommend trying the sesame chicken and the house special rice.  They also have a drive thru so if you don't mind waiting in your car, I say go check it out!",4
Restaurants,"Excellent food, great prices. Definitely check it out.",5
Restaurants,"I was starving and decided to give this place a try as it was on my way home from work.  When I called in a pick up order I was disappointed that they didn't have tofu.  I ordered veggies.  I had no idea what I would get when I arrived to pick up but was craving Chinese so I was taking a chance.  The lady that took my order and rang me up was friendly enough.  The place was clean enough (with multiple fish tanks around).  The food was super hot.  Rice was good and the cream cheese wontons that I got were DELICIOUS.  The veggies were mostly broccoli, carrots and bean sprouts.  They were really overcooked in a white sauce.  I ate them and my kids really liked it but I'm not sure I would bother to order them again.",3
Restaurants,"Hunger struck and Happy Food was nearby.  The place was clean with a number of useless aquaria, meaning that they were not attractive, not kept properly and scum had accumulated on the glass.  The purpose of an aquarium is to bring some beauty to the surroundings.  This was not the case but the least of this restaurant's problems.  
The pricing was rather inexpensive and was surprised that the lunch combinations included 3 choices plus fried rice for 5.89.  Crazy, right?  I ordered the pork chow mein, vegetable egg foo yung & an egg roll as my choices to be accompanied with fried rice.  My eating partner just had an egg drop soup.  It took a while for the orders to come so I took that as a sign that everything was freshly prepared.  
The orders came in styrofoam containers.  My pork chow mein was a 2 on a scale of 5, the vegetarian egg foo yung came as a hockey puck so I would say it is also a 2, the egg roll was small (that's Ok) with veggies.  It was not over fried.  The fried rice that came with the dish was inedible---hard grains of rice stuck together.  You had to put a fork in it to dislodge the grains.  I did not eat it.  I ate what I could of the combination keeping in mind that I had only paid $5.89 for it.  The egg drop soup looked gelatinous--full of corn starch, but the person eating it said it was not bad. Does that also mean not good?  
The woman who took our order and our payment never came by to ask how the food was which to me is an indicator that a restauranteur takes his/her  business seriously.  You certainly want customer feedback.  I would not have been cruel but instead made constructive suggestions.  I still don't understand why they give a choice of 3 items for the combos.  That is taxing on the cook--making 3 dishes for each lunch ordered UNLESS, UNLESS... it is all pre-prepared and all he is doing is re-heating it on the wok.  Just thinking.... 
Anyway, this is NOT a place where I will ever be seen again.  I usually give restaurants a second go round, but I cannot do it here.  The food is just too sub-par. Frankly, I don't know how they stay in business.  
 If this restaurant had been really good, I would have driven from home (13 miles away) to eat here--that's how loyal I am to a good restaurant.  
Stay away folks.... there is nothing here that you want.",1
Restaurants,"I had the chicken noodle soup plate during lunch. It came with a side of crab rangoons in a sweet and sour sauce.  It was good. Nothing great, but good. The prices here are cheap! Lunch Rice bowls from 4.19 to 5.19. Most expensive item on menu is 8.59, whiich are shrimp meals.

The place overall is clean. Simply decorated. Booths and the sound of fish tanks circulating water and classical music. Plates are Styrofoam and plastic ware. Menu displayed in word and in pictures. Easy to follow.

The only thing that really put me off is the tray where my food was served... it was sticky. =S it kind of makes me question the cleanliness of the kitchen.",3
Restaurants,"Ordered 2 Chicken Dishes. 
They both tasted like they were cooked in old/burnt oil.
Could not eat anything that I ordered.

Additionally, I did not like the fact that inside there as a dirty fish aquarium with a fish that was 1/3 the size of the tank. Cruel. 

Not Recommended!",1
Restaurants,Odd place. Rude asian lady behind the counter literally yelled at a customer and threw their condiments at her. Mediocre food.. wondered if I was on candid camera at one point. Can't believe they stay in business.,1
Restaurants,How about you do something about that turtle aquarium? If you care so little about them I can't imagine how well you care for your customers and the cleanliness of your kitchen. Will never eat at your place.,1
Restaurants,"Prompt, efficient and friendly service. Much better than average JIB. Keep up the good work!",4
Restaurants,"Thanks Jack! The food was good, service was fast. It was Jack In The Box. We do not have this in Florida, so it was a nice treat on this trip. Jack In The Box tacos and curly fries are still my favorite.

This place was particularly clean.",3
Restaurants,"I'm so sick of this place screwing up orders! I stopped going there for over 6mo for just this reason...figured if I stopped by now, surely they have new staff, management, etc. and possibly the food and service quality has improved. I was WRONG. C'mon folks, it's fast food, for goodness sakes...   Jack has standard operating procedures; you make the burgers this way, you fry potatoes this way, (and you throw them out if they've been sitting in the warmer for over an hour, for goodness sakes) *face palm*

The buns used in this JIB always seem ""day old"", the fries are NEVER fresh, the letuce sems consistently wilted, and to top it all off - the right food doesn't ever make it into the bag! 
I give up, no more for me, store is right around the corner from my home but I will drive 4extra miles to a different JIB.",1
Restaurants,"I drove 30+ miles on my way home and could have stopped several times,  but I wanted Jack in the Box near home so it would be hot. I came through at 4am on 1/15/14 and there were bun crates sitting out blocking the drive through. The sign says open 24 hours. Period. Now I'm off work, going to be hungry because someone doesn't know what 'open 24 hours' means. This is poor POOR business practice.",1
Restaurants,"Stopped in to grab a few tacos, and the register I was waiting to order from broke down on the customer in front of me. I knew I was in for a wait. But Brandon handled it like a true professional. He tried a few things  (smiling and happy the entire time) but when the register didn't respond he was able to flag down the manager who was busy co-ordinating orders and get the problem resolved. A new cash till was brought up and in no time the second register was up and running. Thanks Brandon for going the extra mile and getting things faster than I was expecting. Good job. You're a credit to your store and the organization.",3
Restaurants,"I'm not a fan usually of Jack, but I love their peppermint oreo milkshake. We went through the drive thru on Tuesday evening, and the girl working behind the counter had so many facial piercings, her phone was about to fall out of her butt pocket and she had SO much skin showing. She also was not in any type of uniform, as she was wearing American Eagle and pink brand clothes (don't think Jack is paying for that for everyone). To each his own after work hours, but I do not want to see your belly skin as you hand me my food. I had hoped that even though they were fast food that they'd have a professional standard. Not a fan, won't be back.",1
Restaurants,"On my way to Mountain Vista Medical Center, with a limited restaurant selection in the area, I caved and went to J in the B. There is a Burger King under construction in close proximity, but I would have still opted for here rather than there. The service was courteous and the wait time was short for it being a fast-paced lunch hour. I was looking for a cheap bite; $5 or less was the goal. I ordered the junior bacon cheeseburger and 10 piece nuggets. The burger came out flat, but ok. Lots of bacon, though not much flavor. The nuggets came out piping hot and were the best part of the meal. There's a digital soda dispenser if you choose to dine-in. That was a nice touch. Overall, no strong complaints. It was the quick meal I needed on the outskirts of town.",3
Restaurants,"Always fast friendly service.  Fresh hot fries. Great food.
I highly recommend it for breakfast.",5
Restaurants,Very slow service. Food is typical for BK.,2
Restaurants,"It's a Burger King like any other.  I prefer their reheated ""flame broiled"" burgers over McD's.  It's serves it's purpose and it's on our way from Big League Dreams to the US60.",3
Restaurants,"Brand new remodel. Unfortunately they didn't renovate what needed it most, the employees! Service is awkward and very slow. ""Mgr"" just walked into the restroom with his food prep apron on. Nice.",2
Restaurants,"If you have time to kill, you will be just fine...employees at this joint are not, I repeat ARE NOT, going to break thier neck to help you, take your order, etc.  They are getting paid by the hour and making it real obvious...but anyway brand new remodel so it looks snazzy, and food wise got exactly what I ordered and how I wanted it...when I finally got it...",2
Restaurants,"Nothings changed here. Walked up to order breakfast, and the ""manager"" and crew members just ignored me. Guess why? They were discussing how to increase sales! Priceless.",1
Restaurants,"This is the worst Burger King I been to! They served old overcooked French fries and the fish burger was old, lettuce old!! Yuk!!",1
Restaurants,"This place is a go-to for me on days I can't get out of work on time to go home for lunch. The 2 stars are for the insta-shits I got after eating a mostly mediocre whopper with cheese today. In all seriousness, beware. It was no bueno.",2
Restaurants,"Greasy, old reheated food that just stinks!

I always make the mistake of going there once a year and immediately regret it.

Stay away!!",1
Restaurants,"I take myself and I keep on saying out loud to myself ""I'm wanting a shake"" my friend wants one too so after the cashier here's us and when we ask to order he says the shake machines busted. I also had to go up to the counter 3 more times because of horrible service.",2
Restaurants,This place was neat! I've never been to such a cool restaurant. I didn't know that places like this existed! Hashtag awesome.,5
Restaurants,"I went through the drive through, ordered some chicken fries and a chicken nugget kids meal. I asked for ranch and the guy said ""okay"". I get to the window and ask for ranch again and he looks at me like I had 3 heads, barely acknowledging me. Someone else comes to the window hands me my food and slams the window shut. I look in the bag, no ranch. I ask again for some and he hands me 2. Um, I need more than that so he reluctantly hands me a few more. 
The employee barely said 2 words to me and they were ""$8.52"" and ""here"" when he handed me the ranch. 
This BK always has bad service and a bunch of yoyos working there. Get your act together and train these people and make fresh food. What happened to ""have it your way""?",1
Restaurants,"My husband & I have used the same Burger King for years, but it has gone down hill.  We don't go as frequently as we use to as they can not seem to get the order right!  Last night we came in with coupons (no problem) and ordered a total of 3 burgers (1 DBL CHS & 2 BAC CHS [1 w/no cheese] 2 SM FRYS, and 2 SM SODAS.  This order was a TO-GO order.  We got home and (as usual) cheese was in ALL 3 burgers!  I do not like cheese in my burger but I love to have the bacon!  Someone in the production area is NOT reading the order slip as everything was correct on the slip.  The rest of the order was okay but certainly nothing special or exciting enough for a quick return.  It will be another several months before I will be willing to try again.  Survey Code: 94282-27011-03902-150152.",2
Restaurants,"Went through the drive through at 9 pm on my way home. Ordered a Whopper with lettuce, tomato, and ketchup. 
Got home, opened my food, and found i'd been given a Whopper with mayo, pickle, onion, and lettuce. After eating 3/4 of the burger, discovered long black hair in my burger. Will not be returning to this location.",1
Restaurants,Can you ever go wrong with tator tots or cherry limeade?? I think not! The burgers are alright but I prefer in and out for those. So I stick with tots and limeade here ;),4
Restaurants,Always tasty. Try a java chiller in mocha or caramel.,4
Restaurants,Rarely do I come sonic but only when i have coupons. The little kids they had working on the night of 9/23 were loud and disrespectful. I had to repeat my order 3 times stating i had a coupon. Only to have the child raise their voice at me like she was a man. Chick needs to learn some respect and listen to the order the first time instead of giggling and acting like a complete uneducated idiot. Never coming here again and nor will anyone i hang around with.,1
Restaurants,"I was dissapointed with their customer service. We waited in the drive through for at least 5 min before hey finally got to us. We were the only ones in line, but they were either too busy or understaffed to help. When we finally got our order placed, there was someone behind us. We were waiting for them to get our order out, but the lady came out and gave the car behind us their order first! They served the vehicle behind us first and we waited and extra 10 min past that to actually get our meal. There were only two of us and it wasn't a large order, but it took them way too long. Dissapointing, but at least the food was decent.",2
Restaurants,"We went to this Sonic tonight because my Hubby wanted a chili cheese hotdog. We drove into one of the bay's, hit the button and nothing, for 5 minutes nothing. I moved the car to the next bay over, pushed the button and again nothing. This time we sat for 10 min waiting. I ended up going to the drive thru where we sat for another 15 minutes to have out order taken. They finally took the order, repeated it back to me 3 times. The girl was really rude about everything even after we had been waiting for so long. We paid and left. When we got home the chili cheese ""hotdog"" was in fact chili cheese tater tots. After all that they couldn't even get the order right. Terrible service. I won't be going back.",1
Restaurants,"The usual Sonic drive thru. Love the happy hour half price slushi drinks. The foot long coney hotdog was really good and lots of chilli. Love the onion rings. 
The service was awful. It took got ever to take our order. They need to get more workers to help the few that were going crazy.",2
Restaurants,"I am only giving it 1 star cause it's making me!! I ordered Iced Tea and they charge you for the lemon ..., I've never heard of such a thing and my daily runs to Sonic are no longer!!",1

Public Services & Government,"Metro fire is run by great guys.  Kent Rasmussen is superb and he is very friendly, very knowledgable about what he does.  You can't go wrong with these guys.",5
Restaurants,"This Jack in the Box is pretty good.  Fast service, clean restaurant, filled-to-the top shakes and drinks at the drive-through.  I like having this place close by for 24-hour American fast food.  The children I've seen inside have appeared happy, so they must have good toys and meals.  The chocolate milk shakes are the best!",3
Restaurants,Soooo slow....even the drive through,1
Restaurants,They get my order wrong every time,1
Restaurants,Can't beat the tacos in a pinch,3
Restaurants,"I love jack in the box but I hate this location! They always forgot something ! And they are always rude, I went the other day and they took 20 mins for 1 thing  , so i asked for a refund b/c i was on my way to work ! & they man looks at me at say's ""im sorrry i forgot your food is done and hands me my bag ?""  I was angry and walked out!",1
Restaurants,"39 minutes to get 3 breakfast sandwiches. Worst experience in a fast food place ever.
Staff was rude, food was ice cold. 
I saw at least 7 people walk out without any food at all. Cashier could not even figure out how to give someone a receipt.

I like Jack In the Box, this location I would advise to avoid like the plague!!!",1
Restaurants,"Horrible drive thru service around noon today!  If you can't hear the customer, how about not scream ""what????!!!"" after each item , try ""I'm sorry can you repeat that"" or whatever other saying is in your employee training/handbook.  Seriously, there is much better way to treat customers even if this is just a drive thru fast food job... SMH",1
Restaurants,"Burgers, Fries and a milkshake. Life doesn't get any better. The burgers are really good and so are the fries. But what really sticks out are the milkshakes. The Oreo milkshake is my favorite and I cannot get enough. This is the place to go to satisfy that burger, fries and a milkshake craving after a hot summer day of chilling by the pool.",4
Restaurants,"Everyone in my family was sad to see this place close down several years ago but we were all excited to see it open again on a recent trip.  Great fries, great garden burgers (most of us are vegetarian) and great milkshakes.  A recent trip to Chandler Mall included lunch at Ruby's followed by a trip later in the shopping spree to consume some milkshakes.  Not a bad way to spend the day (and 5,000 calories!).",5
Restaurants,"I love me some diner food and this is a good place to find it.  4 stars for the diner category.  Our first visit here was for brunch.  I tried out the Carnitas Skillet.  It was good, but I discovered carnitas is not great in a scramble.  The potatoes were great.  My wife had Huevos Rancheros and was gracious enough to share with me...good stuff.

The kids had a burger & mac' n cheese.  Both were good.  The staff here was very friendly and helpful and every request for this or that was met with a ""sure!"".

Our waitress was very good and had this almost Amy Winehouse look going on.  I thought she was hitting on my wife as she kept referring to her as ""sweetie"" or ""honey"" or ""babe"" or...but by midway through the meal this had transferred to all of us.",4
Restaurants,"This is fun, Alaskan, wood-lodge style eatery located in the same complex as the Chandler Mall.

amazingly, for being so close to the mall, you get some pretty good seafood for a really good price.

they have a full bar, compete with HH specials, though i don't recall being very impressed with the choices.",5
Restaurants,"I am a complete fish lover.  Growing up that was my staple -- fish, all kinds of seafood, octopus, lobster, crab...I think you get the idea.

I had passed this place on the way home one night and vowed to see what it was about.  I checked out their website -- not too shabby!

Hubby and I decided to give it a go the other night.

What a disappointment.  I can't even articulate about how overcooked my food was or how meagre the service was.  I practically begged for water and silverware.

Words cannot describe how angry I felt when I left.  The food, the service, utterly disappointing.

I ordered their Cedar Plank Salmon.  The salmon was so overdone that the edges were past the point of crisp -- they were burnt.  I asked our server if I could please get one that was not quite so charred.  I swear she rolled her eyes at me.

The sides were the only highlight of that meal.  Hubby's meal was ""ok"" by his standards, but I could see a stream of resentment building in him.

It was a Thursday night, not too packed, but busy enough.  Our server was more concerned with her chatter with the other servers.  It's one thing to have friends at work, but you don't neglect the customer.  I saw that we were not the only ones who bore the brunt of her bad service.

When my plate came back, she slammed the dish down so hard that the salmon almost fell onto the table.

Surly much?

I can't give this place a good recommendation.  Their beer selection was ho hum as was their mixed drinks.

Not a place I would recommend for friends or out of towners.",1
Restaurants,"Eh.  Service was okay, food was okay, not terrible, but not terribly impressed.

Oppressively dark (in terms of lack of lumens of light) ambiance. 

Coconut shrimp appetizer was tasty enough but nothing special.  Pecan-encrusted trout entree was a little dry; accompanying green beans were fun but the potatoes were outright boring.",3
Restaurants,"well, maybe it was the  time I went or what I had but I would have to give them about the same rating as I would give red lobster. I can't understand how anyone could like Red lobster if you know what good seafood is.I was born and grew up with family from Baltimore Maryland where good seafood is what the city is about.I was excited to try it as I love seafood but my food just was not good. I can't say my service was all the great either. I would not go again",1
Local Flavor,"Had a living social deal through Drivetech, which borrowed this track. It was kind of hard to find, but once we were there, it was smooth sailing. I bought my bf an introductory class to drive his own formula one racecar, and he had a blast. They give you about 30 min of track time and you can go around and around like the pros (just maybe a little slower). The staff there were all really nice and really focus on making the experience enjoyable for the people riding/driving.",4
Local Flavor,"I came here for the NHRA Finals on Sunday 10/16/11 and I had a great time. The last time I was out here was about 10 years ago for some Top Fuel Hydro races and honestly, not a lot has changed (except for pricing lol). 
Also I think every ticket is eligible for pit area access now. Years ago you had to purchase a pit pass if you wanted to check that section out. If you do decide to visit the pit area be sure to stand behind a Dragster or Funny Car when they start it up. Its one of the coolest things you'll ever experience although its not recommended for the faint of heart. Once that NitroMethane fills the air around you your eyes, nose and throat immediately start to burn. It wears off pretty fast but its funny to see everyone running towards fresh air while coughing ( I won't lie, I was one of them).
 My overall experience was amazing although its probably better to go during the February races, due to the fact that its still pretty hot out there in October. 
Be sure to bring enough cash because everything is pretty pricey but thats to be expected. I think a large beer was about $9.50. GEEZUS!!! Oh and also plan on spending a good half hour trying to get out of there after the races. If you're not in a hurry to leave try to stick around because traffic is a nightmare right after the final race. You can waste some time by going down on the track, which, by the way is really, really sticky (one of my shoes almost fused to the track :D). Or you can buy some discounted food and drink but its definitely not a good idea to leave right away.",4
Local Flavor,"This track is legit. Very smooth, high traction and no issues. I've enjoyed taking my car out. There are usually sanctioned events going on like bracket racing and whatnot. I just casually take my car out to the drags just for fun and the thrill of it. 

For first-timers, ask their staff questions. There isn't any signs pointing you from the Tech Inspection to the staging lanes and can be a bit confusing. However, the staff is helpful.

The water box is fairly modest and is easy to drive around if you want to avoid water on your tires. 

The only thing holding me back from five stars is the limited availability of the track during Friday and Saturday nights. I've been to the track more than a couple times and they have been closed and had to go all the way to Speedworld. If they could be more open, more frequently on Fri/Sat nights, it would be great.",4
Local Flavor,I come here to go to Pro Autosports and NASA events. NASA is having road racing on the East track 3-25-14 and 3-16-14 and I went today to hang out with friends and take a few pics. The track is nice and you can bring your sports car and run on the road course. They have different classes for different types of cars and levels of drivers. If you have not run before you have to take a class and get a license but is fun and you will get an instructor to help you learn to drive safe and fast on the course.,5
Local Flavor,Firebird Raceway is a top-notch organization and the owners do more for the local community than most people realize.  Very classy - excellent place to be entertained.  AWSOME experience.,5
Restaurants,"Let me ask you this, have you ever had breakfast, lunch and dinner at the same restaurant in the same day?

Usually I stray away from reviews of places we're all familiar with, but today I thought I would give the Sonic some l-o-v-e.  Especially since, I ate at the same Sonic three (tres, 3, iii) times today.

For breakfast I got the Bistro Sandwich with Bacon, Egg and Cheese. I usually toss one of the buns and have it open faced. I don't want to appear gluttonous. :P

For lunch, a Wacky Pack with a hamburger, tots and a small iced tea. The prize was a plastic bug catcher.

For dinner, I had a hot fudge sundae and tots.

Hey, I've gotta go, I hear they have .99 root beer floats till midnight.",3
Restaurants,"My husband that wears hearing aids went to surprise me & bring home breakfast. He got out of the car & went to the patio.  He push button & tried to order but could not hear the lady. He asked if the lady could come outside. Since he was on the patio close to the door he did not think it would be any trouble. The lady said ""come back with someone that can hear"". I am so angry. I will never go to Sonic again.",1
Restaurants,"Remind me never to drive thru here again. If I check-in again - shoot me. I'm not a huge fan of Sonic, except I like their limeades and crushed ice. I've never been to this location before and I won't recommend it.

The service was fine. The gentleman who took our order was patient and nice. However, whoever prepared the food didn't prepare it as we ordered it. I asked for no mayo and got mayo. That pretty much ruins the burger. How can you take mayo off? Yuck. My daughter's chicken whatevers (bits? pieces? nuggets?) caused her to ask ""Is this chicken?"" She's 10, and not that picky. So that must have been pretty bad.

I thought it interesting that the drive thru guy encouraged me to fill out the survey to be entered for a drawing for a free something or other. Why? Because he didn't give my daughter any honey mustard sauce after he attentively asked how many packets she wanted. I usually don't fill out those surveys. I may start now...

Nice drive-thru guy. But absent-minded (I suppose we all have those days.)
Good slushes and limeade. (This would be the only reason I'd come back.)
Bad food.",1
Restaurants,Decent food with a decent staff and wait time. Pretty consistent order accuracy.,4
Restaurants,"I'm surprised at the number of bad reviews this location has!

I've been to this same location for years and years as I live .1 mile away.

I love to get the Blackberry Sweet Tea...

I go early in the morning on my way to work and order the spicy jumbo popcorn chicken. I'm glad they serve lunch at 6 am because I hate all things breakfast.

I bring my doggies there and they give them milkbones! How thoughtful...

Anyways, the shakes are great too! There's real fruit in them!

Sonic is an awesome place in general.... With happy hour and all.

5 stars.",5
Restaurants,This place has the longest wait times you will ever experience. Don't even attempt to go through the drive-through because you will spend at least 15 minutes waiting. There are plenty of other places nearby for me to go.,1
Restaurants,"Friendly staff. Not sure why I continue to use the drive through. If there is a long line, it's quicker to pull into a stall and order.",4
Restaurants,"Like many others, the drinks are good, but I am reviewing the drinks. I drove through to get a few grilled chicken sandwiches for my husband & I. We also substituted onion rings for fries. They were the greasiest onion rings in town!
 All I have to say is that everything was horrible, Horrible, HORRIBLE!!! The chicken was DISGUSTING...100% inedible! It looked nasty, and tasted worse, like a rubber chicken! We get AMAZING grilled chicken sandwiches at Wendy's, and after this, I will never again mess with perfection! Oh, and as everyone else already said, the drive thru is ridiculous! I actually called them & sent my husband back to get our money back. I will have to say that they kindly agreed! ;)",1
Restaurants,I just went here to get a shake and waited like 15 minutes in the drive thru. They messed up my order by putting hot fudge so when I got my shake it was like nuke warm. This was a horrible disappointment!!! Will never be going to this one again!,2
Restaurants,"While my drink was delicious, I waited in the drive thru for at least 15 minutes when there was only one car ahead of me.  I expected the car in front to have an order of 10 bags or so, but it appeared all they ordered were 2 drinks and a shake! What can possibly take so long?",2
Restaurants,"Saturday I ordered a cheeseburger,  2pc poppers and onion rings.. Not only did I wait 10 minutes the fried food were as hard as rocks, and I was given a double cheeseburger and charged for a double cheeseburger and large poppers.  
Very unhappy!",1
Restaurants,This place is awful. Food tastes bad and slushies taste like tap water. If you want sonic drive a couple extra miles to a different one because this is not sonic.,1
Restaurants,"Saturday I ordered a cheeseburger,  2pc poppers and onion rings.. Not only did I wait 10 minutes the fried food were as hard as rocks, and I was given a double cheeseburger and charged for a double cheeseburger and large poppers.  
Very unhappy!",1
Restaurants,"Terrible! The food tasted so awful, I think their fryer oil must be old or something? I didn't think you could mess up tater tots. Who knew?!",1
Restaurants,This is a great location and fast friendly service. Especially the Manager Melissa she is very professional and nice.,4
Restaurants,"Today in the drive-thru I ordered some drinks and food. I was quoted around $7 at the screen. I drove up, and then was quoted ""$9.66"" I handed over my card and realized the increase, and just figured I would check my receipt. Then I heard the cashier say ""F*** my life, I just charged her the wrong amount."" There was discussion inaudible between her and another worker. I waited a few minutes waiting for them to apologize or admit the mistake and refund me. Instead I watched them sticker the receipt to the next bag, throw my receipt in the bag and handed me my bag and card without a word.
I checked my receipt, sure enough $7. I checked my bank account, $9.66.
I got out of my car and informed them they had overcharged me, and they knew it. The other lady helping the cashier just says ""If we overcharged you, we wouldn't have done it on purpose."" Well I'm not stupid. They both knew they overcharged me. That's why they just threw the bag in the receipt instead of attaching it on the outside of the bag and didn't say a thing. That's just absolutely ridiculous to me. I get it, mistakes happen. Just admit it and fix it, that's totally fine to me. But to not even TRY to fix it and just hope I don't notice, that's astounding to me. I have to give good customer service at my job, I expect the same. Nothing was ever acknowledged, there was no apology. I just got a snarky reply when I brought it up.
Their names were Sade and Serena. I don't know which is which, but either way they both don't give a shit about customer service. Don't bother going to this location, there are way better fast food joints and an awesome drink place called Sodalicious is less than a mile away.",1
Restaurants,"I feel bad about giving this place two stars... really.

Last sunday, my mom and I were out on a power shopping spree at the pavillions when she said she wanted to go to Souper Salad, not wanting to i begruggingly agreed. We even dug through our back seat looking for their coupon in the sunday paper for a discount! We walked up and sat down and saw their DIRTY patio furniture... wtf?! Don't these people own a hose?! That was so dirty, I couldn't imagine trying to have a nice al fresco dining experience there! Luckily for me, it was the dirtiest part of the resturant.

We approached the door when a very loud man came and opened the door and exchanged pleasantries over and over again and was very happy to see us. Ummm... thanks? but can we atleast order our drinks first? He was a little happy. I unno - I was in a good mood, but I sorta just wanted to be left alone to eat. We got our salads and the greens were semi wilted and the cesar salad needed to be refilled but didn't :( and so I was left with some odd franken salad I threw together on my own. It wasn't that great - but that's my own doing. 

Their pasta salads and cole slaw and some of their fixin's looked very old and unappetizing! I couldn't even imagine eating them! I wished they had potato salad or carrot slaw (is that the word?) and macaroni salad... it wasn't good. But things did lighten up when I came across the soups.

I loooove soups!! They are my salvation after a hard day. I cozied up to a lil bowl of tomato based soup with mini shell pasta and veggies, it was delish! So was the Veggie Beef soup. I wish it didn't have so much onion,but I'm not a big fan of onions. and their tacos were GOOOOOD... not write home and tell everyone about it good... but very good. They remind me of the kind of tacos you make at home, out of a box but not all craptastic like how they come out when I do it. I honestly liked it. 

The cornbread was dry and my mom said her baked potato was too. The pizza looked too old to touch, so I unno about that one. 

The service was another thing... the same man, who I'm assuming is the owner always kept talking. Even when my mom said something along the lines of just wanting to enjoy our meals and we thanked him for his hospitatlity. But damn... SHUT UP! I felt like he wanted to sit down and talk shop with us... but we weren't there to meet with him... we were there to talk with one another. But he always refilled our drinks and cleared our plates away quickly. So he got to keeep a star. 

To my fellow yelpers: if you're in the area and want fresh salads, this might not be the place for you... especially if you want to eat outside cafe style on nice clean patio furniture... but if you want a nice cozy bowl (or several like me) of soup and decent bread sticks then this place will hit the spot. You might need to shoo away the owner though in order to get some privacy and enjoy the people you arrive there with.",2
Restaurants,"Why is it so difficult to find a decent salad bar here in PHX? This place doesn't cut it- Its overpriced, and the food besides the salad is mediocre at best. Besides that, the salad items are very generic, nothing stands out as being original, unique or different. Skip it.",2
Restaurants,"I had to come here, it's a West Coast tradition right? I was more excited to visit Phoenix for the food than to go to the Blackhawks vs. Coyotes game. I was biased based on my In-N-Out Burger experience, it has been on my wish list for YEARS. We passed a Jack-In-the Box and figured why not? This place is kind of like a Wendy's mated with a McDonald's but with the quality of a Burger King. There are a decent amount of options, enough to please even the pickiest of eaters (or someone who just has no idea what they want, story of my life). I went with just a plain chicken sandwich, after maxing on In-N-Out Animal Style can you really blame me? It was good, consistent, and not too greasy. The fries weren't mushy, which I appreciate. Nothing is worse that a gushy, mushy fry. On the way to the airport, this place was the perfect stop. The service was fast and efficient. I'm not sure if I would make the conscious decision to eat here again, but I'll try anything once!",3
Restaurants,"Just had breakfast there by going thru the drive through.  I work on the road so I unfortunately go through drive thru's a lot more then I want to admit but wow, horrible service and the drive thur lady was so very very rude.",2
Restaurants,"I will not go back to this Jack in the Box, this is the closest location to my work and I went here often. Every time I go  the place is dirty smells like a bathroom and quiet often I receive very un-friendly service (very unusual for Scottsdale). Depending on the day I never know if my food will be up to par. On multiple occasions I have seen employee's kids running around and messing with the soda machine. I almost always get water when I eat out but their water is yellow at tastes terrible.

Don't get me wrong I like Jack in the Box as a fast food restaurant but at this location I rarely get quality food. Skip this location and go to the next closest on Shea Blvd.",1
Restaurants,"This review is based on fast Great Service in the drive-thru but mostly because of the Garlic Cheddar Buttery Jack which is as my man Daym Drops puts it, ""FIVE ALL DAY SON!!!!!""   This burger can beat most Burgers I have had most anywhere! Only only one place that even comes close is Burger Shop, this burger is Off Da Chain!!!!!",5
Restaurants,"The employees here are so rude. I went in last Saturday with my husband and they got my order wrong. Instead of apologizing and just remaking it, they argued with me over what I ordered, even though I showed them the receipt. And then after they agreed to remake it, the cook was extremely loud about his feelings about how he made the right thing and I didn't know what I was ordering. Never again J.I.T.B...never again.",1
Restaurants,"This Chili's isn't a lot different than the one on Mill.  However, not being on Mill does have its advantages with not being full of college kids all the time.  The service is pretty good and it's crowded all that often.  You can have a quiet dinner here more than at the one on Mill.  Pretty good Chili's here.",4
Restaurants,"Let me explain the 3 stars. I know the place is corporate, mundane and not all that exciting. However, when I first decided that I would be moving to Tempe it was inside this Chili's. That was more than a decade ago, but I know that I made the right decision in moving here.

The food at Chili's is worth 2 stars. The ambiance, maybe 2 as well. But at least mill ave is walking distance afterwards. The location of this Chili's is pretty good. But there are much better places to eat in the surrounding neighborhood.",3
Restaurants,Good food if you like arbys,3
Restaurants,This would be my local Arby's.  I go here every once in a while with a coupon.  This time I went because I wasn't eating meat for a month and they had a special on fish sandwiches.  I should have known better than to expect a place specializing in sliced beef to have a great fish sandwich.  But I will still keep going back for beef and cheddars.,3
Restaurants,I absolutely love Arby's!! But this location is horrible! Their food does not taste fresh.. Tastes like its been sitting out for hours.. They were completely out of napkins andtold us we could use paper towels from the bathroom.. The yogurt they gave my toddler with his meal had expired a week prior. Their service is horrible. Had to wait at register for several minutes and actually call out for someone before we received assistance. Would not recommend this location to anyone.,1
Restaurants,"This is the SLOWEST drive-thru ever. I waited for 25 minutes with two cars in front of me...what ever happened to ""please pull into a parking space and we'll bring it out to you"" to avoid holding up the whole line? Cashier apologized, asked me if I wanted sauce and offered free chocolate pastry. Guess what? No sauce and no chocolate pastry to be found in my bag. Seriously, if I ever want fast food in my area again I'll just drive the extra mile to Sonic.",1
Restaurants,"The furnishings were clean & updated. Had greasy smell when walked in door, but I expect that from fast food establishment. Everything we ordered was exceptionally fresh. The bread was fresh, staff sliced the roast beef fresh. The cooking area appears clean and the staff was friendly. I'm glad we stopped in. $15 for two to eat (drank water) and one yummy Salty Caramel shake. 
Almost didnt stop in because of last review. And, they play American country music if anyone is interested (im not fond of it, but it is different for Phoenix, AZ).",5
Restaurants,"Good food, great service! Quick!",5
Restaurants,I just ordered a salad and it had at least three things wrong. I asked for no tomatoes and it was covered in them. I received the wrong dressing and was missing my sauce. The salad was also supposed to have bacon but that was missing too (and had little cheese).I ended up with almost $9 for a bowl of lettuce and a small soda. I won't be back..,1
Restaurants,"This place is good if you get the roast beef or the seasonal fish sandwiches. Now they have the chicken sandwiches which is a huge mistake. Instead of getting more fryers, they use the same fryer they cook the curly frys in. The sandwich had the most nasty aftertaste ive ever eaten. When I called them they admitted that the fryers needed to be changed but they wern't alowed to change them. The frys were also dark brown and I didn't even eat them all. The prices are also crazy high for a fast food place. 2.35 for a large drink and 2.65 for a large fry. Your basicly paying for a meal without the sandwhich so always get the meal, cause you basicly get the sandwich for a dollar more. Arby's needs to stick to what they do best, fish and roast beef.",1
Restaurants,"The staff here were very out going, super friendly.  Food was asked to be made Special and the did it with no problem and everything was hit and fresh.",5
Restaurants,sat in line forever. no one in line in the drive through. how is that there is a wait? lady told me she would be with me in a minute. What they doing? Lazy. I just left. 6/5/2016 at 740pm,1
Restaurants,Great food! Good prices.,5
Restaurants,"Boy is the name a temptation.Seriously :)  I'll try to be fair though but I'm writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing. So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.  

Texas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.

Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn't. :( 

Entrees.

Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:) 

Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned. 

Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.

Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible: 

Steak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.  ( that's for this occasion only , past two times it's been great fun for the kid,)

1.5 rounded to 1 for the carrots.",1
Restaurants,"So, its Friday night and we decide to drive 40 miles to try Lone Star.  I asked my daughter to call and see if she can get us a reservation since I hate to wait.  She made the call and was told that we didnt need a reservation and ""they would take care of us when we got there"".  Okay?   When we walked in to the Lone Star there was 3 or 4 couples waiting to be seated and I was told it would be 15 minutes.  I asked if they accepted reservations and was told ""only for 6 or more people"".  How nice.  

We were seated about 15 minutes later and promptly waited on.  The server had no expression, no personality, no nothing....  Like a robot.  

Our food was average and best and very salty.  It was nothing special and the bill was about $75.00 for two adults and two teenage girls.   

We will not be returning....",2
Restaurants,Family and I thought this place wasn't too bad. Daughter loved their salads. Wife also enjoyed hers. Mine must not have been that great since I can not remember what I ate!!!! It has been ten days ago since we were there. But once again I am drawing an blank. The service was decent though!,3
Restaurants,"Stopped in at 1:00 on a Sunday, seated quickly. Friendly server (Garrett).  The bread they serve was warm, moist and very good. I had a cup of chili, it was pretty good, had the right amount of spice, even my 8 y.o. liked it. We all chose the ""Sunday sirloins"" , wife and son had sides of broccoli and sweet potato . Sweet potato could have been a bit more flavorful,  but still was OK.  Steaks were juicy but not quite done right. More medium than medium rare.",3
Restaurants,"For the life of me, I couldn't check into the location that Yelp had, so it showed this.  So lets hope it is and if not, oh well. 

For years, I literally avoided TGI Friday's because i had a boring experience there.  Yeah, I said boring.  The food was barely ok and the place was just dull.  Unfortunately that location burned down to the grown (Chandler location).

When i was there I ordered the fried mac n cheese and I gotta say, i could make better mac n cheese with my eyes closed with no ingriedients.  Talk about bland.  This was the worst appetizer Ive ever had. 

That was then..

So at this location, I had a total change of heart.  First off, TGI removed the nasty Mac N Cheese balls (good job!) and we ordered fried green beans.  Damn they were yummy!.   We got something else that was good.. Ohh yeah.. I remember.  I think it was shrimp or something.  I know, I don't remember.  But it was good too.

I got their ever popular Jack Daniels BBQ burger.  This is a  burger that is nationwide known from TGI and I finally had it.  guess what?  It's a burger with BBQ sauce on it. Nothing to go to the press over, but it was just good.  Drinks were good and refills were always coming.  So over all, the food was good.

Service was great.  We tend to all go out with a bunch of people, so Im always impressed when they handle a group of 8-10 people.  Nice work!",3
Restaurants,"It's Fridays.

Close to school, quick service and tasty food.

Got the job done, but wouldn't go out of my way to come back.",3
Restaurants,"TGIF is always my last resort kind of place. The food is meh...you get what you order and its obviously cooked by someone who's not a cook. The drinks are standard giving this place nothing special. Food quality below average to average.
The service is slow and inacurrate. It never seems like they care about you giving service quality poor.
The price is average. Not much to say about the price because it's mostly cheep, but so is the food. Value below average to average. 
Over all there's not much to say about TGIF. Definitely not worth going out of your way for or visiting when Phoenix has so much to offer. My advice to TGIF...do something big and unique and train your staff.",2
Restaurants,"I ordered at the drive thur, got the order taken and confirmed all the items I ordered.  Paid for the food and got a receipt back that is blurred and not sure what they are charging or what I ordered.  Oh well, I drove forward.  The guy says hello and then informs me that the chicken sandwich will be more than a 5 min wait so I need to park the car in the front of the store.  OK, the wait was about 6 mins but when I got home....we were missing fries and a drink.  =(",2
Restaurants,"I have to applaud this McDonalds for putting underachievers to work. Not every restaurant would take a chance on employees and managers who have no ability or desire to answer questions on menu items or read a list of ingredients to determine if allergens are included. Even when I asked the Shift Manager to read the packaging for the list of ingredients, she held tight to the values of the mediocre, and did nothing to help (well she flipped a placemat over a couple times and said she had calorie counts).  Gotta love that determination.",1
Restaurants,"Wow, the wait at the drive-thru is painful in the heat!  Even with the air-con. 

I don't know if because it was extremely hot and humid that this wait seem to take forever.  But prior to going through the drive-thru, we had parked on the other side of the building and I walked to the other side to use the restroom, taking my casual time.  By the time I returned the same car was still at the drive-thru.  And when we finally made our order and received it, it seemed as though it was too long to wait for a drink.

Take caution:  there are quite a few homeless hanging in the area.",2
Restaurants,"Service is horrendous, orders have been wrong on every visit, will not return",1
Restaurants,"Pros.
Food was fast about 2 min. Quarter pounder was cooked to order and very warm. Guy at register understood me and even helped me save a little money with my order but giving me a meal instead of ordering separate that's why I'll give 2 stars instead of one

Cons
Fries were soggy and cold. Ketchup dispenser was so dirty I didn't want to touch it. Mcnuggets were cold and way to crispy. 

I wouldn't normally chose a McDonald's but I needed fast food before I ran back across the street to the hospital to be with my girlfriend. I won't come here again while she's in the hospital.",2
Restaurants,"Wow.  I was told fries weren't ready and to park in reserved parking.  15 min later the cashier came out and served the car behind me.  Walking into the restaurant the server with the pixie haircut gave me a vacant look, asked me to confirm my order and then walked away when I asked why I was served second.  
     The real treat was to come.  As I looked into the bag, the fries were old and the quarter pounder had no meat in it.  Outstanding job gang!!!",1
Restaurants,"This McDonald's has been remodeled.  They have a new play place for the kids. It is a bit noisy but the play area is really noce. It is all contained so the kids don't get as dirty as some play places. 

The food was hot and fresh. They were super busy and we still got our food quick. The staff was courteous and was cleaning while we were there. I would recommend this place for kids and adults.",5
Restaurants,Typical McDonalds. This one is cleaner than most and has a nice indoor play area for the kids. Service is fast and the food is pretty much the same as other McDs. The ketchup dispensers ate always out and if you ask the cashiers for ketchup packets they look at you like your a weirdo.,3
Restaurants,"Fast and courteous service, it's usually packed during the day so evening and night tend to be less stressful",4
Restaurants,"I do like this restaurant for breakfast, but like most of McDonalds for lunch or dinner I've pretty much passed it by the last few years because I just can't find flavor in it's burgers anymore. 

In this case I wanted to try their new steakhouse 1/3 pound burger so went in the evening. To be honest, I kept my expectations low, and sure to form, they didn't disappoint. The burger had potential but the general McDonalds process managed to kill that potential. The size of the burger was good, but that's where it ended. It was as dry as a popcorn fart and completely lacked flavor. While the picture of the burger in their promotional material shows the sauce running out of the burger, this one literally didn't have any more sauce than the size of a nickel. The cheese and mushrooms were fine, but weren't enough to resurrect this burger from the grave. 

IF McDonalds has any hope of ever owning the fast-food market again, it's going to have to examine it's processes and get the flavor back into their food they had in the late 50's and early 60's, when the burgers were still cooked in the stores and the fries were prepared in lard. 

This location has always been clean and the service has always be pretty good, as was the case with this visit but the food quality (not limited to this location) is woefully lacking. IF there was a Culvers located within a quarter mile of every McDonalds, McDonalds would cease to exist....

I'd like to make it clear that I didn't leave McDonalds, McDonalds left me. They've changed their food preparation processes so much their food isn't even a remote representation of it's former self....the KING of fries isn't even a good ""me-too""....many places these days have better fries. I hope they can take a cold hard look at themselves and recover what they've lost....when that happens, they'll likely recover the customer base that was once extremely loyal.....",2
Restaurants,"Only ordered medium fries and a strawberry banana smoothie. It took five minutes to get my fries, but twenty minutes for them to make a single smoothie. When I finally got it, they shorted the hell out of it. Also, they are taking their breakfast items off the menu. Terrible service, terrible menu. Not coming back.",1
Restaurants,"I went through the drive through on 6-11-15 at 5:57 pm. This store is out of my way on a normal day. I ordered a kids cheeseburger(ketchup only) happy meal and some other items. My mistake for not checking the bag and box for the correct item.  
We get home start handed out food and my son opens his Happy Meal and there is no cheeseburger, all other things are in the box. So I proceed to call the store and ask for a manager. She tells me that she is sorry that the cheeseburger didn't get into the box(mean while I have a 3 year old in tears.) She said it was sitting still in the window as no on realized it didn't get into the box. She gave me two options: 1. Come back and get the food. 2. She could refund the money if she had my physical card in her hand. Neither of which worked because it was out of my way. She said she would put it on the books that I wanted a refund and when I got a chance to come back to the store, speak to a manager in duty and they would help me out. 
Today I was in that area and I decided to stop. Asked to speak to the manager, took several minutes for some one to find her. Her name was Rosaria, I told her my dilemma and what was said on 6-11-15. She proceeded to tell me that the only way I was able to get my money back was if I returned the food to them, she could give me another happy meal if I liked. I declined as it was after lunch and my son didn't want one anymore. So I asked her to check the office and see what the other manager wrote. She said there is no way I can refund the money without food being returned. 
So I turned around and told my son lets go. He's in tears again because the lady was mean and we left. 
I will NEVER return to that specific McDonald's.  That may have been the breaking point for all McDonald's.",1
Restaurants,"This place assures that  you get diarrhea after every meal. After I was done  waiting  in the extremely long line, as I told the employee what I wanted, they kept on making me repeat myself. When I got to the first window, they completely forgot my order. Once more I told them, but when I was getting ready to pay, I handed them my credit card and they said there machine was broken, so I never got my meal. I hope they do something about this.",1
Restaurants,"We came here for dinner since the hospital is right by it. First of all, my daughter ordered the 3 hotcakes and sausage. When we got our meal, it was literally 3 separate orders of Hotcakes and sausage. We didn't notice because my father paid for our dinner. Our Big Macs were cold. Not warm but cold. We took them back and they gave us hot ones, which was great. When my daughter got half way through her fries, she saw a black hair in there. My husband complained and they shrugged and said they were sorry. That was it, no trying to make it better.  The place was littered but an employee did come out towards and started sweeping.",1
Restaurants,Wish I could give negative stars. This place is gross and the employees are disrespectful lazy brats. Found clothes in their toilets. Manager didn't care.,1
Restaurants,Caught a bunch of attitude from one of the employees this morning and the food is not good. (I'm only rating the food against McDonald's itself as we all know it.) because comparing McDonald's food to anything else would not be fair. I'm done with this particular McDonald's.,1
Restaurants,"This McDonald's is usually pretty good. Yesterday though I ordered nuggets and w ice cream cones. I get to the window and the person hands me nuggets and says have a nice day. I said that I also ordered 2 cones. She brings me 1 and walks away. When she finally comes back to the window I said again that we ordered 2. She gets its and hands it to me. Not thank you, no have a nice day or anything. Thanks for messing up and acting like it was my fault.",3
Restaurants,I see a lot of complaints from this McDonalds. I came here with really low expectations because how could you expect more from one of the biggest fast food chains in the world. I'm just happy I got my food as for presentation it's fast food don't expect your buns and meat to stack up nicely like you see in commercial. The majority of people working these chains are kids that is probably working there first ever job so expect things to take long and mistakes to happen. Do you really think you'll be serve your meal from a season veteran working there 20+ years?  It's rare unless your manager position or higher. This isn't a career job so expect new hire and trainees to be taking your order and serving you. It's not like they serve you food for tip $,5
Restaurants,"So 2 for $3.33 sausage egg mcmuffin simply can't be beat. Great value. Cooked well enough. 5 stars to me. But...

The staff is an utter fail. Thee was only one who knew anything about anything. No ""thank you"" from anyone at any point. One star.

Dining room at 7:30 pm was straight up dirty.  I was the only customer in there. The drive thru was not very busy. Flies everywhere! Time to lean, time to clean, right? Uh huh! Loads of time for the employees to yuck it up with each other, though. Ray Kroc would not be happy with what has become of his company.",1
Restaurants,"This place sucks everywhere is dirty,food all over the place and a very rude shift manager ,the shift manager skinny young white kid real bossy and rude to the employees in front of costumers,  he was talking down to the older lady like if she was dumb or something really pissed me off I really wanted to tell him something ..I think if you guys promote someone to shift manager any higher up position with authority make sure their fit for the position and make sure they don't abuse the authority like this snotty lil brat shift manager that you have working today he is a real douche bag.",1
Restaurants,"There should be a NO star option because that's what they deserve.

My boyfriend and I just moved here to Arizona from California about 2 weeks ago and since being here we've noticed a huge disappointment in good customer service in the surrounding area. We wanted to go through the drive-thru to get some drinks real quick but noticed there was a massive line of cars so we decided to park and just go inside to order. HUGE mistake. 

When we walked inside the floors were spotted black everywhere and looked like they hadn't been mopped in who knows how long. The ice cream machine behind the counter was disgustingly dirty and dripping everywhere. Not exaggerating. I didn't see any employees wash their hands after handling money. There wasn't anyone in front of us so we went straight to the counter and stood there for a good 5 minutes or so until we were even acknowledged. No ""Hi,  hello, how are you, or we'll be with you in a minute"". Nothing. There were about 5 employees that were working the front and not one of them said anything to us. The supposed ""manager"" walked in, tossed something on the ground behind the counter and started talking to a couple of the employees. Still no acknowledgment, not even from the manager and she never once asked us or anyone else if we had been helped. Her and 2 other employees started complaining right in front of  us about how short handed they are, how bad they're struggling, etc, etc. Finally a worker asked another employee to take orders at the counter and when she came up  to us, not with a smile, friendly  voice, or anything, she said very rudely, ""what can I get for you"". We ordered a soda an iced coffee and asked for a water cup as well. She looked at us like we were crazy for asking for a water cup and ended up not even giving it to us so we had to wait and ask for it again. It took another good 10 minutes JUST to get an iced coffee it was so ridiculous! The place wasn't busy at all! The coffee is already made they just have to put it together! After those 10 minutes or so passed she noticed we were still standing there waiting and finally made us the drink. And after the hassle nobody once said to have a nice day or anything. 

What ever happened to nice, friendly, customer service? Obviously this place has none and if you care any little bit about cleanliness or sanitation DO NOT GO HERE. Save your money and put it to better use some place else. This business does not deserve to be open. Working in the restaurant industry for years, I definitely notice bad customer service and instantiation when I see it. This place is a joke. I'm sure all the other bad reviews were spot on and I regret not reading them before going there. Even though I shouldn't have to read reviews just to order drinks from somewhere. I'm never coming back and I will spread the word to everyone I know to do the same.

Helpful tip to the management: TRAIN YOUR STAFF BETTER.",1
Local Flavor,"Don't expect a luxury setting, but  for a tension-releasing, leisurely soak in natural hot spring water not far from Phoenix, this is the place. Tonopah used to be a center of hot spring resorts. One of the two that are still in operation there now is El Dorado, which pumps hot subterranean water into a number of small pools and bathing tubs. The setting is rustic and kitschy with historic relics and artifacts. There are private and semi-private soaking areas and rates that vary according to length of time for soaking (1 or 2 hours, or longer), and overnight accommodations are available. My friend and I opted for a 2-hour soak at the Sunset Pool area, where a wooden enclosure fence gave us privacy while affording us a nice westward (hence sunset) view while we enjoyed the hot water in the little pool constructed of natural rocks. The water was clear and hot but not intolerably so; a valve allowed us to control the flow of hot spring water. After a long relaxing soak, we cooled off on the lounge chairs and admired the view of the desert and Saddle Mountain to the west. We also enjoyed the lunch we brought, while listening to the birds singing in the surrounding mesquite trees and Mexican fan palms. Then, back for another lengthy, ahhhhh ..... so ...... relaxing soak in the clear hot water.  I know I'll definitely back for unwinding and recharging.

Make sure you call for reservations before going there. You can make an appointment for massage, too. And note ... depending on the bathing area you choose, you can soak in a bathing suit ... or au naturel ;-)",4
Local Flavor,Interesting place in the middle of the desert between AZ and CA.,3
Local Flavor,"this is my favorite secret hideaway.  the private areas are an amazing escape for the concrete jungle of central phoenix.

wonderfully rejuvenating - it makes me feel like i'm a robot getting plugged in to my power source.",5
Local Flavor,"Love this place.

Not much to look at but the tub and hot water over looking the desert is the bomb!

Recommend to anyone who loves hot springs.",4
Local Flavor,"This place is a hidden gem.  I am reluctant to write a review because the place is not crowded, but the water is so relaxing.  They say there are traces of lithium in the water which makes you feel so relaxed after soaking.  This place is by no means a resort, it reminds me of what a comune in the 60's may have been like, but the private areas are amazingly beautiful.  Again, this in not a resort and is very rustic.  However for $10 an hour it is definitelly worth the 50 mile drive.  I had the sunset area which is open to the desert.  Saddleback mountain is amazing, the dessert scenery is amazing.  Go here if you are not expecting the ritz carlton.",4
Local Flavor,"I love this place. It has a charm all its own, and when a good soaking is needed outside under the stars in AZ, this is one of my favorite respites. Thank you!",4
Local Flavor,"This place is a MUST SEE!! Look no further, you should go here!!! It was incredible you will love every detail of this wonderfull desert oasis paradise!!! I cannot say enough! a secret hideaway you will want to come back again and again and show to all your family and friends!!! Loved it so much!! Perfect Birthday celebration!!!",5
Local Flavor,Just spent the day at the Hot Springs-Brought my trailer and spent the night--A first time experience--Absolutely the most relaxing and comfortable -- WOW this place is great --Will be back again to enjoy the water -- Thanks-- Highly recommend,5
Local Flavor,This place rocks--visited Memorial day week-end-spent the night in my RV--the water and the soaking was the greatest--haven't felt this relaxed in ages--Highly recommend--will definitely be back to enjoy the water,5
Local Flavor,"I have visited the Hot Springs 5 times since first visiting on Memorial Day week-end 2012--This place rocks -- a perfect place to soak and forget the cares of the world--what a beautiful setting rustic, peacful--Highly recommend--the water is so soothing it's like soaking in pure sunshine--Don't miss out on a fantastic experience",5
Local Flavor,"Swinger, Nudist, Groupies, Couples, etc... this could be the place for you!!
My friend and I were going on a road trip to Arizona from California so we decided to make a pit stop here at El Dorado Hot Springs. 
Little did we know that we were in for a surprise. 

I'd probably agree with everyone that this place is very RUSTIC. 
Rustic Cars, Rustic Trees, Rustic Chairs, Rustic Hot Tub, Rustic Atmosphere.... just Rustic... and HOT. :)  

If you've been to hot springs or spas at a local resorts covered with beautiful trees, pools, towels, and drinks all around, this place is quite the opposite. 

We came here on a Friday Afternoon and was greeted by a very nice lady inside. 
I wanted to be spontaneous so didn't bother with looking in too deep with reviews or anything. I wanted to get a tour of this place, so the lady said that she can take me to the Corale hot springs (the first one you see when you walk in). 
It was nice, but i wanted to see more, but she said they were all occupied.. which is fine. Then I asked her if I can see the communal hotsprings, and she said... ""no, you have to be nude to see that one"". 
I was wide eyed at this point and said ""Ohhh, that okay!! we'll take the Corale"" 
it was only $10.00 an hour, Per Person! 
That deal doesn't get better than that. :) 

It was very relaxing.... (just close your eyes) lol. 
My friend and I couldn't help but laugh the whole time because we started reading the brochure and discovered that nudist people go here. You can rent the hot springs for all your friends from 9pm- 11am!!!  that's right.. 9PM to 11AM. 
there's also motels in the area for you with a hot tub included.  

All and all, this was a very relaxing place to hang out at even if you're not a nudist... er swinger. etc. Just hang out, have fun, and watch out for the gigantic dragonflies! I spent at least 45 minutes with my head half way in the water shooting at the dragonflies with the water hose. My friend was freaking out so she closed her eyes. 

when our hour was up, we exited and said our good byes to the nice lady. 
She says ""You girls sounded like you were having a lot of fun"". lol. 

a reminder for all: 
If you're going to come here, nudist or not, 
           - call ahead of time if you want to reserve a nice private spa. 
           - bring your own towel
           - bring your own water bottles
           - bring sunblock and sunglasses
           - bring your own bathing suit.... or Not! whatever makes you happy! 
but come here with an open mind. It's very relaxing.. promise! :)",4
Local Flavor,"Very lax place. Not much to look at, but awesome mineral bath. Felt amazing and I bet nighttime visit would be beautiful",4
Local Flavor,"I have been going to the El Dorado Hot Springs for years and always have a relaxing time. Open your minds and give it a try...you won't be sorry
Makes for a great ""day trip""....lets relax",5
Local Flavor,"I love this place  and I recommend it. When you first drive up it doesn't look like much but when you drive in, its really cute and cozy.    I came here this past weekend, January after new years .  The weather was absolutely perfect.  Reviews are right, you have to come here with an open mind.  We asked for a private area.  We got private little area with a fire-pit, and 2 relaxing lounge chairs, a shower and a stone hot tub with a fountain.  It was heavenly.   You feel amazing afterwards.  This is not like being in a jacuzzi. Its like taking a mineral bath and you will feel amazing afterwards.  The people "" snowbirds"" were very friendly.    It is very rustic so if you are not into that type of thing then this may not be for you but I loved it.  It was clean and really cute. After this bath, I never have felt so relaxed!.",5
Local Flavor,"We have been coming to Eldorado since 1994 and have always thought of it as a wonderful getaway in a rustic quiet and serene setting.  We have watched management come and go since Bill and Camilla left in 2005 and have had varied experiences since then, some better than others, BUT we have kept coming back because of the water.  We went yesterday for a 3-hour soak and left after 2 hours; why? water was not even close to warm enough and not enough flow.  No adjustments to flow were possible and much of time flow into Desert View tub was a strong, lukewarm trickle at best.  We really mis the old Eldorado and premium hot, clean water and have been willing to tolerate other issues, but not enough hot water gives us no reason to come back.",1
Local Flavor,"Congratulations to the El Dorado Hot Springs for being my first non-culinary Yelp review! You are a state gem, and more Phoenicians should partake in this oasis of relaxation.

Approximately an hour out from Downtown Phoenix, past Palo Verde Station, what nearly feels like half-way to Quartzite; is the town of Tonopah. Here, the El Dorado Hot Springs are a must get-away for the individual, couple, or even a group of friends! Run by a sweet, middle-age couple; they will serve as your guides into physical serenity.

Each hot tub, constructed solely of natural Arizona geology, is pouring forth with natural hot spring water. Each tub is in turn surrounded by a private enclosure that creates a private oasis reminiscent of the Pacific at the desert's door.

The prices are amazing; $10/hour or $50 for an overnight stay! Worth every dollar to stay, and every moment of the drive. I'll be making this diamond in the rough a routine ritual, and so should each of you.",5
Local Flavor,I have wanted to try this place out for a long time so I finally made the drive out this HOT Arizona morning 6-30-14 and it was 100% worth it. It isn't fancy or ritzy but very relaxing. Look past the run down appearance it has and realize what you are getting for $10. I spent an hour+ in the Desert View tub and released all my tension. I could see Saddle Mountain in the distance and the different birds flying around.,5
Local Flavor,AAAAAHHHHHHHHH..... SOOOOO NIIIIIICE!! I've been to several hot springs and this is one of my favorites. The owners are very friendly and have added their personality into the experience!,5
Local Flavor,"My wife and I have stopped here many times on the way home from a day trips to Quartzsite or just a day out 4 wheeling and rock collecting. It's always so nice to take a nice hot soak when its chilly out.
We've always taken a private soak in one of the completely 'walled in' pools but when I've been there alone I've used the 'public' area and it's also very nice but you can't be shy because it's a nude only area.
The pool we used is called 'the corral' it has a large pool,shower and a large old bath tub that could be filled and left to be a cooling off pool if you get too hot{easy to do!} it also had two lounge chairs and tables. It's a nice large area, I could see spending an afternoon there. 

I've never spent the night but I'd like to. Everybody I've talked with has always been very nice.",5
Local Flavor,"Road trip back from flagstaff to CA we stopped at the tonapah family diner for lunch and heard about this hot spring. Not even a mile away. We took a 2 hour soak got our own private ""Desert view"" they gave me 3 giant ice blocks for my claw foot tub to cool down in while we worked on erasing  our tan lines. I should have taken pictures but my phone got too hot- it is summertime in the desert! Great place to break up your trip, we will be back when it's cooler so we can fully appreciate a good long soak. Clean desert natural environment with ducks and even Tom the turkey. You can choose semi private  or private soaks, there's camping, room rentals, and workampers  are needed year round.",4
Local Flavor,"So I was having a very stressful time and just needed to get away and enjoy my time. I decided to book the desert view private spring for 3 hours for me and my girlfriend.  For only $15 an hour per person, was very cheap!

As other reviews on yelp state, this is not a high luxury spa, it's outdoors and in the middle of the desert.  It's definitely rustic and simple, but I think I liked that even more.  The staff were very warm and friendly. There were turkeys and chickens running around in the open lot, lol.  

The actual experience of the springs was perfect.  We were far enough out of town I didn't feel the fast pace of the city.  The springs were quiet, the water was so fresh and soft.  It was 3 hours of no stress and total relaxation.  I'm a massage therapist and can't even say how many massages I have received over the years and this felt more productive than most massages.

My gf and I had a great time and look forward to going again and again and again.",5
Local Flavor,"This place is amazing. If you're looking for luxurious, five star blah blah we probably can't be friends. This place was real, natural, simple, friendly, and after a weekend of physically and mentally strenuous work in Phoenix, it was exactly what I needed.
The staff was all very sweet, relaxed, and helpful. They have a few animals, including a sweet and adventurous kitten who came and kept me company in my room and while I soaked. In the morning I got to feed their peacocks (kitty food! Who would of thought?) and checked out the many chickens and Tom the turkey. 
I stayed in the Mariposa room for $50 for the night. It was simple and everything I needed; bed, fridge, AC, mirror, chairs, and a coffee maker. The private lounge area outside the room connected to the hot springs area where there were many tubs being filled with incredible,natural water. I soaked in both an overflowing claw foot bathtub (Shanghai Noon style!) as well as a larger, stone pool. It was perfect for relaxing and stretching. I spent some time cooling off after in my robe out in the lounge area looking up at the stars. 
There was some construction happening the next morning (starting around 10am) but it was far from bothersome. In fact, it felt more like a communal project, and I had the urge to offer to help in exchange for more time there. Another soak in the morning before hitting the road back to LA and this was definitely the best fifty bucks I've ever spent on the road.",5
Local Flavor,"Very simple, rustic fun. Everything was really clean and well kept. The tub was a little bit on the lukewarm side given the recent overnight low temps (but you can't change science). It's a little close to the highway, but you get over it and give into the experience. We brought drinks and a low volume boom box which was totally fine. The staff was very nice and welcoming. I'm excited to return for a camping trip.",5
Local Flavor,"Escape and de-stress! We had a lovely soak here. Simple, natural environment. I prefer this to the hoity toity natural mineral spas. I enjoyed the communal feel just like my native Arcosanti. The staff were all very sweet, helpful and welcoming. They have quite a few private soaking areas as well as public. 
  We were in a private area with a fire pit, lounge chairs, 6-8 person soaking tub and an area under the trees for a tent.
  We enjoyed the warm tub, the cool air and the stars! Next time it'll be an overnight stay!",5
Local Flavor,"The hot springs is rustic and inviting.  I have been here twice in the past week while vacationing in Phoenix. The first time I was there at sunset and I had the dessert view pool, which is a private room that opens up to the dessert, the staff was so friendly they
helped me build a fire, and I laid  in the hot tub enjoying  the fire and the stars looking out on the dessert. Did not think it could get any better than that. Well I just got back from the springs today. Took my brother who is handicapped. the staff told which one would be the best for him. It was perfect. I got a massage from Tina while I was there.
Amazing massage, I get massages wherever I go. and Tina ( body and Sole) will go down in my book as one of the best. If you get to spend a few hours at the springs. Get a massage from Tina you will be glad you did. But call ahead.enjoy enjoy",5
Local Flavor,"Very cool idea, was definitely more rustic than I expected but pretty cool vibe. The owners were very sweet, giving it less than 5 stars bc $15 PER PERSON per hour I think is pretty steep. For my husband and I to watch the sunset in a pool for 2 hrs was $60. Our next door neighbor was blasting music and it was pretty annoying since we were there to relax. Water wasn't ""hot"" it was warm enough though and I didn't get cold, which I often do in just warm water. Chairs and such we're pretty worn but hey, adds to the rustic feel. There was a funky smell that reminded me of a petting zoo but that could just be the desert. Sunset was great.",3
Local Flavor,"This place is amazing. If you're looking for luxurious, five star blah blah we probably can't be friends.

Local Flavor,"The key word is rustic, and if you're okay with that, then you will love this place!  It's out in the middle of nowhere and when you pull up front you may wonder what you got yourself into.  But once you get inside your own enclosure with your own private tub, you will be blown away.  Even though this is right off I-10, it's set back enough that you don't here any traffic and really feel like you're in the middle of nowhere.  We packed a picnic and booked our own private pool for a few hours and just hung out and relaxed. 

If you're feeling more adventurous, there are semi-private and group pools as well.  Note that clothing is optional!",4
Local Flavor,"Happy to say we gave El Dorado another chance yesterday.  The place is under new management, water was very comfortable, place was cleaned up and had much more of a mellow feel like it used to have.  So happy to be able to report this",4
Local Flavor,Love this place! Simple and very welcoming. Stopped in for an hour on our way into Phoenix. Can't wait to stop on our way back home. Exactly what this tired mama needed. Already making plans to come back for an overnight stay.,5
Local Flavor,"I've been coming up here for almost twenty years. Everyone on here says ""rustic."" That is not a bad thing, not at all. The whole point in coming to a place like this is that it is not a resort setting.

The best part about the place is that, although it is amazingly easy to get to from the freeway, it is far enough off of the main drag in Tonopah that it is quiet. The loudest sound you'll hear is the running water and the birds.

The semi-private area is the only one where you'll encounter strangers. I've never found anyone to be pushy or intrusive, however. Folks are pretty respectful and friendly.

There are some new staff there since the last time I came by. Very friendly.

One caveat: back in December, I took a friend up there thinking that the springs would be great on a cold winter day. I didn't think about how the water had been sitting all night with only a trickle to replenish it. As our time wore on and we displaced enough water that the tub filled with fresh, hot water, it got better.",5
Local Flavor,"Rustic.  How rustic?  The kind of rustic that had me chasing small, friendly goats out of the enclosure when I forgot to latch the door.  The staff is super friendly (at least as friendly as the goats), the water is amazing, and the private enclosures, rustic as they undoubtedly are, are lovely.  Mine had an unbeatable view of the desert and I really wish I could have stayed for sunset.  I also highly recommend getting a massage, something I'm super picky about, because the therapist is completely amazing.

If you come expecting a fancy spa, you'll be disappointed, but if you like mineral springs, the desert and a friendly (yeah, there's that word again), unpretentious  clothing optional environment, this is the place to be.",5
Local Flavor,"Great prices with public and private pools, camping and such gorgeous landscaping that adds to the relaxation from the waters there. Friendly, helpful staff and just all around great!",5
Local Flavor,"I had not been here in many years, so long ago Bill and Camila (sp) owned it and the entire resort past the gate was open to nudity. The ""new"" owners are Julia and Matt and they are doing a wonderful job from what I can see. It is more family friendly and only one place for nudity called Pete's Place near the front. There is a sign for just about everything and I proved an old adage, that habits are stronger than words (or signs). Everyone was very friendly, helpful and understanding. One resident Willis was very helpful to me, running an errand to the local truck stop and filling me in on the resort.

There were a few temporary things that the management is doing their best to work out. There are some horse flies that are apparently coming from a new chicken farm up the road. The flies, at least on my part, only bothered me in the shade, and it was only a nuisance at that. Second, there are bees that come and go and are currently attracted to PVC piping in the nude community area. The old adage, live and let live applies - if you don't bother them, they won't bother you. It was a pretty busy Sunday afternoon with no incident.

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. In some ways Julia and Matt have done a too good of job - I overstayed my visit by about 5 hrs!

P.S. If you are not into the community nakedness, there are around 6 private tubs to enjoy.",4
Local Flavor,"Great little getaway that makes you feel like you left Phoenix, but really it's super close. We spent an hour in a private bath and it was very nice and relaxing! Call ahead to reserve a spot.",5
Local Flavor,"My wife and I used to love this place - we've probably been here 5-10 times and always had a good time.  Our last visit was quite the opposite, unfortunately.

The first thing that hit us was the bad smell from the recently opened Hickman's Poultry Plant that's nearby... and the flies that came with it.  The lady that checked us in apologized about it and said on some days it's good and on some days it's bad, and that seems true - the evening we arrived, the smell permeated the entire outdoor area (thankfully, our cabin didn't smell).  The next morning, it was fine.  The flies were pretty bad though the entire time - we probably killed about 40 of them the first night in the cabin.

Then, it turned out our cabin (Motel California) had a pretty bad ant problem.  We first ran into them around the tub outside our cabin.  It was dark so we didn't see them, and had no idea until they bit us a whole bunch.  Because at first you don't realize you're getting bit by ants - you think your skin is just dry and itchy.  It's not until your whole backside lights up and turns into welts that you realize something is amiss.  By the morning, the ants found our food inside the cabin and got all over it, including the surrounding clothes, bags, etc.  We basically spent the morning cleaning them off and decided to leave sooner than we had planned.

To top it all off, our car alarm went off in the middle of the night.  It did the same in the morning, which is when we found a peacock perched on the hood, and a sizable turkey fleeing the scene.

We tried really hard to make it work - when we got bit by the ants on one side of the tub we moved to the other side, and going on fly killing sprees was kinda fun (the cabin came with a fly swatter).  But all in all, this is probably the worst experience we have ever had staying somewhere.  Two stars because the place used to be great, and because the staff is still trying to make it work.  It's unfortunate that some of the problems (like the Hickman's Poultry Plant) are outside their control.

If you do plan to come out here, you may want to come on a day with wind blowing towards the poultry plant.  Or reserve the Post Office, which has an indoor tub. Also, if your car has an alarm, you may want to park outside the property.

Finally, if you do run into the lovely effects of the poultry plant, you may want to file a complaint about the plant with the Maricopa County Environmental Services Department (http://www.maricopa.gov/EnvSvc/Complaints/Forms/ComplaintForm.aspx).  I can't imagine what it's like to residents that have to deal with that day after day.",2
Local Flavor,"What a nice weekend. This is one of those rare places you get lucky to find. Authentic, rustic and enchanting.  Quiet and serine.  Private soaks or communal soaks.  Incredibly clean - ownership has pride!  For RV'ers: good, clean electric and easy pull-in and out.  Close to diesel.   We will be back!!",5
Local Flavor,"This place is so wonderful! My family and I have been soaking here for years and it's now part of our family traditions. 
I like that they have a variety of soaking areas and that their pools are different temperatures so you can have exactly the experience you want. They range from mid 90s at Desert View and their hottest is the Corral at 106.
We love being able bring wood and build a fire by the pool in several of their sites. Their RV parking/camping option is an especially sweet deal because you can park your rig/pitch your tent and soak to your hearts content for one fee.",5
Local Flavor,"Went for a soak there for the first time on New Years Eve at mid day. Facilities and tubs were funky fun but unfortunately the air was thick with foul (fowl) odor from the newly built Hickman Egg Factory 1/2 mile upwind to the west. Later after researching I found out the whole community of Tonapah was blindsided by the building of this huge facility with 2.2 million birds presently and up to 8 million to come with expansion. 
   We built a fire to keep the smells at bay and enjoyed the water, but my heart goes out to the owners and their future prospects of success with their new neighbor. At least it was too cold  to have to deal with the hordes of flies that I heard stories of....",3
Local Flavor,Very cute and a reasonable price! I will be coming again. Gorgeous views as well! I recommend renting a Private pool,5
Local Flavor,"We've been long time patrons. It's possible we've been going here for over 17 years. It's always been a respite from a hectic life. Nothing is finer than soaking it natural hot springs on a cloudless winter day. We actually love the rustic charm and find the funkiness of the whole place inviting. However, on our most recent visit the water in Desert Vista was noticeably cooler than usual. The water was warm but not hot. This is obviously a disturbing change and we are wondering if the Hickman operation is stealing away water from the hot water table. The staff let us leave earlier than out allotted time but I feel we should have been warned or given a discount as this is sadly an unnerving change after so many wonderful years of soaking. I hope the situation gets resolved with perhaps a new or deeper well but soaker beware of the changes.",3
Local Flavor,"Let's go to onsen next, said my BFF. I was thinking flying to California.. Didn't know just a little over one hour drive, we have hot springs in Arizona.

She made a reservation at the sunset hot springs for two hours, and it was just perfect amount of time for us. They said they have clothing optional semi private area as well as some private areas. The sunset was perfect size for 2-4 people, three of us really enjoyed relaxing moment.

As other reviewers said, the word ""rustic"" describes this place so perfectly. Nothing fancy, middle of nowhere. It was $15 per person per hour. 

It turned out both my BFF and I were having high stress from work, experiencing difficulty sleeping, this trip was just what we needed. We talked and laughed, while soaking our bodies in hot springs. Our body and mind were so refreshed by the end of two hours here.

My girlfriend said she would come back here again next weekend with her mom. I definitely want to come back again at the next opportunity, whenever it might be.",4
Local Flavor,"They sold these Frequent Soaker Cards for like $100.  I had one I barely used and they told me they wouldn't honor it cause they've got counterfeits out there.   Not my issue, them taking  my $ and saying they have a problem with fakes out there.  While it's a pretty cool place to visit, I feel very ripped off.  And the workers, caring or not, only work there, manage the place or own it.  It's bad business.  The cards are easy enough to counterfeit.  So I can see where could could have created a problem for themselves.  To ask their loyal patrons to make up for their poor business practice only exacerbates the concern.",1
Restaurants,"Our lunch was good, service was good, the view across the lake and the golf couse....brilliant!",4
Restaurants,Do not ever eat the food there. We live in WBV and have tried the restaurant a couple times to give it a chance. It's awful no matter what you order off the menu. It's a nice place to have a drink and a nice view but that's it.,1

Restaurants,"Had dinner and enjoyed The Blues Brothers  Show last Saturday. Service was great,show was fun,the food was really good, A great turnaround from last year. Plan on returning soon",5
Restaurants,"Went on a drive last fall with the parents and stopped in here. Cute little diner with a very friendly staff.  The food was good and we all enjoyed our meals.   One of the waitresses noticed our dog in the car and offered us some water to give her, nice touch.",4
Restaurants,"Apparently the new owner has trouble keeping employees.  The cook had not shown up in two days so the owner (who is not a cook) was cooking.  The server made it obvious to us that she did not like the owner or her ability to cook.   Service was not good, food was ...ok. Was charged extra for fries with sandwich instead of potato salad, but server never mentioned it was a dollar more.  That info was hidden in the tiny fine print on a different page of the menu from the sandwiches.  The bathroom was even dirty so I guess the dishwasher quit too. 

Disappointed in the total down grade of the place.",1
Restaurants,"I've eaten a few times here. The service is always good and the food has always been excellent.

I especially like the deserts always fresh and unique.

Thanks for the great food.",4
Restaurants,"Average everyday bar, with a ton of car parts and pictures around. The staff was friendly, and they have a cool little game room area upstairs with couches and bar games. The food I had was your typical bar food.",3
Restaurants,"Came here for lunch one day because my car broke down and I had to get it fixed at the car shop next door!

The place is crowded with race car/motorcycle memorabilias! Their burgers were good...the fries were good...kinda typical bar and grill place...like Dennys...maybe better but not as great as Chilis!",3
Restaurants,"15 miles from the Las Vegas strip this place claims to have Iowa Pork Tenderloin Sandwiches and since it's been more than 5 years 
since we had one we were determined to make the drive. When we arrived it looked very promising a large crowd was gathering next door for the car show and once we entered the place had a very cool atmosphere with 
TV's on every wall,classic 50's 
boothes and all kinds of car memorabilia. Plus 
theres a bar & game room upstairs. There was no wait & plenty of seating when we arrived at 6:00 pm. After we were seated , 20 minutes later a teenage waitress came to take our drink order, 20 minutes later she came back with the drinks and took our order. We ordered 4 sliders,Fried Cheese, Pork Tenderloin & Country Fried Steak Sandwiches. A little pricier than the menu we had found on the 
interent but still fairly reasonable. While we waited for our appetizer we saw several disgruntled patrons complaining about the slow service & leaving. After an hour of waiting we still had NOT seen our waitress for a refill or explanation. There were at most 30-40 patrons in the place at this time. The people sitting across from us had to have waited 20 minutes for there bill and finally a 
waitress brought them every unpaid check and asked which one was theirs, the man left exact cash for the check & voiced quite loudly to no one in particular he wasn't leaving any damn tip-for what? On 2 
occasions while we were waiting with our EMPTY glasses on the edge of the table as a CLEAR sign we needed MORE to drink the waitresses would turn tail and run before they made eye contact and had to DO THEIR JOB!! Finally fed up with waiting for NO APPARENT REASON we decided to give up and go somewhere that actually serves their customers. We approached the waitress to find out what the problem was she laughed & said ""it's crazy in here"" with no apology or explanation for the ABSURDLY long wait. HELL we've waited an HOUR to get into a place with NO problem but an HOUR to see your waitress after you've ordered-NEVER and we eat out 3-4 times a week! To say it was BAD service is an understatement. We never had a chance to try any of the food but without a doubt there was NO way it would have been good enough to compensate for the 
atrocious service. The only way I would recommend this place is if it were FREE & they were POURING booze down your throat while you wait. IF you are looking for a disrespectful smart mouthed teenager to give you SHIT this is your kind of place. BUT if you expect to get what your paying for Quality Food & Service you MOST definitely will NOT find it here.",1
Restaurants,"Well my last visit here to get the Iowa Pork tenderloin Sandwich was a total disaster so I planned ahead and brought the phone number with me so when I was in the area I could call in a takeout order.

I ordered the Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with onion,pickles and mustard $8.99+tax

They said 10 minutes I was there in 5 it was hot & ready.

Just like I remember- years ago in Iowa when I last had one.

Crispy and juicy, larger than life. I hardly had 2 bites and my son was so enticed he had to ""have a go"" at it and he couldnt stop himself he wanted his own so we sat in the parking lot eating one while waiting on another for the road.

Cool fun atmosphere but the service is suspect, even with my takeout it was 6pm on a Saturday night -NFL playoffs -the bar was dead and only 1 small group in the diner.Open 24 hours a day.

Great hard to find sandwich, a little pricy but HHAGG wants $14 for a pork tenderloin sandwich. Next on the list.",4
Restaurants,"I can honestly say that I've never sat in the restaurant section of this place.  However, I can attest to the view from the inside of the bar!  Hot Rods has quickly become my favorite place to go after work with collegues and friends alike to de-stress from the day and get a little blitz'd.  Happy Hour from 4 to 7pm makes for a good time.  Finger foods half off, cheap beer and discounted shots are all on the menu.

The bartenders are pretty good eye candy for men and women alike.  They're friendly, will make you some wild-ass shots and are attentive.

Word of warning to the non-smokers out there...if you can't hang with the smell, stay out of the bar.  I smoke off and on, and it doesn't bother me, but it seems like there isn't a soul in the bar that doesn't smoke, so prepare to walk into the cloud and leave smelling like a Marlboro factory reject.

Best part about this place?!?!?  IT'S A CHARGER BAR!!!!  woo hoo!  I'm in love.",4
Restaurants,"Well I am thinking it was this place in 2003. Our friends took us here for a good time. What a disaster. There were cars on the ceiling and all around. I remember that the food was absolutely horrendous. Not just is was ridiculously bad. I really am trying to find out whether this is the name of this place. I remember walking outside after in between big buildings or walls or something. I also remembered how our friends could take us to such a crappy place when there are so many half decent recents to eat. As Doctor Phil would say "" what were they thinking?"" . Any help appreciated. I need to post this place or whatever the name of it was  on my top 10 or top 5 worst meals ever . It was that bad. I would not even give it a 1/5 if was like  -5.",1
Restaurants,"This was my 3rd time here. Another food trip inspired by a restaurant.com $25 gift certificate.

We arrived at 7pm Friday night and the parking lot was fairly full but once we entered the dining room was empty-everyone was in the bar.

We asked to sit upstairs in the game room and it was empty to. We had it all to ourselves....or so we thought.

They have 2 pool tables,fooseball,pinball, racing,hunting and a jukebox plus a big screen with 3 couches to lounge and a 100""+ projection screen for events,etc.

There's also a small bar upstairs but the waitresses do have to run up & down the stairs for soft drinks & food.

We ordered drinks & some cheeseburger sliders for an appetizer. Then we all ordered sandwiches and a steak.

My son got the Teriyaki Swiss burger with fries, my wife got the Turkey Bacon Club and I got the  Mustang Melt-an 8oz New York with bleu cheese and bacon bits.

Before the food arrived a group of 10-12 kids and their parents arrived to add some life to the place. The kids were all well-behaved and excitedly enjoying all the games.

The service was great, the food however was just ok. The hamburger taste like frozen patties flavorless & dry -not at all good. The turkey club was great and the steak was enjoyable but the bleu cheese & bacon wasn't necessary the steak would have been better without it.

I was a little disappointed they didn't have the california-style  tuna melt that used to be on the menu (http://www.menusearch.net/lasvegas/restaurant.php?name=570)

I will buy another GC @ restaurant.com but I will stay away from the burgers and stick to the pork tenderloin.",3

We have eaten everything from the appetizers, to the delicious cheese tortellini (that could rival many of the high priced strip restaurants).",4
Restaurants,"+1 for the restaurant.com-inspired visit, same as prior reviewer.

We took some friends here for a bite to eat.  The dinner salads were nothing to order again, but the rueben was quite good.  You have to know what to order at a place like this.  You can't ask too much, because it's basically a bar that also has a restaurant attached.  

It's weird inside - lots of car parts & all patrons are in the glassed-off bar portion.  You will be the only party eating.  On the upside, even a very limited waitperson can take care of 1 table quite competently.

I have nothing bad to say about this place, but the 4-star rating takes the discounted price into consideration.",4

yes it does look like a grandma living room but I also win money every time I go in there the drinks are comped and they have great snacks it doesn't matter what time of the day or who's on shift they are always super friendly and welcoming",5

I called the gaming control board at 1-775-684-7700 and its the law they must pay. If they refuse hold onto the voucher and call gaming and file a complaint against them. Lets all see that this freak show closed.,1

I've been to the Government Center before when I had to go to an office for some business.  Parking is great and the building is interesting, inside and out.",4
Public Services & Government,"This place is huge and can be extremely hard to find anything. Simply ask any security for directions and they will happily take you to your destination. Parking is located right in front of the main entrance off of grand central, make sure you park in visitors parking which is the smaller lot. The huge lots surrounding are all for govt employees and I believe you will get ticketed or towed. If you are here as a new hire and need badging done, take the freight elevator down to the basement and follow the yellow footsteps to your destination!",5

I forget the lady's name that we always seem to get, but she's from the Philippines and she's 1/2 black!  But she's always so nice.  We wouldn't even have to go down there, but it's never a big deal, it's not like it's a long wait.  Plus my husband loves to drive, so it's all good!",5
Public Services & Government,"Having lived all over the country and having to deal with a variety of State and local government services, I think Clark County has cracked the code.  Contrasted with the Nevada DMV (probably the worst of any state I've lived in, and I've lived in 11 of them since I started driving--yikes!), the Government Center is a dream.  Lines don't exist or are usually very short, and the people I've dealt with are always pleasant and helpful.

The location is great:  centrally located and very easy to get to, and there's lots of parking.  If you're there around lunchtime or at the end of the workday, it's very easy to finish your biz at the Center, then roll right into the Arts District or Downtown LV for a bite to eat or to meet friends at your favorite restaurant or bar.  Feel the need to shop after your visit to the Center?  The outlet mall is right there too.  And the Discovery Children's Museum and Smith Center are close by as well.  If you're a fan of First Fridays, they make their ample (and free!) parking lot available.  Park your car at the Government Center and take the free shuttle over to the First Friday fun and games.

If you're looking for a nice chill atmosphere to kick back with your friends this is the place. The prices aren't bad as well.

Aside from the gambling, they offer pool tables darts and other non gambling games for your enjoyment. The always friendly and attentive staff is lead by Victoria and they are all great! It is definitely a place where they remember your name. Angelina's, the connecting restaurant, offers their menu and full service bar side. There are other places similar to Putters in the surrounding area, but this by far should be your go to neighborhood bar.",5
Restaurants,"All I can say is, wow...Ruby Tuesday has really reinvented itself since I last went to one a year or so ago.  Their menu has completely changed from all burgers, steaks, and deep fried appetizers to something a little lighter, a litter fresher, and a little more up my ally.  

Now, I'm not one for franchised family restaurants where screaming children and horribad decor can be found around any corner, but the guy wanted to show me his new office in Summerlin, it was late, and it was open.

I sat down very discouraged...what would I eat?  And then I spotted their Fresh Combinations section.  Quiche?  Mozzarella and tomato salad?  What?  I ended up getting the mini turkey burgers, subbing the fries for the mozzerella and tomato salad I spotted with the quiche, and the garden bar instead of the caesar salad.  

Even their salad bar seems to have really improved.  Edamame and a myriad of other whole beans, many fresh lettuces, many neat salads (the green bean and red pepper salad, very refreshing!)  Of course all the standard salad bar fare is there too...don't worry!  And they had avocado ranch...it was green and lumpy and I could TASTE the avocado in it.

We also ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer, subbing celery sticks in for tortilla chips.  It was totally delicious and a great compliment with the fresh, crisp, baby celery hearts they gave us.

I was shocked, pleased, and very satisfied by the time we left.  Hopefully we'll stop by again for lunch if I'm ever in Summerlin to see guy during work.",4
Restaurants,"My girlfriend wanted to eat here since we've seen the commercials down in So Cal. Now I have eaten at a Ruby Tuesday before in Cleveland, OH, and I thought this one would be the same as its midwestern counterpart. Wow, this Ruby Tuesday was completely different. From the outside it looked like a Cocos or Sizzler. The Ruby Tuesday in Cleveland looked and felt like an upscale Chilis but with a better menu. They even had Stella Artois (my favorite beer) on tap!

The service here was okay at best, but the food was disappointing, especially after having an amazing experience at another RT. If you want to eat at a Ruby Tuesday, you might as well go to one in the midwest. Stay away from this one.",2
Restaurants,"It is kinda crappy that I live in SoCal and see their juicy commercials, but know that the closest one to me is in LAS VEGAS!!!! My grandparents live a couple miles away from this location, and It is a must visit if your in Vegas. If it is your last day in Vegas, take a last small side trip to Ruby Tuesday and go home satisfied. 

The homies and I always mob this place before we leave Vegas. They have a full bar if you want to get tipsy before you leave Vegas (as a passenger!)

There burgers are pretty worth the trip (especially buffalo burgers) and their food and service is great as well.

Another FREEBIE for joining the E-Club. FREE Handcrafted Gourmet Burger!!

I decided to try the Boston Bleu-Burger cooked medium with bleu cheese & steak sauce made with Sam Sdams Boston Lager!!

yeah...sounds good don't it!!

BEST damn burger I've ever had!!! I almost lost a finger!!

Prices are reasonable $8.99 burger, looks like a real cool place to eat and a small bar too. Only thing is just 2 locations both in NE/NW Las Vegas.

If you haven't checked this place out DON'T WAIT!!",5
Restaurants,"I love this place. I was so glad to find one in West Covina not exactly close, but a lot closer then VEgas. The burgers are always fresh, hot, and juicy. They have the best turkey burger i've ever had. Turkey can get so dry. The hot wings are better then good. The salad bar is fresh with a wide selection of salad selections. Its very reasonably priced. JOe always gets the steak which is actually pretty good. But remember its a hamburger restaurant",5
Restaurants,"I don't know what is up with this Ruby's. I have had very good experiences at other locations but from now on I avoid this one. 

The server never came back to check on us, I asked for my burger medium rare and it was well done, and the waiter kept making weird comments to people at our table. For the price of the meal I would have been better off staying home and wouldn't have had to put up with such awful service.",1
Restaurants,"Their bison burger LITERALLY took my breath away.. I seriously had respiratory problems after one bite, it was so weird. And I didn't mention it to anyone else at my table until I saw that they were grimacing uncomfortably, then I asked ""am I the only one having a hard time breathing?"" They all said they were having the same problem! Weird! I wonder if it is a common thing when you eat bison?

Anyways.. nice restaurant in the outskirts of Vegas. Had to try it while I was there because there are none in the Bay Area (only in the greater Northern CA area.. boo). Ordered several appetizers, burgers and drinks.

-spinach artichoke dip: I like BJ's better
- mozarella and tomato salad: can't really mess that up
- bison burger: a nice lean meat sandwiched between thick buttered bread and accompanied by fresh veggies. a must try
- white cheddar mashed potatoes: i LOVE white cheddar so this was a nice surprise
- bacon & cheese fries: the star of the show! loved it
- zero proof strawberry lemonade: carbonated but good. could have done without the carbonation

The other nearest location to me is Folsom, CA. Luckily I have family there so I can make it another excuse to visit them and eat :)",4
Restaurants,"Not one bad visit to this location and we've been coming here since we moved here, roughly 5 yrs. 

On our most recent visit we ordered:
$4.58- 2 Iced Teas 
$13.99- *Tuesday Special; Steak & Lobster with broccoli & baked potato
$17.99-*Tuesday Special; Steak & Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese with broccoli & mashed potato
$5.98-*Price is add-on to meal, 2 Salad Bar Buffet

We were seated and greeted right away. Our server took our order and checked on us, often. Service was good, nothing spectacular.

We then headed over to the Salad Bar. Very clean! We just recently went some where and I had major complaints about their salsa bar which was 'EW!' so it was quite refreshing to visit a place that kept up with their serve yourself thingie majig! I liked their selection of greens, iceberg, romaine, spinach and mixed greens. Dressings were OK, nothing I haven't tried before.

My steak was med-rare, hubster's was rare. It was seasoned well but one tid bit, it's a cheap cut so it tastes better cooked rare. Although my steak was still a little pink, it was really chewy, not fun for my jaw. Hubs enjoyed lobster, although a little over cooked it was still a deal! My Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese had flavor but I guess they stick the MnC under the salamander bc the lobster that was exposed was dry and chewy but the lobster within the MnC was still moist. Only thing I was disappointed in was their broccoli, it's probably the simplest item in this meal and it was way over cooked, borderline mushy.

The usual good experience, it'd been awhile since we'd been here but nothing has changed, still the same ole good experience :)",4
Restaurants,"While John's (our server) performance was impeccable, I doubt we'll be returning any time soon. My crab cake was VERY fishy tasting and Tuesday's only offered a very blah cocktail sauce - no teriyaki, soy or other flavor masker. My bride's chicken fresco was noticeably dry and her favorite vegetable, steamed broccoli, was not warm enough to melt the ""butter"" that John served after being asked for it. Her mashed cauliflower (which she couldn't bring herself to insist I try) was ""not quite what I remember"".

We didn't partake of the salad bar ... it was nicely presented but compared to Dessey's or a Sizzler it was seriously lacking.

Bottom line, if we get another ($10 max) 2 for 1 coupon we might return for a (see previous ratings) highly rated turkey burger. On the other hand, In-N-Out  is hard to resist when it come to burgers.

BTW, I'm glad we didn't take the (5 & 13) kids with us. There was nothing that would have appealed to them on the menu and we'd have had to stop at McDonald's to feed them later.",2
Restaurants,"Ruby's is really close by, so we come here fairly often. Especially when there are coupons floating around, which there usually are. We generally like having dinner here, and tonight was especially good. 

I ordered my usual glass of wine and my favorite RT dinner - the crabcake.  I order broccoli and mashed as my two sides.  I like that the broccoli doesn't have anything added, and isn't too raw or too well done:  as Baby Bear says, it's just right.  That helps atone for the crabcake, which is probably drenched in butter.  It's really good.

My husband had the sliders and salad bar.  It's on the lunch menu, but is available at dinner, too, for a few bucks more.  Two beef sliders (with fries or any side of your choice) and all-you-can-eat salad bar for, I think 9.99.  

I like Ruby Tuesday's burgers, too, but their most recent menu incarnation now has two different qualities of meat available.  In the very old days, Ruby's burgers were awful.  I used to order them sometimes because I knew I'd never have to pay for the meal, since I'd invariably send them back and complain.  Then, a few years ago, they went more upscale and the burgers were top shelf and fabulous.  I don't think I've had a burger at Ruby's since they switched to the A and B burgers, just sliders, but since I discovered their crab cake, that's what I usually order.

I love the fact that their drinks are reasonably priced - $5 for cocktails with their house brand liquors, which are decent quality.  The drink, though, depends on which bartender at which RT happens to be mixing that night.  I've been at Ruby Tuesdays all across the country, and it sure can vary.

Our server, Raymie, was very friendly and efficient, though I was surprised she never heard of Yelp! 

But the best part of our dinner was that -  ta-dah - none of the servers were running the infernal carpet sweepers back and forth!  This process was going on at every single Ruby Tuesday's I've ever been in, be it Las Vegas, New Jersey, Indiana, Tennessee, everywhere. And it didn't matter if it was 7 pm or near closing.  It was so annoying and pervasive that I emailed corporate (with no response), and then called.  Their curt answer:  ""That's the way they do things.""  Maybe others have finally complained, or maybe the rain made all the servers sluggish and lazy tonight, but finally we had a meal without that damned ""Whirrrrrrr."" 

May it continue in 2011.",4
Restaurants,"This is an easy review , I go twice a month with my wife & kids . Simple menu , kid friendly , really outstanding and quick service. Magnificent salad bar , tasty beers . Just great , not fancy , just great value and super for a family.",5
Restaurants,"We went by there tonight, and it was CLOSED!, so sad after 10 years in Summerlin, they are gone.",5
Restaurants,Great service. Excellent prices with unbelievable portion sizes. The salad bar is fantastic.,5
Restaurants,"It's now closed! waaaaaah , Corporate BS.",5
Restaurants,"This is really the tale of two bars.  

The positive is that drinks are cheap and the food is pretty good.  I've had few things in my stops there and I haven't been disappointed by food yet.  The wings are fantastic, the sandwhichs are filling, and the sides are tasty.  

I go here when i'm waiting my girlfriend to get home from work on mondays and the bartender monday sucks running.  She can't focus on more than one task at once and therefore is constantly flustered which makes for an uncomfortable air in the bar area. I've witnessed one of her meltdowns actually clear a pretty full bar.  Dear owner, this trainwreck is costing you money...you might want to consider upgrading staff.

The times she hasn't been there and a capable staffmember has been working has produced fun experiences.  That said, given the location it is what it is:  a yinzer bar bordering a less than desireable area of town and has everything that comes with it.",2
Restaurants,I have practically grown up eating Stroll Inn Sicilian cut pizza.   It was always a treat to get. I remember when I was younger as soon as I would see my dad carrying the white - pizza - no label box - I knew it was Stroll Inn. The pizza has changed over the years.. still delicious.   No delivery - only pick up - but it's worth it.,4
Restaurants,"Hands down best pizza in Pittsburgh, and the drinks are cheap. It's been a staple of the area for over 50 years. They must be doing something right!",5
Restaurants,"Been coming here for more than 25 yrs started back with my grand mother, then my parents, now I go there with my own family... 
     We always start out with beer,,,,cheesy bread sticks, then the pizza with pepperoni and pepper rings ...really good... But other food is pretty good also... also have to try the wings... 
      The wait staff are area girls tryin to raise some cash so I don't rip on them so much..
      During lent I'm pretty sure they have fish specials on Friday..",4
Restaurants,"My son and I stopped in for lunch after hitting a bucket of balls at the driving range down the street. 

I had a grilled chicken wrap with fries. He had the 1/2 pizza with pepperoni.  

The pizza is Old Forge style with a sweet tomato sauce.  

Nice staff and steady refills on my lemonade. 

We both liked it and would come again.",4
Restaurants,"Another late night option if you're hungry at 1am. I find most of the food here pretty good. The quesadillas are really tasty, but sometimes the cheese isn't melted all the way through... The burgers are good, but tend to take awhile. Smoothies are really good as well, but they always run out of ingredients early in the day. I guess smoothies for breakfast is on everyone's list.",4
Restaurants,"The tacos were cold and the dude was sketchy.  I probably could have told this just by looking but I had gotten lost on my way to ginger's and was hungry.

At least it was cheap.",2
Restaurants,Si Senor is not my favorite taco option. I got a steak taco and the bit of steak was so little my meat was about the size of a quarter. I could hardly believe how little meat I had.   I ate here because in the summer they have an outside food stand at the USX tower.  I remember being out of the taco that wanted.  So whenever a food venture is out of something that I want that immediately knocks off some starts for me.  The salsa options were great but I dare say Qdoba is better then this place.,2
Restaurants,"I just had a hugh take home ribs, greens and Mac cheese dish. It is the first yummy god like this I have had in Pittsburgh. Very very good",4
Restaurants,"Soul Food Connection is the absolute real deal! Great food and good people in an honest independently owned location. I love the fried chicken, black eyed peas and greens. Go there! It's take out mainly but you can eat there if you like.",5
Restaurants,"Got a 10pc fried chicken family meal w/ collards, yams, and four rolls for about $16. Food was excellent, staff was friendly. I plan to return after realizing it's a short walk.",4
Restaurants,"If you haven't had fried chicken at the soul food connection then you haven't had fried chicken.  They cook it up like they invented it!

Expect steaming moist crispy perfectly spiced breasts and wings, tender corn bread to soak up the sauce, and gooey baked Mac and cheese to show you how it's meant to taste.

While many soul food spots are just rib shacks with a grill, a counter, and bare walls, this has plenty of seating, jazz posters, cozy wallpaper and framed newspaper articles about their well deserved success.  It's owned by a very friendly couple whose kindness and love for the customers can be tasted in every bite.  After soul food, I normally get the itis and have a coma/siesta, but after lunch here I felt awake and energized!  A clear testament to their natural ingredients and home made recipes.

Why not 5 stars?  To me, greens and bbq ribs are the pinnacle of soul food.  The collared greens didn't taste freshly made and the ribs were good, but not great.  Smokey but a little dry and the sauce was too mild and light bodied for my taste.  Still, for catering or BBQ, you can get 50 chicken pieces for under $50 and no one does fried chicken or hospitality with more soul than the soul connection!",4
Restaurants,"I love their food I get the fried chicken wings, yams & green beans!! delicious. I eat there all the time!!!!",5
Restaurants,"I ate here the other day, it was delicious! I had fried chicken, collard greens mixed with cabbage ( awesome) & black eye peas. I brought a fried chicken home  for my daughter, she also loved it. The owner is very friendly & so are the customers. I would go back.",5
Restaurants,Stopped in yesterday for the first time and I must say I'll return before I leave Pittsburgh,4
Restaurants,"So food-wise, this place is amazing.  All of the traditional soul food classics with amazing flavor.  When I'm craving fried chicken or fish, mac and cheese and collard greens? This is the spot.  Plus the staff/owners are lovely to interact with. Slow, but lovely.

But good grief do they need to do repairs to the restaurant itself!  It's hard to ignore the peeling wall paper and crumbling ceiling, not to mention that there is an odor when you walk in the door.  Best bet is to call ahead so the food is ready to be paid for and picked up as soon as you get there.",4
Restaurants,"I stopped in here while on a previous business outing in the area.  It's another one of those no frills, no surprises places that's got good solid food.  I remember the chicken Italian hoagie here and how it was maybe two steps above what you get at Subway.",3
Restaurants,"Really old place, even the people who grew up nearby can't remember when they opened. It could use a make over, but honestly they are doing everything else right so really who cares - the steak and egg sandwiches are amazing. Get the small, its still enough for 2 people. Every time I go to Pittsburgh I have lunch here as often as possible. I've even managed to eat lunch twice on a few occasions!",4
Restaurants,"What a great place for a sandwich. We get the mushroom cheese steak with egg. Awesome. Better than anywhere. The place has a charm about it. Food is excellent. The food is what it's all about, right?
 Go there you will make it a regular stop.",5
Restaurants,"Braddock Hills sub shop shut down

May 7, 2016 8:13 AM
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
The Braddock Hills restaurant Rudy's Submarines has been ordered closed following a series of violations, the Allegheny County Health Department announced this morning.

On Thursday, the restaurant's health permit was suspended because it lacked a certified food protection manager, had neither a handwashing sink in the food preparation area nor hot water and soap, and had no date-marking equipment. Counters were not properly cleaned and sanitized, and the floor and ceiling were in poor condition, according to the Health Department.

On Friday, the Yost Boulevard eatery was found to be operating in spite of the closure order. So a second order has been issued, and a red closure placard placed on the front door.",1
Restaurants,"Stopped here spur of the moment, glad I did.
It was a Monday night around 7, the bar was pretty full and about half of the tables were, also. Nice, Clean place. It was Yuengs and Wings Night. Buy a Yuengling for $1.35 and get a pound of wings for free. Hard to beat. I had 2 Yuengs, one order of free wings and an order of Potato Skins. Total $5.69, hahaha. The wings were really good, one piece(fiddler and drum connected). Mild was hot and spicy. A guy at the bar recommended Hot Cajun, hmmm, maybe mild cajun, hehe.
 I'm definitely going back. A sign noted that after 5 on Thursdays it's AYCE Wings for $3.95.",5
Restaurants,Awesome Fish Sandwich Best in Pittsburgh go for the beer battered ENJOY!!!!,5
Restaurants,"Normally I try to avoid the big-box, fast food chains, but this location is a bit sentimental for me.  It has always been here (as far as I can remember) since I have been in Charlotte, so it's gone through some renovations.  I still remember going to this BK on the way home from school or when we were out running errands.

The staff is pretty friendly and very efficient.  Never really had a bad experience here.

My newest experience was with the new 20 piece nuggets they offer.  I dived right in and also made it a combo....  I got about halfway through and realized that 20 nuggets is WAAAAAAYYYY too much for just one person.  I guess that's why the guy looked at me funny when I ordered.

I HATE to waste food, so I powered through it.  And then got home and rolled around on the floor with a tummy ache for about 30min.

The nuggets themselves are pretty good.  Its if McDonald's nuggets and Wendy's nuggets had an illegitimate love child.  That's how I would describe the new nuggets at BK.",4
Restaurants,"Cashiers like to smoke right outside the entrance and open to the door while doing so to talk to their friends.  Annoying, young and unprofessional staff",1
Restaurants,"So incredibly nasty...it's 8 am Monday morning and I'm the only one here.  There are two people working and although the grade is 99, the entire place is nasty...greasy doors, food on the floor, every counter I looked at was streaked and grimy. They were sooo nice and the coffee was great, hash browns cold.  I wouldn't leave any stars if there were an option",1
Restaurants,"The customer service at this one sucks so bad, I know every one has a bad day but to have that bad day every week is pretty bad. Don't eat here if you are on the go and don't already have napkins in your car, because they are not going to offer napkins or anything else to you. When you ask for napkins they give you just one so if you have more than one order everybody has to share so good luck with that. And the attitudes are just nasty, the guys act as if the money is coming out if their checks to pay for good customer service and napkins.",2
Restaurants,staff was super rude at this location. who charges .11 for bbq sauce? definitely won't be back.,1
Restaurants,"I have been to a couple different City Tavern locatations and had the exact same experience. The food is not good at all, and is completely over priced. I've had their crab leg special and crab cakes and wasn't impressed at all. I would only return to get drinks, and because the City Tavern by where I live has great outdoor seating.",2
Restaurants,"I have been here a few tomes but only for lunch.  I have always had the chicken panzanella, and it is quite yummmy.  Also at lunch the prices are really reasonable   I think at night time this place is yup city, but they do have a wonderful outdoor patio on top of the restaurant that's cool.",4
Restaurants,"Yeah, they're closed.  Shock of the century.  Overpriced drinks and a pretentious menu that didn't live up to its vision.  For this neighborhood in general it was too ambitious.  The same restaurant downtown probably would have soared because Uptowners tend to ignore prices more.  But in Dilworth it's trying too hard.  Just be a pub!  People love pubs!",3
Restaurants,"The Tryon House is as old-school southern diner thats been around long before diners or Southern food became cool again. (The ageing interior definitely bears witness to this). While I'm partial to both, my meal at the Tryon House ""did the job"" and little else.

Like all good diners, the Tryon House has blue plate specials; the holy trinity of a meat, veggie, and a starch.  The blue plate special are around $6.50.  In my case, it was a hamburger steak covered in yellow onions and brown gravy, green beans, and yams.  While not impressive or particularly flavorful, the food sticks to your ribs. And of course, its served with a complementary chicken soup (more like chicken broth) and cornbread.  

Our waitress was quick if not hurried for no apparent reason. She literally whisked herself after every order, refill, and ""How's everything going?"".  Thats a bit unnerving, but I didn't have high expectations at a diner.  Will I go back?  Hmmm, maybe.  Like all good diners, I'm sure Tryon House has that one dish that really defines them (think Grecian Chicken at Ted's or fried squash at Crown Point).  Tryon House is certainly not a destination for me, but its cheap and near my job.   It seems like fair bet for lunch if I'm craving diner fare.",2
Restaurants,LOYAL local's lunch spot. Great service. Average food. Complimentary soup.,3
Restaurants,"Ordered a basic breakfast which came out wrong (eggs cooked rock hard).  No problem.  They corrected the order with two minutes.  (Note:  Can no one in Charlotte cook eggs properly anymore?).  That aside, I was greeted promptly and my waitress was kind and efficient without calling me babe or honey--I like that.

The Tryon House has fallen into a slumber that's all too common.  Instead of focusing on fresh, awesome dishes that patrons rave about, they go for the quick, cheap and easy.  They could still offer the basics, but there's nothing signature here.  Other than low price and quick service, why repeat the experience unless you're starving?  A gem in a transitional neighborhood just waiting, waiting, waiting.",3
Restaurants,"Very good food for the price. They offer a free soup with your meal as well. They offer a wide variety of food including Greek, of which their gyro platter is excellent. In a slightly run down area but the actual restaurant has a very pleasant, cozy atmosphere which is hard to find in the city.",5
Restaurants,"I haven't been to this Waffle House location in about a year, so as far as I know, things may have gotten better.  The reason I stopped going was that the last time that I went, the waitress was incredibly rude to me, so much so that other guests started looking over at my table probably because they were so disturbed at the treatment I was receiving as well.  The waitress wouldn't look me in the eye, spoke harshly to me, and I had to ask her multiple times to tell me what my choices for soft drinks were.  I am 90 percent sure that this was a racial issue.  I was the only white person in the establishment and I feel that this was almost an attempt to send the message that I wasn't welcome there.  Well, it worked.  I haven't gone back.  I think whoever runs this Waffle House needs to ask him or herself whether this is the kind of reputation he or she wants it to have though.",1
Restaurants,went here about 2am after working a late night call case . ignored for a while . just left . short staffing and bad attitudes!,1
Restaurants,"I pulled over into this Waffle House to get out of the rain and to let some of this weekday 5 o'clock traffic die down. The entire staff was wonderful. The two waitresses that were working that night were down to earth, friendly, and extremely funny. Even if the meal wasn't good they would have made the trip inside worth it, but I had no complaints for my Texas Bacon Patty Melt w/hash browns and added onions (I literally gained two pounds while I was writing this...I can only imagine how much I gained while I actual ate this). The cook talked to my bf about sports and the other customers even got in on the conversation and it ended up that the entire place was laughing. I felt like they were part of my extended family and will definitely be back, if not for the food then for the hospitality :)",5
Restaurants,"Went into this establishment while visiting Charlotte for the first time, and was not impressed. Upon entering there were only 2 tables being occupied but all of the other ones still had not been wiped down and were filthy. Also there were 3 prisoners or community service people in yellow vests washing the windows, splashing water all over the tables. So we had to sit at the bar. The bar was situated right next to the sink where one of the workers was vigorously washing dishes and splashing water all over the area where we were eating. This splashing did not stop when we got our coffees to drink.

The waitress was friendly but upon receiving our silverware I was horrified to see that my fork had a big glob of mustard on it. How could you b e working so hard to wash the dishes and not even notice the silverware isn't even clean?! Also my girlfriends butterknife looked to have water on it still but not clean water, dirty white soap water.

The only redeeming quality of this place was that our order was taken accurately and I didn't get food poisoning from my meal.

Would not go to again, if I'm visiting Charlotte again I will wait until I get back to Georgia to eat, this is the only nasty Waffle House I've ever been to.",1
Restaurants,"The three stars are only bc I don't think the intent of the ladies there were malicious just not professional. The food was mediocre the service was subpar. I don't have high expectations for Waffle House because well...its Waffle House, but this location was definitely not meeting even minimum expectations. No one greeted me, it took awhile before someone would take my order and again the food wasn't good. I'll stick to my regular Independence location from now on.",3
Restaurants,"Hit up this Waffle House location after a night out with some friends. The place was pretty packed and we had to wait for a table (about 10 minutes or so). However, the service is FAST so tables will clear out pretty quickly. The staff here, as at most Waffle Houses are characters. Lots of yelling back and forth. Not always the friendliest, but they get the job done. 

Is Waffle House a culinary experience? Not by any means. Is it the best food in the world at 3am? ABSOLUTELY.",3
Restaurants,This is the absolute worst Waffle House ever!!! The service is slow the food is cold & the staff is rude!!! I'm never going back. The District Manager has even attempted to call me & offer me a gift card or a free meal & I have turned him down... This place is horrible!!!,1
Restaurants,"I am kinda a Waffle House connoisseur when I travel to N Carolina I really wish I could get one near me in California. Best breakfast going at super reasonable prices. Always friendly and clean, my favorite is 2 pork chops and eggs with hash browns and toast, today I saw a waitress having the same with grilled onions on top. I just had to have, and they did not disappoint. Forever a fan of Waffle House",5
Restaurants,"Left coyote joes , came here , great service.  Fast service and friendly folks.  Our waitress was Dee! She did an amazing job. The whole restaurant was singing country a country song, staff was record out ! To funny. They are blessed with patience because most of us were drunk.",5
Restaurants,"So, just for some context, my family and I have a Waffle House tradition.  We are from New England, which is entirely void of these places.  So, when we travel, if there is a Waffle House in the area, we always go.  When comparing these places I bench mark them to 2 of them that I have been to against all others.  These 2 were in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and had the friendliest most respectful staff.  The food across all of them is pretty consistent, with mediocre waffles and great hash browns cooked with the additions that you want.

This place was just plain depressing.  I walk in and sit down.  Nobody says a word for me for about 10 minutes, although it was not crowded at all.  Finally my waitress, without even looking at me, say, ""Here or takeout?"".  This began a meal where most of the staff never made eye contact, never smiled, never asked how me or my meal was.  I thought I was in an episode of the Twilight Zone.  Finally, there was a waitress who was smiling and friendly.  As it turned out, she was in from another store.

Many Waffle Houses see it as part of there ""thing"" to be friendly.  Many even have a practice where whenever some enters the whole staff say good morning in unison.  this one, not so much.  I have to say, that when you have an individual like this it is an individual staff issue.  When you have an entire store like this, then it is certainly the management.  

For my part, I will just chalk this up as another part of the quaintness of my ongoing Waffle House tradition.  But if Waffle House corporate reads these, this is probably something that is easily correctable.",2
Restaurants,"We decided to eat at the Waffle House because the diner we really wanted to go to had too long of a wait time. We walked in and we were surprised that they had seating available right away. We sat down and immediately felt uncomfortable because the a/c was on full blast. The  waitress came over right away and we ordered coffee. As we waited for the coffee, we got colder by the minute. She brought the coffee over and the minute she sat it down I realized that it wouldn't be long before my HOT coffee would turn into ICED coffee. The blast from the a/c was literally blowing all the steam right out of the coffee cup. We were wearing thick sweaters but we were still freezing. I started to realize that our food would get the same cooling effect as the coffee so we decided to leave.  Who wants to start out eating a hot meal to only have it turn ice cold before you have a chance to finish? We told the waitress that we didn't want to order anything else and wanted the bill. We told her that we were too cold to stay. She waived the bill and apologized and we left. The waitress was warm and friendly but the Waffle House was icy cold.",1
Restaurants,"Extremely busy on a Sunday morning, I got in and managed to snag the last seat at the counter. But then, the counter was grubby, my waitress didn't bring me a menu or take my order for a bit, and didn't bring back my coffee. Yes, it was very busy.

Food arrived a little haphazard. Waffle first, then a few minutes later, my eggs and hash browns. And then my plate of city ham. And then somehow, a second plate of city ham. Weirdly timed, but it was very busy.

All of it was cooked properly. And the payment taking was easy enough.

Set a low expectation and you'll be pleased with the outcome.",3
Restaurants,"Finally hit up Waffle house.  You get a crap ton of food for a low price.  It was mediocre, but it is waffle house.  What did I expect? The positive was it was cheap, the staff was singing and having a good time, and there were a lot of regulars interacting with the workers.  The con is that it is waffle house.",3
Restaurants,Really bad service. I ordered a chocolate chip waffle and when it came it was a plain waffle with a lot of chocolate chips on top. When I asked the waitress because other waffle houses have the chips inside the batter she said they no longer do it that way here. Grabbed my waffle and threw it away. She then had someone make it with the chips inside the matter. Once the waffle came she said to me I did this for you but doesn't mean someone else will. They had attitudes and did not seem happy that I said anything.,1
Restaurants,"Tacos.  They are so delicious yet so bad for you.  But at .99 per 2, you can't go wrong after a long night of beer.

On a side note, their Asian Grilled chicken salad is good too.",3
Restaurants,"Honestly the food is great, although their single burger prices makes one have to buy a meal ($5 for a burger).... I enjoyed the food better than Mickey D's- I wish there was one in the Chicagoland area",4
Restaurants,"Quick service, pretty clean, staff was nice.  Not crowded at all @ 6:30p on a Monday.  Better looking than other Jack locations we've been to in the CLT & was easily accessible via wheelchair for my hubby!  We tried the Bourbon BBQ Steak sandwiches -- pretty good, pretty greasy too!


Update:  right after I wrote the review last night, more traffic started coming in.  We quickly became the minority by a landslide, and not able to understand anything anyone else was saying.  I thought we time-warped somehow to South of the US border, but we were still in Charlotte.  The cashier at the counter became completely TOO LOUD, carrying on loud, Spanish conversations with some of the patrons.  Most likely better enjoyed via the drive-thru or with earbuds/music.",4
Restaurants,"I just don't think the food is that good, I have eaten there 3 or 4 times, nothing special. I'd rate them Behind Wendy's, McD's, BK, Sonic, Hardees, and the local fast food places. I've been to Seattle, it seemed better out there, maybe because they have more customers and the food is fresher. The closed stores dotting the area should give you a clue.",2
Restaurants,"the food is fantastic but the customer service leaves alot to be desired. tonight I witness 3 orders in a row including myself turn back around to get the order corrected. Not because we got each-others orders,but because the orders where just wrong.",2
Restaurants,"I haven't known Jack in a while. I don't eat his food all that often, preferring Dave Thomas most of the time. So when I stopped in here for the first time in over a decade, I was surprised to see how many different things that they have on their menu - chicken, tacos, burgers, all sorts of stuff. And so I ended up choosing the ""Bonus Jack"" which is a whole lot like the Big Mac except the sesame seeds on the bun. With a small side of curly fries (they don't have those at McDonald's!), I decided to sit inside and people watch for a bit.

So how was it? Looking little like the picture on the menu board, but still a decent fast food sandwich. The cheese wasn't melted. The fries weren't hot. The soda fountain area was untidy. One of the napkin dispensers was empty. But the staff was nice enough when she brought my tray to my table. So that saves Jack from a one star.

About ten minutes after I'd gotten my food, there was another shout for a Bonus Jack and curly fries. Yep, they'd made my order twice. Dumb.",2
Restaurants,Had to get a breakfast jack for old time sake.  They don't have these in NY anymore...too bad!,4
Restaurants,"I love, love, love, LOVE Jack In The Box!! Sourdough Jack's are the best sandwich on the menu. Employees are always polite, no matter which franchise I go to.",5
Restaurants,"I am from New York, and can only get this when travel to Charlotte.  Came to this location for the first time a couple of years ago and fell in love with sliders lol.  They season the freaking meat!!!  Added onions that were cooked and nothing like the wet weirdness that is White Castles.  We actually ordered and packed these little suckers to take back to NY.  Yes, gross but they are that good.  I think I like this fast food place because it tastes nothing like anything I am used to and everything does not taste the same---I am looking at you Mc D, Wendy and the King.  The variety is cool.  

Last night arriving at our destination after road tripping we went straight to our dream spot and were disappointed sliders slid off the menu.  We were not left disappointed for long as we had a huge variety to choose from.  My daughter ordered breakfast at 11pm.  How awesome was that?!?! Steak fries with chili and jalapeño for moi.  Yes gross and I will have heartburn in a day and giant monstrous thighs in a week, but I loved every minute.",5
Restaurants,Real good & real good service strawberry shakes rock great after late nite at race track and staying across the street darn good.,5
Restaurants,"Very disappointed!! My very first visit to a Jack in the box and NO ONE even greeted us, not even the employee who was leaving! There was no one up front to take orders. We left and went to Sonics next door for our dinner!!",1
Restaurants,"So TOTALLY didn't realize these existed on this side of the country! Stumbled across Jack in the Box while looking for a Starbucks and had to at least try it once!....It was....Meh. 

The menu was surprisingly big for a fast food place, featuring everything from breakfast items to burgers to tacos to...Chinese food? Yeah...The menu here is a bit random. Perhaps that's the draw? 

We decided to keep it simple and try a burger and fries. The burger was of the  unimpressive fast food variety but the curly fries were pretty good! Sorta like Arby's. 

Service was very slow, and kinda lackadaisical. No one greeted us and we waited about five minutes to order despite there being no line. For a few moments there was no one behind the counter at all. 

I probably won't be back any time soon, especially not this location.",2
Restaurants,Food was ok. Ordered to go. When I got home I saw that the order was wrong and food was missing. I guess you get what you pay for.,1
Restaurants,If it were possible to choose 0 stars I Would do so. The person who took our order was rude and cut us off at the speaker and did not allow us to complete our order before speaking. Once pulling to the window the food was shoved through the window at us and the orders were wrong. We pulled back around and the manager rushed us and told us to pull to the front barely listening to our issue. Extremely disappointed with this visit.,1
Restaurants,"Ok so this review is based on my experience here. We walked in and got in line behind two people. For 15 minutes we waited and not one of them served. Then one person got his food and to my surprise the order was wrong. It was two chicken strip meals with fries and he got one chicken strip meal with 3 tacos. How does a man not remember an order that simple? Is it because he is lazy, or stupid, or unmotivated? I think it is all of those because that halfwit must have done the worst job behind the counter  that I have ever seen. In the end we did not get our food because a very hairy and sweaty man with a John Deer tattoo on his neck went behind the counter which really disgusted me.",1
Restaurants,"Wow... I love jack in the box, but my mom and I went through the drive through this morning and we had a pretty short and simple order... When we drove up to the window, no one was there. And not only that, but there was a girl towards the back who was on her phone. She didn't tell us our total, just took our card and didn't even give us our receipt. Again, its a relatively simple order and yet they took a solid fifteen minutes to complete it. They had us pull up around the corner to give us our order. The same girl came up WITH her phone in hand not to mention there weren't even napkins in the bag. It did not look good for the place. This is not the first time we've had such bad service here. If it weren't my love for the tacos and the convenience of the location I wouldn't come back. Please, Jack In The Box, work on your customer service and your workers' phones being out. Much thanks from a loyal customer.",2
Restaurants,"I don't know why I ever try Jack in the Box - they have always let me down. I was in a hurry - the person at the drive through was too apparently - she gave me my food fast and left - no receipt. I waited so I could ask her for it for a good couple minutes...beeped horn... beep again... I go inside the store, now upset to get receipt. Manager greets me - can see I'm upset - I tell him what's up - he says he heard me beeping. Yet he didn't nothing - what a manager. Anyway the service at this location is so awful, I won't be back and don't recommend this location - theirs a Wendy's across the street FYI.",1
Restaurants,"I get it, people get annoyed when someone says "" I'm from NY so I know good wings, pizza, subs, italian food, bagels etc"" and why doesn't Charlotte have these things? 

but generally I dismiss that because I have found all good versions of the above at some location. Nothing is ever the same as where you grow up- whether you're from NY or from Albuquerque (or insert random hometown)

But that being said Substation II really reminded me of everything a meatball sub should NOT be...

My remembrance of a meatball sub:

Served on a toasted hot garlicky Italian sub roll topped with oooey gooey mozzarella, three large homemade meatballs, and sauce that would put your Italian grandmother to shame.

What I got - Salty McSalterson's sauce and 10 mini meatballs that easily came from the frozen foods section. If that was what I wanted I would head over to HT and pick some up myself. Sadly this sub had little cheese to offer but luckily the bread was at least fresh. Do yourself a favor and for 50 cents extra head to subway and get their foot-long because essentially they are on the same caliber ...actually if I am honest, subways rivaled theirs. 

They also have ""scrap"" sandwich on their menu ...I am not sure how this is suppose to sound appealing.

This will probably be my one and only visit here considering we have about 7 subshops within 2 minutes of my office. Yay Jersey Mikes !",2
Restaurants,"I have been to a Sub Station II before, but not this one.  I was 5th in line but still ordering within 5 min.  I go the special of the day... #3 ham salami and cheese.  I am a fan of knowing they slice the meat and cheese as they make the sandwich.  I am not a fan of not seeing the other ingrediants and watching them make the sandwich.  I guess Subway and Quiznos has spoiled me a bit.  The sandwich was ready in just a couple of minutes and was very good so the ingrediants must have been fresh.  The small sandwich special with chips and a drink was $7.12 so that was a good thing too.  I will definitely go back.",4
Restaurants,I drive past a lot of sandwich shops on my way to Cindy's Sub Station II on Arrowood Road.  The meats and cheeses are sliced fresh in front of you and somehow the sandwiches I get from this location seem to taste better than ones I've gotten from other Sub Station locations.  The store is always clean and the help is always efficient and friendly.  I will definitely be back.,5
Restaurants,"Well, for years I've heard term "" if you want to eat some good food eat where truckers eat"". Not far from me is a such place have noticed for years that they get a lot of traffic in this restaurant,: so I decided to give it a try. They have a modest down home decor put a warm friendly atmosphere. Hey I understand why the truckers and many others stop in here daily too, food is down home good.",4
Restaurants,"My coworkers introduced me to this place for lunch a long time ago. It's tucked into a shopping center behind the new Steele Creek Police Department  and I wouldn't have known it was there. It's a simple no frills restaurant with excellent home style American cuisine. I don't bother with McDonald's or Burger King anymore, I am spoiled by the burgers here and I love the flounder plate as well, and if you want a good breakfast it's also a great place for that. There always seems to be something good on the specials menu, and the staff is very friendly It's a no frills look, but the place is clean, the staff is friendly and the food is fantastic. I love this restaurant. 

My only complaint is that they aren't open on Sunday.",5
Restaurants,"This place was recommended to my husband we gave it a try on Monday. They seems to have numerous daily specials as well as your everyday grill/burger/deli selections. Price is certainly reasonable especially compared to portion size. It's a decent sized place and was busy-busy around 1PM. Service was great I can think of a few places that could take a page from their customer service book, for sure!!! Being our first visit we---as in I the picky one of us was a tad overwhelmed with the choices. That always makes me feel a lil rushed especially at peak times, zero need to worry, the lady who took our order couldn't have been any nicer. This is certainly a place to try!!",5
Restaurants,Don't even....NO!  Words cannot really describe the lunch buffet.  The parking lot is empty for reason...enough said!,1
Restaurants,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food is amazing, take out or buffet. The waitress is very nice, and she knows my preferences. Try the seam chicken and lo mein, they're cooked just how I like it. The price is affordable, and your getting your money's worth. The restaurant is a little hard to find, it's a tiny little place. The parking lot is empty because there are mostly call-in orders.",5
Restaurants,Nice little restaurant. Nothing fancy or incredible but consistently good food and friendly service. Also generous portions  Don't let the outside of the building fool you. The pork dumplings and chickens steamers are good.,3
Restaurants,"I have no idea why we've never been there before, but we tried them out for dinner on a whim last night, and really enjoyed the food!  The veggies were fresh and crunchy, the shrimp and scallops in our Happy Family were perfectly cooked, and the crab rangoon and plum sauce tasted homemade.  The prices are great, too!  Now we know that we have good Chinese within walking distance of our house, we'll be back often.",4
Restaurants,"Buffet isn't that great, but the take out is awesome.  I highly recommended for take out.",4
Restaurants,"This place needs some cleaning!!!!!! We tried it because of the great reviews , the buffet was gross, the hibachi chicken was not bad, but just eating it in that dirty place wasn't pleasant.",2
Restaurants,This place is a rundown shack. The buffet had no food. 3 pieces of fries. 2 broccolis. It was pretty much empty. We left because it was a joke. Just awful ..,1
Restaurants,Tired of chain restaurants? This husband-wife owned hole-in-the-wall serves up great spice and tasty Asian food for dinner. My husband and I shared a hibachi plate and an authentic Chinese chicken dish. We can't wait to bring more people here.,5
Restaurants,"I will give this place a 5 star for two reasons. #1 is the outstanding service that we get every time we visit Ocean Palace. Athena and her family are very friendly and have always gave us the best service. Yes, there is a limited choice on the buffet however, if you let them know which option on the buffet you prefer, they will always make it fresh for you. We've been there during their slow time and as soon as we walk in, since we are what you at call regulars, always make our favorites fresh for us. 
#2 is the quality of the hibachi menu and their carry out. Their hibachi menu, if at a ""more visually appealing"" location, could easily charge twice their menu price.",5
Restaurants,"The food is AWESOME. Everything we've ever ordered from here is fantastic. It's not the place to go for ambiance, but It's family owned, which we love, and the service is quick and the staff is so hospitable! The portions are large too. This is where we always get take out when we want Asian food in this area.  Hibachi or Chinese style, I would recommend this place over and over.",4
Restaurants,"Food was so greasy and oily... Please check before you eat here, worst Buffet I ever had, you are going to puke for sure After you eat here...that's what it happened to me",1
Restaurants,"I only had the lunch buffet and I am sure 3 pm is not the best (freshest) time to go. The price was legit for what I had. Service was great, food, well it was your typical buffet nothing special stood out but several items were quite tasty.",3
Restaurants,"I've passed this place several times to and from work and the outside appearance has always made me doubtful.  After thoroughly reading the reviews I finally decided to give it a try.  I ordered the Hibachi shrimp and steak with extra shrimp and the steamed pork dumplings to go.  I finally get home and tried the food and it was delicious!  It was quick, friendly and the food was hot.  They now have a new customer.  I will surely return to order again!",4
Restaurants,"Not the best place to dine-in, but the take out is the best in town! Try to look past the Scenery and its a great place!",5
Restaurants,"The lunch buffet was greasy and unappetizing. At least it was cheap!
The dining room and restaurant are run down and shabby.
Maybe it's better for dinner?",2
Restaurants,"Great food, good prices. I don't go anywhere else for my hibachi. They have generous portions and don't water down their shrimp sauce like other places. This place is definitely a hidden gem within Fort Mill. Highly recommended but I believe owner says they're closing for good on June 29th. Will miss the good food and family that runs this place.",5
Restaurants,"I am going to update this review based on my visit today.  Had a coupon for $1 double cheeseburger which was good.  Place is pretty clean, and the employees working wash their hands often.  The woman working the register today knew what she was doing  too, so it wasn't as slow as usual.

Food is okay for a ""fast"" food joint.  ""Fast"" is in quotes because this is one of the slowest places you will ever eat at - fast food or not.  The people seem to be nice enough, but they don't have a clue as to what they are doing.  Every time I go here it takes about 10 minutes to get my food, even on a Monday evening with hardly any other people in there.  The only reason I go back is the burgers are halfway decent (although not as good as advertised) and they send out a plethora of coupons making meals very cheap.  The hand breaded chicken tenders are okay, but there is too much bread, not enough chicken, and the bread is rubbery.",4
Restaurants,"I never have been a big Hardee's fan but let me say, their food has improved tremendously and this location is very clean (compared to about 5-7 years ago). Workers very friendly!!!",3
Restaurants,Slowest fast food place i have ever been to.  If there were any choices across the street this place would no longer be open.,2
Restaurants,"I'm only giving this 2 stars because its a Hardee's and they actually do a good job with their breakfast food.  The reason why they aren't getting 5 stars is because of the service.  I've been to this location a handful of times since it opened and it has always been slow.  Last weekend I waited in the drive thru for 15-20 minutes, that's not what I call Fast Food.

Saturday morning we stopped by to pick some food up before a day trip to the zoo.  I went in to order our food, by the time I walked in the door and got our food, 25 minutes had passed.  The only reason I didn't leave was because I promised my 3 year old a sausage biscuit from Hardee's.  While in the restaurant, another customer made a comment about something to the manager, the customer pulled the manager to the side so everyone else around could not hear, but as he turned to walk away he said, ""Whatever"", at that point the manager turned to walk back to the kitchen and said loud enough for everyone in line to hear her say ""yeah, whatever"".  I understand manager's get frustrated, but this manager was extremely rude.

This restaurant lost 10-15 customers in the time I was there due to slow service.

If you want fast food and polite service, go somewhere else.",2
Restaurants,"I wish it were possible to give ZERO stars, but it's not, so one star is it.

I'm not expecting much whenever I do fast food, but not much was exactly what I got at this Hardee's. My little nephew begged me to take him there for a hot dog, so like the doting Aunt I am, off we went to Hardee's.  I think it was the evening of October 2.

The place was filthy--sticky floors and unwashed tables.  Yuck.  There was one person ahead of us, who stood there forever before he was waited on.  I watched as a zombie-like clerk expended all of his energy in taking this man's order.  It was hard to watch.

Then it was our turn.  The zombie looked at us, turned on his heel and disappeared for a ridiculous amount of time.  I'm pretty sure we stood there five full minutes before a female zombie showed up.  With no attempt of a smile, and dull, glassy eyes, she asked, 'what do you want?'  Wow.  We placed our order, making sure she understood that we wanted a plain hotdog--nothing on it at all--with fries and a coke.  With all the effort she could muster, she collected our payment and turned and walked away.  No smile, no ""thank you,"" no ""that will be just a minute.""  Nothing.

After about fifteen minutes, we went up to the counter to see what the delay was (considering we were only one of two customers in the building).  We showed the zombie our receipt, who took a very long time to read the receipt, before turning away and disappearing in the back.  Again, without a word.

Ten minutes later, she appeared with out hot dog.  Covered in mustard.  We reminded her that we asked for a plain hot dog, specifically stating we wanted nothing on it.  She mumbled, ""that's how our plain dogs are--with mustard.""  She just didn't get it.  Rather than making the poor thing expend another ounce of energy, we asked her to remake the order with nothing on the dog, and to please not just wipe off the ketchup--make a new dog.  And also, where are the fries?  She rolled her eyes at that one.  I guess we were asking far too much of her.  Poor thing.

The new dog came back.  I use the term ""new"" loosely, as this poor dog was basically the consistency of vulcanized rubber.  And cold.  At this point, we'd been here about 45 minutes, and I was in no mood to deal with the incompetent zombies again.  My nephew stoically nibbled on the dog before asking if he could just eat his fries, to which I agreed, of course.

My nephew summed it up when he said, ""Aunt T, Hardee's was my favorite place before.  Is it ok if we never come back here again?""  Of course, little man.  Never again.",1
Restaurants,"Worst drive-thru I've ever been to, mostly because in the three times I gave this sorry excuse for a restaurant a chance, twice it screwed up!  The first time they didn't give me half my food and I had to go back for the rest.  The second time we pulled up to the drive-thru with three hours to spare and sat there for three minutes waiting for someone to come to the speaker.  When they didn't, I tried to go in to order food.  THE DOORS WERE LOCKED!  Yet when someone else approached the window they instantly took their order!  Complained to corporate, which trickled down to regional, which got passed to the restaurant itself.  Their response?  Basically ""Oh well.  We don't give a crap.""  I give you two tries then that's it.  Don't bother with this place.  Seriously.",1
Restaurants,"So I don't frequent fast food restaurants often, and it's usually because of the experience I just had.

A friend and I went through the drive through (it was just before 9:00pm). I tried to order chicken tenders and was told that they don't have anymore for this time of night. I know in fast food terms, that just means the employees have gotten lazy and stopped making them. Not even an apology. I was stuck ordering something I didn't even really want.

I ordered the nachos. Although there was a car in front of us, I do feel like waiting 15 minutes for our order was just far too long for a ""fast food"" restaurant. It's clear to me that this particular Hardees is just mismanaged and should probably be evaluated.

Also - just as a side note as to the attitude of the employees - lights were flickering on and off and so when I looked inside, one of the employees gave me a very discomforting look.",2
Restaurants,"NEVER ENOUGH STAFF. I have emailed and complained several times and nothing is ever done. unless you come at like 3pm, there will always be like a 10 min wait, NO LIE. There are only 3 people ever working. One at the drive through, One at the walk in register and one cooking. Sometimes there will be a manager walking around but she/he is never doing anything. Wait times are ridiculous and they are more focused on the drive through than the walk in customers. I have written reviews on Hardee's website complaining and completed them in the time that it takes to get my food. Food is fine, just don't consider it fast food.",1
Restaurants,A SNAILS PACE. Their still slower than ever. The move at a snails pace. I've watch grass grow faster than they make the food here. It's in no was fast food.,1
Restaurants,"The food is good - both breakfast and lunch, however every time we have eaten there, it is a little slow.  One time we were there for 30 minutes after we finished eating - waiting for the bill.  Seems to happen quite often.",3
Restaurants,We stopped over the weekend for lunch. Both had a sandwich and some chilli. The food was acceptable. As with other posts service was a little slow. We sat at the bar and noticed how dirty it was behind the bar. Ice machine vent was full of dust and the floor was disgusting with dirt that has been there for a long time. The place needs a good cleaning.,1
Restaurants,The food was very tasty bar food. Our service was also very good.  The prices were reasonable. We will definitely go back.,4
Restaurants,"Oh Black Bear Inn... You have so much potential! 

It's been almost a week since I devoured your sweet potato fries and I'm still thinking about them! SO GOOD! I'll go as far to say they were the best I've ever had! Super crunchy on the outside, sweet, and soft on the inside. My chicken sandwitch was also delectible. The chicken tasted like it was cooked on a char-coal grill, pounded thin, juicy, tender, and slathered with pepper-jack cheese. Yum Yum! You are right on par with food!

The downsides...Service was friendly but slow. It was Taco Tuesday but your specials were hard to understand and unfortunately, our very kind server had pretty broken english. We wished there would have been something on the tables to reference in writing what they were. We would have loved to try those tacos! Also, your place is ditry! A thick coat of dust covered every surface in the dining room. While that's not the end of the world, it makes me wonder how the back of the house looks if that's how the front of the house is.  Also, our beer tasted a little funky, clean your tappers please! 

I really want to make this a regular go to spot, ooohhh those fries, but it needs a really good cleaning. You have potential to steal the scene in Cottage Grove! Your food is delicious enough for people to make a special trip but you need to clean and organize your front of the house a little better. This is one foodies plea to you. I want to spend my money there!",3
Restaurants,"Visited the Inn for lunch with a friend a couple of weeks ago now. We ordered their sweet potato fries, and I had a chicken wrap, both of which were delish. Decent prices too (around $5 for the fries, around $7 for the wrap). Friendly service as well. 

SO why only 3 stars? Well, unfortunately, I ordered a Fat Tire, and it definitely tasted off...so their taps need to be cleaned. Another downgrade is the decor, which could use some updating. Also, their specials were not super-clearly explained, and could be placed more prominently somewhere in the restaurant (like those table tents or something?).",3
Restaurants,"We went on a Saturday night. It was OK.  I hate giving bad reviews but this place was definitely not destination worthy.  

My GF had the prime rib which was tender but bland.  I had the crab legs. They were pretty small. The ""juice wasn't worth the squeeze"" on a couple of the legs.  Both entrees came with a salad bar which had maybe 10 ingredients to choose from. Not impressive.  To top it off there was a fan running full blast right above our table. When we asked the waitress to turn it down she told us that the manager was the only person who knew how to turn it down and he was on vacation.  So our food got cold really quickly.

 If you are in Cottage Grove and want a bar burger I'm sure this place will suffice but not much beyond that.",2
Restaurants,The prime rib breakfast special is great. It is only served Sunday till it runs out though.I prefer my hash browns crunchy and they were perfect today.,3
Restaurants,Best burgers in Madison! I have never had a bad dining experience here. Everyone is friendly and the service is very good.,5
Restaurants,"Good place to go for your standard American cuisine. Don't expect to be amazed but do expect good food, good bar food, that is.",4
Restaurants,"Far east side Madison resident so quick and easy to get to the Black Bear.  The casual and friendly feel of the place suits me well because I usually stop in for a quick dinner by myself.  I like that I can get a good piece of fish that is not FRIED.  Nothing I have had to eat there is really special but all has been good.  Would like to see a couple better craft beers on tap but they have some good bottled ones as an option.  TIP:  Nice fireplace if you sit in the dining room but don't sit too close to, it gets a bit smoky at times!",4
Restaurants,"Delicious fish fry/baked on Friday night.  
Waitress took our drink order but didn't return from the bar until about fifteen minutes later with our drinks.
Salad bar came with out meal but was completely bare...looked like a crowd just went through but they weren't that busy.  No cheese, no cottage cheese, no ""cukes"", a few pieces of lettuce...that was sad.
Every table had complimentary dinner rolls or bread in a basket except us; again our waitress never came back until she brought out bill.  another employee brought out our fish. We finally asked another waiter if bread/rolls came with our fish and he brought us some.  It was worth asking for; nice and warm with butter...mmmmm
All things considered, the meal was good and If your lucky enough to be in good company or with someone you love,  you barely notice the inconveniences. 
Will definitely come back though, because it was reasonably priced, good baked and fried fish and I believe maybe just an off night for staff there. 
A quaint little joint away from the college scene that is my neighborhood.  Sometimes just a little break .",4

It's a little bit more off campus than Mickie's so you won't have to deal with large crowds.  I went there for breakfast the day of Mifflin one year and was seated immediately.  If you like breakfast food I recommend you give it a try.",4

Restaurants,"Why do I love diners the most out of all food establishments? Perhaps because of my father, who loves diners? I cannot say. There's just something about simple food and a cast of characters that makes for a good time.

The two brothers that own this little mainstay of Madison are amusing. They're both quite friendly and make you feel at home. One cooks all the food by himself. The other orders, washes dishes, makes the coffee and rings you up. On a Saturday morning, it's like watching a low-budget Cirque du Soleil. Food is always spot on and the decor is everything a diner should be complete with counter seating. Many a morning did I spend at this little spot, driving my cholesterol through the roof. What a time... What a way to go...",5
Restaurants,"Tried Atlanta Bread Company for the first (and last) time this week.  Food was very mediocre.  Fillings of sandwiches were fine, but the bread tasted stale.  To be named ""Atlanta BREAD Company"" and not have bread that knocks your socks off is ridiculous.  Not to mention the unfriendly manager and a front door that wouldn't open properly.  Overall, not a good experience.",1
Restaurants,"I sort of agree with last reviewer But I didn't have any rude manager to deal with.  Not much  of a selection for a place that has bread in their name.  It reminded me of Panera Bread, but with less selection.  I went for breakfast.  The Coffee that was in the HOT pots was cold.

Public Services & Government,Yeah there are lots of weird folks trying to get money from the government and yes they like to shout at the poor workers in the windows but MAKE AN APPOINTMENT PEOPLE!!  It's not that hard.  If you have an appointment they come and take you away from all the drones sitting there waiting to a nice office in the back where you can have a quiet discussion.  My appointments have all happened as scheduled.  You get weird looks from the folks that have been waiting for an hour before you even walked in the door.,4
Restaurants,"Had dinner there New Year's Eve and was really disappointed.  We've eaten there before and have been pleased.  But on 12/31/05 something was off, way off.  My dinner (Chicken Oscar) came out cold and I found a couple of crab shells.  My partner's dinner (Steak) came out way under-done (Medium Well was requested and we got Rare).  We sent it back to the kitchen and got fresh meals which were done properly  but okay at best.  Service was painfully slow and inattentive and they really didn't seem THAT busy.  We let them know how disappointed we were (verbally that night and in writing thru one of their comment cards) and other than 1 free dessert following dinner, had no response.  We'll have to think twice before going there for dinner again.  It's such a lovely place though and we had a nice time in the bar prior to dinner, so I'll give them an extra star for those efforts.",2
Restaurants,"There's an old adage: never order chicken at a steak house.  

A great space (high ceilings, cute little alcoves with leather sofas) undone by lack luster service and mediocre meals.  Also, somebody will have to explain hosting a large restaurant to me sometime.  Call me naive but when there's a 45 minute for a table yet the dining room seems empty, it looks like somebody screwed up.",2
Restaurants,I went to Fitch's for lunch last week and was very disappointed.  The reastaurant was empty at 12:15 and no one seated us or came out to the door for close to five minutes.  We wondered if it was closed but did see a few people eating.  It was dark - can't read the menu dark and freezing cold.  My salad was so drenched in dressing that I really couldn't eat it (my fault I didn't ask for dressing on the side?).  I give them two stars because fortunately it is no smoking and the waiter was ok.,2
Restaurants,"Holy inconsistencies, Batman. I had tried Chang Jiang a couple years ago, and was not at all pleased. A couple weeks ago, my brother convinced me to order from CJ. I tried the sesame chicken, and it was delicious. The downside: it took almost two hours to arrive. They had forgotten our order, and only realized it after we called them back after 90 minutes. Apparently their other location was closed for the night, so they were handling all orders out of one restaurant. Unfortunate, but since it was so tasty and a weird circumstance, I overlooked it.

Tonight, Christmas Eve, I decided to give them another go. They have a $15 minimum delivery, so I ordered two entrees figuring it'd make me plenty of tasty meals over the holiday weekend when nothing else is open. I ordered the sesame chicken again, and an order of lemon chicken. The food arrived in 30 minutes, but unfortunately it was...

Barf city. 

While the sesame chicken last time consisted of tasty chunks of white meat that kept their crispy coating despite soaking in sauce, this time it was especially fatty dark meat that was hard to cut and had a very displeasing mouth feel. I had expected the lemon chicken to be similar to the sesame chicken or sweet and sour chicken - battered chunks with a gooey sauce. Instead it was a chicken breast pounded flat and breaded with crumbs. The sauce was served on the side, and that's a good thing: it was so lemony and watery it seemed fake. It felt more like I was adding a dose of Lysol to my meal than a burst of citrus goodness. The chicken itself was okay, but really was no better than a cheap patty and not at all what I think of when considering Chinese takeout. 

If I knew I'd be getting the same delicious batch of food I got a couple weeks ago, I'd go back to Chang Jiang for sure. However, tonight's failure ($22 with tax and tip down the drain - hopefully I can get someone to eat the leftovers so it's not a total waste) will probably prevent me from ordering there again.",2
Restaurants,Good but not as good as the Raymond Road location.,3
Restaurants,"We eat here every once and a great while and while the food is edible, I've had better.

But what prompted me to write a review is my experience last night.  I recently went vegan and ordered the bean curd szechuan style.  What I got wasn't bean curd (or regular tofu) but silken tofu instead (which is great for blending in smoothies or as an egg replacement in baked goods, but kind of tastes like snot on its own).  Eww.  It came with peas and carrots (most likely a frozen mix since the carrots were so consistent) and a ton of sauce.  Not to mention we waited close to 90 minutes for delivery at 7pm on a Sunday.",1
Restaurants,"Call in your order ahead of time if you don't want to wait. For take-out, they certainly take their sweet time. 

I had no issues with the kung pao chicken I ordered. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness of the vegetable ingredients (green bell peppers and celery), and I liked that the chicken was finely diced. I didn't mind the overload of peanuts either. 

They are a little pricey for a mediocre take-out restaurant. For the quantity and quality of the food, I was appalled to find that an order of kung pao and general tso's came out to be $16.  Plus, the food is about as Americanized as you can get. Thus the 3 stars.",3
Restaurants,"Nothing to go out of your way to get, but not bad if you're in a pinch. On my last visit I ordered the Hunan chicken, rated spicy but won't make you break a sweat. The veggies were colorful and seemed fresh. The chicken was white meat, not chewy and cooked just right. The sauce was salty like you'd expect at a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place, but not congealed. The fried rice was fine -- I've had much greasier -- but the egg rolls leave something to be desired. They seemed a little dry and lacked flavor. I was the only person in the restaurant and waited 5 minutes for them to finish my order while a couple other people came in to pick up their takeout. Decent place to grab some Chinese takeout when you're unprepared for dinner and sick of burgers or pizza, with service much faster than the location closer to home in Verona.",3
Restaurants,"The staples are good (general Tso's, crab Rangoon).  Good for a once-a-month treat.  It's close to home so I go here.  Never had a bad experience.  Pickup orders are ready in 10 minutes, can't beat that.",3
Restaurants,"Ordered 2 items for my husband and myself over the phone. They didn't take his name or phone number etc. When he arrived 15 mins later the food wasn't ready, our order was no where to be found (shocker). 

The food was ok I guess. 
We've decided to find another place to go instead.",2
Restaurants,"As far as your Americanized Chinese food goes (by that I mean the neon colored fried meat and rice coated in sweet sauce), this hits the spot. At lunch the specials are incredibly cheap and contain very generous portions for what they charge. Meats are pretty good-- they don't contain any giant gristle pieces or raw bits, instead they seem to use pretty good quality meat and the sauces are very tasty. Not quite authentic, but for Chinese takeout food, this may be my favorite in Madison.",3
Restaurants,"The veggie fried rice is tasty but the orange chicken wasn't nice and chewy. It was hard and crusty. We ate in and my mom asked for a plate, the lady behind the counter have her a styrofoam plate instead of a nice glass one. All the silverware were plastic and it wasn't nice at all to eat it. We ordered over the phone and that lady couldn't understand our order even just the simple name she struggled with. It was exhausting. when we finally got our order in she didn't even ask for our name or number. I would only go back for the fried rice. Overall not a nice place.",2
Restaurants,"The food is so bad. I tried 2 times with 2 different dishes, and couldn't finish either time :(",1
Restaurants,"If I could give this ZERO stars I would....

he rushed me and was VERY rude. I had questions on what ingredients were in some of their items since it was my first time ordering from them and different chinese restaurants make the same dishes different ways. He was EXTREMELY rude and I asked if I could talk to someone else and he said ""there is no one else okay sorry what you want"" I said ""iv been trying to order for the last 15 mins. you know what nevermind ill go to the one on gammon"" he then hung up on me...",1
Restaurants,"Overall a decent chinese restaurant. Service is quick and always ready in 10-15 minutes. One caveat to all of this is: AVOID THE SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE. It is a total let down. As an alternative may I suggest the Hunan chicken (not as spicy as you'd think), the General Tso's (also not as spicy, but spicy enough for me), or the Crab Rangoon (don't even think about reheating them - they must be consumed in one sitting). 

One more thing to avoid - the low mein. It's a bit flavorless and limp. I keep trying it, hoping I just got a bad batch, but no such luck.",3
Restaurants,"If you're in the mood for fast, delicious Chinese take-out, this is the place for you. I recommend picking up your food over delivery, though I've never run into issues with delivery. 

I've had the vegetable fried rice, sesame chicken, lo mein, beef and broccoli, egg rolls, hot and sour soup. Everything is truly delicious and comforting to fulfill a Chinese take out craving. 

This is the best Chinese takeout in Madison.",5
Restaurants,"I can't wait until we get back to Chicago! So, this place was recommended by one our friends that live here so we thought we'll give it a try. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken.... why is there only ONE PIECE OF PINEAPPLE in what is suppose to be SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE! At least when I go to other Chinese restaurants in Chicago, I get red peppers, onions, and MORE PINEAPPLES! The sauce was pretty good as well as the chicken. My husband enjoyed his food which was good. Wished we checked our food before we left because we ended up sharing rice. We'll have to find another Chinese place when we visit again!",2
Restaurants,Love the mu shu!,3
Restaurants,"It's mediocre at best.   Service is very disappointing, the person made me stand there while he yelled at people in the other room in another language then started at me while I repeated, I need a pen to sign.   

Get home to an order that is hot and ok tasting but honestly it looked nothing like the pictures of the food.  If the order doesn't look or consist of the same ingredients, the pictures are simply misleading.",2
Restaurants,Basic Chinese delivery.... Have had better but in Madison I have had much much worse!!,4
Restaurants,"Health nuts (and those looking for lighter fare) will love that the food is free of heavy seasonings. But the portions are tiny and, my God, is the service here slow and rude. Perhaps that's why Sushi San, despite occupying one of the most visible spots in the food court, attracts hardly any customers even during peak hours. Once I asked for rice and vegetables in separate containers (as opposed to one on top of the other in a cramped bowl, making it impossible to enjoy the two together). The server flatout refused without even a trivial apology.",2
Restaurants,"The Good:
SO and I both ordered Unagi bowls. The unagi itself was good, and that's the only reason I gave this two stars instead of one. 
The Bad:
The veggies served with it were not great, and it did not come with miso soup, unlike all of their other ""bowls"". Also, it took an extremely long time to receive our relatively simple meals, around fifteen-twenty minutes. This was because he completely forgot about us and only remembered when my SO went up and to ask about the food. Moreover, he and I watched as the worker (probably also the manager) argued with a customer, saying that she had already received her food, when it was clear it was a different girl who happened to order the same item. 

Overall, would not return, especially with Sushi Ichiban so close, and with more reasonable prices.",2
Restaurants,"You get a mix of people here. Townies. Professors. Grad students. Undergrads.

The interior is really nice. Wood. Pretty handblown glass lamps. Etc.
You can come in with a big group of people and find a spot to takeover. 
Pool tables. Darts. Foose.
Cute, friendly waitresses.
Good drink specials.
Live music - for free.

Overall low-key and a good time.",4
Restaurants,"Good atmosphere, friendly service and awesome life music. There's karaoke as well. So, you can sing your heart out if you want to.",3
Restaurants,"I really wanted to like this place, but had a bad experience. 

1st time I went - I ordered nachos and they came with ""squeeze cheese"" mixed with shredded cheese. They were okay nachos, but slightly disappointing with the squeeze cheese...Next time I went, I requested only shredded cheese and had the squeeze cheese on the side in case I felt like dipping. As I was sitting at the bar munching, a cockroach crawled across the bar...I am having a difficult time getting that memory out of my head and have not gone back since!",1
Restaurants,I just heard The Office closed it's doors for good - shocking...,1
Restaurants,"My favorite bar. I moved away and it closed.
Sad",5
Restaurants,"The Office is permanently closed. New business in same location is now V. Picasso, an upscale tapas bar owned by Victor Fuentes, which opened October 6, 2009.",1
Public Services & Government,"Well, I can't say that I have experienced everything that this institution has to offer, but from my experience today, I certainly have a high opinion of this place.

I'm a teacher, who has just recently moved from California to Arizona.  I had been dealing with this institution remotely (by phone and mail) up to today, when I actually went into the building to get some credentialing paperwork processed.

From the moment I entered, I received nothing but friendly service.  The woman who processed my paperwork was fast, thorough and answered all of my questions.  I left with a provisional credential good until 2014 and a smile on my face.  

In my time in Arizona, I have run into educators who are less than efficient in what they do.  I can't say that about the people that I dealt with at the Dept. of Ed.  Great folks--thank you very much for your willingness to be so helpful.",5
Public Services & Government,"Very nice customer service system, especially for a government run establishment. The receptionist is very warm and friendly with her greeting. It sweetened the deal that there was no long line of people waiting. Online it states that they close at 4:30PM however the sign on the door says 5PM. Since I'm usually fashionably late, their hours worked in my favor.",5
Restaurants,Bomb ass tacos y mariscos!! If you don't speak Spanish don't worry they can give u a gringo menu lol.  The marlin tostada was the shit! No rosarito but good enuff!!!,5
Restaurants,I do like the food here. Big bonus is that they are open 24/7 over the weekend. I ordered the chicken chimichanga combo. It was good. I will revisit again soon.,3
Restaurants,"I'm not one to write horrible reviews, and the 2 stars are because their food is good. Their service is horrible, it's chaos in here, we didn't get our order taken, we moved from one table to another just to get recognized. We didn't have a waitress/ waiter. The food is really good they just need help with their structure and it would be a 4 star place easily.",2
Restaurants,"It is very sad that this place used to be ""the place"" for tacos! We used to wait hours to get served back in the day. Now, they have so much room and the SERVICE SUCKS and the food quality is horrible. Old meats, waitresses that never, ever, come and check on you. My family is from Sinaloa, and Sinaloa food is above these standards! 
Que triste que antes este lugar era una fregoneria de lugar! Ahora todo save a viejo, el servicio es lo peor que llo eh recibido! La mesera nunca nunca vino a rellenarnos los  pepinos, nos dieron 3 limones contaditos! Soy 100% sinaloense y este restaurante no es buen representante de la comida! Aparte super caros, ni que fueran tacos gourmet. Me da mucha pena escribir este comentario por  que como Mexicana el chiste es apoyar negocios Mexicanos! Lo peor Es que tan bonito que esta el restaurante! 

Ay caretas mas buenas, baratas y mejor servicio que este restaurante!",1
Restaurants,"Best shrimp burro's. If it wasn't in the hood & make me cringe @ the thought of going in at night alone, I maybe would have given it 5 stars. 
The staff is as friendly as any other Mexican spot. The place is kept decently clean. Don't let the outside totally deter you from at least stepping foot in the place. There's a couple TV's playing Mexican music video's to get your mind off of waiting for your order, which is surprisingly fast. Call in orders are necessary when your trying to beat the lunch rush. But any other time, you could be out the door in 10 minutes. 
This place has been here for a while now. There is other La Salsita spots to go to in the valley. Some tweaked their spelling but all in all, best shrimp burro on this side of Van Buren!",4
Restaurants,"I have been going to this place for years. They used to set up a grill outside on Friday and Saturday nights and sell tacos. There would be a huge line and I would go every week but they said the city made them stop doing it. 
Still one of the best places in Phoenix for authentic Mexican tacos. I love the tacos, try them all! Shrimp burritos are good also and try the ceviche tostadas. 

They have Salcitas all over the valley but for some reason I would drive a bit further to go to this one as they were better. I think it was one of the first ones they built.

This place is ""in da hood"" and most people you will see here speak better spanish than english but if you love authentic Mexican tacos like I do this is a great place to go!",5
Restaurants,"This place is surprisingly nice on the inside and has a wide array of menu options.

This is not just another ***bertos it is a hybrid seat down place.

You sit, get a menu that's not on the wall, and then order to a person at your table.  The menu if full of great options from traditional plates and Mexican fare like burritos and tacos, to less seen in the gringo world real gorditas.

Your meal will start with chips that come with some salsa bean mix on top.  I am not sure if it is veg so be sure to ask them to leave it off if you care. There is a salsa bar with one of the best red salsas I have had in a long time, green salsa, avocado dip, carrots, pico and a crock pot of beans again probably not veg.

Prices are pretty good my chillie rellno plate was on special for $6 a huge plate with rice beans tortillas (corn or flour) and a great large chillie rellno.

Sure this may be a bit west of the trendy down town but it's worth a try.",4
Restaurants,I don't know how they pass their health inspection. This place is pretty bad in my opinion. I may be wrong about it but I'll stick with my experiences on this one. Find another Mexican Food Restaurant in the area if you're really craving.,1
Restaurants,"Great food. Very authentic. Had tacos de chicarron, cabeza and consome ""bichy"".. Delicious. Good customer service.",5
Restaurants,Me.gusta la comida lo malo que no hay control para sentarse y yo cometi el error de invitar a dos parejas mas y avia mesas grandes con solo dos personas y nosostros que eramos 6 no podiamos sentarnos,4
Restaurants,"Love it here.. The birria de chivo is on point! Also the tacos are great too!!! They are big enough to make two tacos. Plus I love that they have bichis so when u want to order other items besides birria you can still have a little ""taste"" of birria",5
Restaurants,"The best Mexican food in Phoenix no doubt!
Now serving fresh hand made tortillas the tacos taste amazing. I like the Birria and the chicharon tacos and everything else great variety and fresh tasty waters !",5
Restaurants,"Greatest food!! It is the Mexican equivalent of Portillio's, amazing experience authentic really enjoyed my visit!!",5
Restaurants,"After My court, I was hungry so I looked for a Mexican restaurant near by and I found this one with a 5 star rating so I had to try it, and I wasn't expecting less, food was awsome and in a good portion.",5
Restaurants,The food here is always amazingly good. It is very authentic and fresh. In my opinion the place needs more space because it is always insanely packed. I've gone to the restaurant many times but have had to change my order to take out because there are no tables to sit at.,4
Restaurants,Great Mexican Food...tacos are always on point. My husband always orders the seafood.,4
Restaurants,"This is the only place that my Japanese BIL will go for Chinese, outside of his own kitchen. The food is quite amazing, but the atmosphere leaves a little to be desired (explaining the four stars).

Their menu is HUGE and they don't just have your run of the mill Chinese. Although I've never been bold enough to try some of the more authentic dishes, I have seen some of the most amazing things come out of the kitchen! Whole fish flash fried and served up like filleted works of art, ducks with their heads on (ala A Christmas Story), vegetables that I don't know the names of, and platters of sizzling noodles topped with exotic sauces. Most dishes can be made to your liking if you are put off by spicy, but my preference is for the full flavored versions.

The dining area is one large room and is sometimes a little on the warm side. Take out can solve this, but I think you actually get more when you eat in, so I generally stay and take home the leftovers. Service is typically fast and always friendly as it is a family run establishment that even the kids are involved in. Portions are family style and although you can easily get away with a meal under 10$ per person, 12$ to 15$ will guarantee you a veritable feast!

I typically base my reviews of ethnic establishments on the percentage of patrons that share the same background and Big Wong's is a mainstay for the Asian community here in Phoenix. Next time you are in the area, stop in, order a poo poo platter (he he I said poo poo) and prepare for a feast of the sensations.",4
Restaurants,"Big Wong just gave me a food-gasm!

Being Wong virgins, Hubby and I decided to get the Family Style Dinner so we could try a wide variety of menu items. The waitress/owner warned us it was a lot of food, and she did not lie. 

We started with a bowl of delicious egg drop soup which was quite eggy and also chock full of sliced veggies. Next came the po-po platter with flavorful and perfectly cooked tempura shrimp, beef stick (cooked to medium, very tender and tasty), pork ribs so tasty my ""I don't eat things with bones"" Hubby sucked it clean, yummy veggie egg rolls, and the best crab rangoons I have had in a long time. 

Already getting full, the entrees came next and they were so good we had to have some of each. We ordered the stir-fried scallops which came with plenty of fresh and crunchy veggies in a light garlic sauce, and the house lo-mein which was full of shrimp and pork and chicken. The noodles were perfectly cooked and flavorful. It all came with a heaping side of fried rice which seemed to have as much pork pieces, egg, shrimp, and veggies as rice. It was a ridiculous amount of food and we have more than enough left over for dinner tomorrow. It really struck me that the meat was of a higher quality than at almost any other Chinese restaurant I have been to in the Valley, and they also know how to prepare and cook seafood properly- a Phoenix rarity. 

Having read online that they make their own ice cream, Hubby and I simply had to try it. They have two flavors: coconut with chopped peanuts on top and a bright green one that gets some flavor from coconut, but the rest of the flavor and its color from a Chinese leaf that the owner says they use a lot in making desserts. Both were absolutely delicious. A little more icy than the super-premium double-churned ice creams most of us are used to, but I thought it was really light and refreshing.

But- the owner gave us some potentially bad news. They are having some lease renewal disagreements, and may close by the end of the year, and may or may not open at another location. Go, go, go to Big Wong and experience this culinary treasure before it's too late. Hours are 11:00-2:30 M-F and 5:00-10:00 every night for dinner.",5
Restaurants,"Lunch was great.  We had a choice of egg drop or hot and spicy soups, an egg roll and many choices of beef, seafood, chicken, pork dishes yet not many vegetarian dishes if any.  The hot and spicy soup was both taste and spicy.  The Mongolian beef was ordered spicy and by adding a teaspoon of the crushed red peppers, it was perfect for my very spicy palate. The food was taste and the meal was reasonably priced. This is worth the drive.",4
Restaurants,"I have confirmed the rumors that Big Wong will be closing before the end of the year. The owners have been locked in to a lease they assumed for the last 15 years and with the down-turning economy aren't able to continue.

If you want a very reliable meal in a super friendly environment, rush on over before they close their doors forever.  : (",4
Restaurants,"I've been going to Big Wong for at least a decade (even in the old location) and am very sad to hear that they are closing/closed.

Gina and the rest of the staff have always treated me like family and I can't believe that it's going to be gone.

In all that time, I have NEVER EVER had a bad dish. EVER. I've eaten practically the entire menu and visited so often when I lived closer that they would put in my appetizer order before I even got a table. Many of my friends were introduced to this place by me, and when visiting from as far away as Alaksa would ask me to go there when in town.

If they do reopen somewhere else, I'll be 1st in line for some paper wrapped chicken!",5
Restaurants,"Big Wong has closed. There is a sign on the door directing customers to Peter Wong Chinese Restaurant at 15th Ave. and Camelback.

My beloved Big Wongs is closed, Gina has packed up all of her culinary delights and retired. While I am happy for my friend and I do consider her a friend, I am sad that this gem is closed. I have enjoyed the deliciousness of Big Wongs for over 10 years, every time I would begin my take out order Gina would say Kersin how are you, 20 minutes for dumplings. I miss my Gina! 

I sooooooo miss her Walnut shrimp w/ mayonnaise :( 
By far the best EVER! 
Her egg rolls were so fresh and not greasy, the veggies would crunch when you bite in. 
Moo Shu pork OMG 
Pan fried dumplings the sauce can not be beat 
Mongolian beef was sublime! 

If you never ate here you never ate great Cantonese!

During the WORST of my days, I lived super close. ALWAYS PERFECT!. Whizzed thru the drive-thru tonight... and was treated like royalty. 
Jack-In-The-Box is by far the most fantastic junk food chain, but this location in particular has an incredibly friendly staff.",5
Restaurants,Horrible customer service! Used drive thru and even though  I asked for hot sauce I didn't get it or napkins! Like hello? If I'm using DT obviously I will need some! Ugh! The food dry and old... Never going back there I'm surprised it's still on business.,1

Alfredo's Deli is not a deli... it is a road side burrito house with a walk up window and tables outside to sit on. 

Alfredos has been around since the 70's and the the current owner has been there since 1990. He bought it from the Orig owners when they retired. He is very friendly and personable. 

They make mainly Mexican food with some American food mixed in. 

I had a Green Chili burrito and chips with salsa. The burrito was plenty big but not overly huge. The chips were fresh and thick. Although I enjoyed the meal there was nothing to bring me back. I wish it did.",3
Restaurants,Red chilli is very good beef tacos are awsome!!!,4
Restaurants,"My friend and I went on a quest for some cheap but still good mexican food. We spent 12 dollars between the two of us and did not get what we paid for. First, we actually had to run to Circle K to get cash since they don't accept cards. Then when we finally got our food and got home, we were underwhelmed. The taco was equivalent to Jack in the Box, the rice was no good and the burrito was just bland. So skip this taco stand and go to one of the 500+ mexican food places in downtown Phoenix.",2
Restaurants,"This is my Saturday morning spot! I have not had anything but great and personable service here, and the food is uniquely good! This establishment is cash only, so come prepared. Also, being located in Sunnyslope, outside seating will add a lot of interest to any meal. DON'T FEED THE WILDLIFE! LOL.

Try any of his breakfast burritos with green sauce and be prepared to come back for more

Restaurants,"I love this place. If you want the best breakfast burrito known to mankind than please stop here and try the green chili sauce burrito with egg and bacon. It's on the menu, you can't miss it.  I go here at the very least 3 times a month, so good!",5
Restaurants,I've been coming here for a few years now and their carne asada tacos and bomb. And I thought they were called Salsitas..,5
Restaurants,Went Sun: 3/17/13.  Food & drinks were terrible. (I've eaten at the Salsita on 67th & Thomas & that place has the best Tacos & drinks-5 stars) But this place on 43rd was awful. I ordered 3 tacos de cabeza. Tortillas were hard & cold & the meat looked more like lengua & it was just bad all the way around & my Jamaica drink tasted AWFUL with a bad after taste-chalky-Ewww! I didn't return my food but I just know NOT to EVER go back to this place again-Ever!  Find another Salsita...not this one..,1
Restaurants,"It's 3am on a Wednesday morning, and you can't walk straight. With a stomach that's only known a liquid diet for the last six hours, you tell your DD this will be much better than Jack in the Box. The night's been full of questionable decisions...one more couldn't hurt, right?

La Salsita has a nice array of different meats and veggies all ready to be loaded into a tortilla. If you want something quick like a burrito, it's like Chipotle for people who aren't afraid of Mexicans.",4
Restaurants,"La Salsita? It IS SALSITAS... Awesome find, hope you try it! Conveniently OPEN 24/7, great food, nice people. They have a great variety for customizing your burritos, they don't nickel & dime you - like for adding guacamole to your burrito for example. In fact, they even have a guacamole sauce with their salsas & fresh lemons & sliced radish/salad  condiments you can serve yourself. You get your fresh horchata or colada from a separate server on the side. They also have Sangria & many other bottled drinks. They have quite a few tempting deserts, flan & fresh fruit t & fried treats but I've always been too full to even finish a burrito! They are very generous proportions & they have great chile relleno's!!! (Hey a good relleno ain't easy!) They aren't the cheapest, but worth the price. If you want cheap, stick to bean & cheese, or taco's either way it's real food & you'll get plenty. SO why it's not 5 stars... It's kinda funky for sit-in, but there's a drive through. If you habla espagnol it may be easier, if not as entertaining. I've ended up buying two of something a couple of times, & tried a couple surprises; if you really want to be sure it's done a certian way it's best to go inside & watching them put it together through the glass is pretty cool too. Even when you get just what you ordered, it seems there's always extra food - Oh, well, it makes great leftovers!",4
Restaurants,"Tacos are awesome. Tons of different meats & salsa to choose from. The best Piña Colada drink I've ever had!!! It's a hole in the wall, but my favorite place to get tacos in Phoenix and they also had tripas that was crispy good.",5
Restaurants,"I went to the one off of 43rd and McDowell 9/28/2013 around 1:50 am.  The place was a little grungy, but I didn't care too much b/c I was taking it to go.  Anyhow, I got rolled tacos with guacamole and a cheese quesadilla.  The quesadilla was as expected.  The rolled tacos were not very good at all.  They were mostly taco material with very, very little meat.  I've never seen a rolled taco with so little meat in my life.  Also, the guacamole they use is cut with sour creme or something, probably to save cost b/c avocados can be expensive, it made the guacamole taste gross.  There are so many other quick Mexican joints out there besides this one.  I would skip this place and chose somewhere else,... Hell, even Taco Bell would have been better.",2
Restaurants,"The food is great. Salsitas has great good at a great value. I just ordered 3 tacos, but I would of been fine with just two since they are a good size and are well served. I haven't tried the burritos yet because they are way too big. They make their own tortillas right in front of you. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the location is in poor condition, clean but in need of an upgrade. They have great Aguas frescas.",4
Restaurants,For a place open late and those who don't mind Mexican food at any hour I can't think of another place to go eat at 3AM. They have a good selection and prices are decent. I had their tacos de al pastor which is my go to meal when I'm trying out a new taqueria and they were good. Definitely worth checking out especially after drinking all night... really hits the spot.,4
Restaurants,"This place is only getting one star because of the food alone. This location by far has the worst customer service !! I went through the drive thru and there speaker doesn't even work they tell u just to pull forward . So when I pull up , the girl is rude and writes the order on her arm? ? I get home and they forget two burritos. So I call back and tell them and the girl that answered spoke no English (I speak both) but I would think they should have the person taking orders and answering the phones be able to speak English. So she passes the phone to someone else who says they didn't have the two burritos written down . Obviously not, she wrote it on her arm. They laughed and hung up. If you do go to the place, get off instead of going through the drive thru. But your better off going to Federico's across the street",1
Restaurants,"Yesterday morning a friend and I were craving a breakfast burrito and all the places nearby (downtown Phoenix) weren't open until 9 or 10am.  My friend suggested La Salsita since he's been to other locations and they rocked.  Found out this was the closest to us so we drove over.  

The cashier didn't speak a lick of english and I don't speak much spanish so it was a bit interesting trying to order.  I was really surprised that she didn't speak any english (or at least pretended not to).  I was able to order our breakfast burritos and luckily they came out correct.  I know there is a heavy hispanic influence in this area but I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person to ever go in here that doesn't speak spanish.  

My chorizo burrito was fine, just had too much chorizo and no other flavors came through.  Would have been better with potatoes in it.  My friend had the steak breakfast burrito and he had one bite and spit it out, the steak was not steak and tasted like rat.  Soooo nasty!  

There are so many great little local mexican restaurants nearby that taste better and easier to order.",1
Public Services & Government,"I'm not sure why I eat at IHOP, especially after reading so many reviews of great breakfast places in the Scottsdale area. 

I will try a local place tomorrow and leave this review alone.

Ewww to IHOP.",2
Public Services & Government,"The services suck, my friend and I when there a week ago, after talking our orders we never saw our waitress again, she never check on us to see how we where doing if we needed drink, napkins.. etc.  Worse customer service ever..",1
Public Services & Government,Don't come here at night! They take to long. The eggs were watery and the bacon undercook. Also dont be here around 6-8am they take forever and forget your food!! Worse service ever.,1
Restaurants,"Best place in town for a great burger and fries!   The buns are really good, high quality.   The waitress (Mothers Granddaughter) is sweet and gives solid service.  For the quality and size of food,  great priced!!",4
Restaurants,"I love this place!!!! Great people, great drinks, great prices and overall just a awesome atmosphere!!!! Lol just a tip the stalls don't have doors in the bathroom which in my opinion gives it character but for the uptight it might not be for u.... Love love the food!!!!!! Everything is awesome!!!! But overall I love the street signs with the bullet holes in the patio and inside really makes it look bad ass",5
Restaurants,"Great, legendary hole in the wall in a rather undesirable area of west Phoenix.  The Burgers are nice and juicy, ad a little salt&pepper and enjoy.  Fries are nice and crispy, buns are super soft and fresh, excellent, friendly service.  A nice place to stop for a good burger and a cold beer if you're ever out in that area!",5
Restaurants,"Mothers has been a great place forever. Not fancy, They have great sandwiches & burgers. The onion rings are great. We take visitors from out of town here regularly",4
Restaurants,"I used to go to this place as a kid. Was in the area and thought I would stop in for a burger. I had the chili burger. The burger was obviously one of those frozen, pull the paper off and slap it on the grill patties. It wasn't good. The chili was a runny, cheap, out-of-the-can type. Also not good. At least I can say I went back after 25 years. I probably won't be back for another 25.",2
Restaurants,"Sunny B. dragged me out to her pal's kiddy birthday party at a park somewhere in Glendale. Being that we had earlier been to Dick's Hideaway for breakfast & requisite Mimosa's by the time we left the kiddy party we were ready for a cocktail. The rule was - next bar or restaurant with a bar we see we're stopping. Boy did we luck out. Not the divey-ist of dives, the Dunes really fit the bill. An oasis in the desert, on the border of Glendale and Phoenix but I guess technically in Phoenix. Friendly bartender. Old men day drinking. Sunny B. instantly made friends- with this old guy that insisted upon showing her his ""donkey"". After multiple offers to show Sunny his donkey, she finally consented. I was on the edge of my seat....

Strong drinks. Strong.

BOTTOM LINE: Drop on by, you might get to see a donkey",3
Restaurants,If you like DUIs or like people driving out on the street wasted without being cut off by a bartender then this is the place for you!!!! They will serve you to the point that you can barely walk and then watch you drive off into the sunset. But dont worry the customer service doesnt end there ~ Your bartender will even send you a cute little text message (because she knows you are beyond wasted) just to make sure you got home okay.... LOL if you have to send a customer a text message to make sure they got home okay then uummmmmmm hint maybe you shouldnt have served them so much and just maybe hopefully the liquor board will investigate this shaddy bar. I use to bartend and in no way shape of form should anyone be allowed to drink as much as this bar does without cutting them off!!!! This bar is a danger to our roads...,1
Restaurants,"I stopped in for a beer. The parking is good, its cool inside and you can't beat the prices. Cheap beer and 50 cents to shoot pool. Its very clean and open, not the usual dive bar. Its very low key and the bartender was very friendly. i'm going to hit this place in the evening. They seem to have some great after 6 specials.",4
Restaurants,Stop by for a beer Sat. they are charging 3.50 a bottle. I won't be stopping there again.,1
Restaurants,I visited The Dunes recently. They've got some great bartenders now and they've lowered some prices. There is video bowling and darts on the one side and pool tables on the other. The juke box is amazing. It contains a huge amount of my favorite songs. The people are very welcoming and friendly.  I would recommend it as a cool place to hang out.,5
Restaurants,"I stopped in last week and got into their free Texas Holdem game.  Nice crowd and cheap liquor made it a good time. I came back the next morning and they remembered me, which was cool. Over all I like this place as a clean cheap neighborhood bar.",4
Restaurants,"I like this place. Cheap drinks and friendly bartenders. I tend to stay away during the weekends because it gets super loud to the point you can't have a conversation and there's karaoke. I'm not a big fan of karaoke. 

The crowd is diverse. Some shady others not so much. The bartenders are cool and remember your name. 
Pool tables darts and poker makes it a worthy place to check out during the week. Ladies night is Wednesday's and they have $1 shots too.",3
Restaurants,"Just recently moved a few block's away from this place. We had my brother in law over this past Sat and he wanted to go somewhere for a drink. He said he loved dive bars. Which I'm certainly not opposed to. Some of my favorite bars have been considered dive bars. So we decided to give this place a chance. Shouldn't have wasted our time. Walked in and no hello from the bartender. Stood at the bar for 8 mins with not a single I'll be right with you or single hello. Meanwhile the bartender has time to hug other customers , refill other drinks, check herself out in the mirror, everything but help us. I should have known when we walked in and the entire bar turned around and starred at us like we were from out of town. No, we are locals. The bar wasn't even busy literally just the bar had about 8 people at it. So we walked out and went to try The Hideaway on Northern. That bartender needs to give the one at The Dunes a lesson in customer service. She welcomed us and said hello as soon as we walked in. That's bar 101. No worries, Caroline at the Hideaway got our tips that afternoon. The Dunes I'd never go back to. The Hideaway we would.",1
Restaurants,"2.5 

HTB is your average American style buffet. No frills or thrills here. 

The kids enjoy eating here because they can pick what they want and it always includes some form of sugar at the end. 

The salad was fresh, but the salad choices were slim. 
The Roast beef was cooked more then i prefer but had good flavor. 
The pasta with chicken was good, added salt. 
The potatoes au gratin were really good. They added potato chip to the top lol. 
The rice was good, added salt 
The banana bread cake thing was good but a little dry. 

The staff was excellent, Bob kept the table clean and asked if we needed anything, but without being in my face. 

The manager guy gave me a good deal too. @ kids @ $.99 and mine @ senior price. The 3 of us at for $12.00. Not too bad (plus 1/2 star)",3
Restaurants,"Went here for breakfast...
The first thing I noticed was the weird smell from the parking lot. The restaurant is located right off the freeway in an old plaza. The entire building looked old and run down.

The lady waiting my table brought drinks and silverware to the couple sitting a 3 tables down. I did not get the same service. I found that odd.

The food selection was poor. They only eggs they had were scrambled eggs and eggs sunny side up. The bacon tasted very gamey and the pork sausage was dry. Most of the items looked like they had been sitting out for a while.

For less than $8 what can you expect? I would try another home town buffet but would not go to this specific one again.

Also the bathroom was a 4 out of 10 in terms of cleanliness. It smelled and looked liked it had not been cleaned that morning.",1
Restaurants,"Still about the same. The kids price is $1.99 and the adult was over $11 something. The kids really like eating here, they can get whatever they want. 

I usually get the salad, which is always a good start. Then head over to the roast beef and mashed spuds. The roast beef was tough but the pot roast was excellent. The ribs were good too.",3
Restaurants,"Owned by the same parent company as Old Country, and much of the same food, but just not as good (or should I say not as mediocre?)

This location is close to my job and they give a 20% discount if i show my badge, so I end up here sometimes even though it's not so great.

The food's ready to grab and eat, so that works well for lunch hour.

The digs are showing their age and wear and tear, but most of the bussers seem to keep things tidied up (as they try to earn a tip from you, even though they don't even get you drinks anymore)

Pretty much everything here used to be better a few years ago.  The last several visits I've encountered things like wilted spinach one visit only to have my complaint remedied by NO spinach on the next couple visits.  That's what i get for being picky i guess!

Your lunch here will consist of such delicacies as cheese enchiladas, cheese pizza, macaroni & cheese, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, corn bread, spaghetti, chicken dumplings, soup, jello, and an iceberg/romaine lettuce mix, and a few other things.  
'tsabout it.
...day in and day out, with an occaisional 'teriyaki' chicken & white rice or grade-school-cafeteria-grade 'meat' patty on dried bun, or something like that thrown in to keep you on your toes.

They used to offer both ice cream and yogurt in soft serve machines, but usually it's only one or neither.  Just like the main courses and sides, the dessert selection just isn't what it used to be.

The creme brulee and prime rib must be held back until the weekend when they charge that $2 more.",2
Restaurants,"CLOSED, but I posted a pic of a funny sign posted on their door.",2
Restaurants,closed,1
Restaurants,I love Carl's Jr and I can't wait until this one reopens!,4
Restaurants,"I always try the current 6 Dollar burger special they have. 
The food is always just so so. It always seems a little cold like they let things sit around too long before slapped together and tossed in a sack. They are always friendly and the interior is clean, but the food quality is sub-par at best.",2
Restaurants,Great for those lazy days where you don't want to cook,4
Restaurants,"OMG!!! large fries were cold, soggy, limp and half full, chicken strips were the same and chewy, shake was warm and melted
Horrible experience",1
Restaurants,I'm always down for their food but they have the slowest service ever.. Only worth going if you have a free day.,2
Restaurants,I guess I'll have to give up one star but how can you only have a 3 piece and a 20 piece chicken stars. My chicken club was prepared haphazard don't know how everyone else's order was but I think I'm done with this place:-(,1
Restaurants,"Well it's OK could be better let me share a few thoughts and observations

If you work the Night shift like I do and stop in there let's say around 2 o'clock in the morning to get something to eat your going to find yourself getting very cold fries or ones that are hard as a brick they probably been laying around for a few hours, and you may find your Burger not hot at all actually try cold 

I mean think about it you get off work it's late you stopped there to get something to eat and all you get for your 15 bucks is a cold burger and cold fries and its not like this is a one time thing this happen like seven times in the last three months",2
Restaurants,"Our visit wasn't bad at all. We were in the area for some foster parenting training. Stopped by for a quick bite to eat. We walked right in, gave our order. And what I like about Carl's Jr, they will deliver your food to you at your table. Everyone was nice, received our food pretty quickly. Place was very clean.
I tried their limited time only bourbon BBQ burger, very good. Other then that, food is like any other fast food franchise. It's OK. We had a good experience here.",4
Restaurants,"Absolutely FILTHY! Took the kids for an ice cream after a hike in the Sonoran preserve and noticed how dirty the seats, tables and especially the floors were. It opened our eyes to notice how really disgusting, inside and outside, the adjoining Circle K store and the bathrooms are as well! We went back again today, after another hike, for another ice cream and the exact same crud that was on the floor and seats was still there 5 days later! This burger king has been shut down before and I predict it will be shut down again. This is an embarrassment to our beautiful neighborhood. It's right across the street from the Sonoran preserve. This business needs new management and a thorough cleaning...... and remodeling I might add. It is decorated like a 1970's little girls room, all in lavender.",1
Restaurants,"Worst service ever. They were out of fresh catchup. I asked them if they had anymore or if they could fill the container back up. A mgr behind the table offered me package catchup. I informed her that I would rather have fresh catchup. She rolled her eyes and as someone to go fill it. When employee said are we out she reply ""I guess"". At no point after employee fill the container the mgr come to tell me or offer to bring some to the table. 
Keep your money and go to Mc Donald where your business is appreciated.  
This place is inside of a gas station with very poor attitude.",1
Restaurants,This is the closest Burger King to our house so we go there quite a bit.  It isn't always the neatest restaurant but they always get our order right & the drive thru moves really fast.,3
Restaurants,Under new management. Complete remodel has been done. Always clean now and service is much better.,4
Restaurants,"KC should get a rase.  He is a great employee, hard working unlike most people. Good food and made my night...",5
Restaurants,I received a vanilla brownie Sunday instead of chocolate. Second time my order has been screwed up or they have forgotten something.,1
Restaurants,"Went here last night to get their 44oz water and a snack before work. When I ordered I was told my total and to pull forward. I was in the drive thru line for OVER 35 MINUTES!! Finally about 10 minutes at a standstill I asked one of the servers what the problem was; to which he rattled off a few kitchen machined were out of order and there was nothing he could do and quickly told me he would ""just cancel my order"". I replied ""excuse me?"" He sighed and walked off. Finally about 30 minutes after I ordered I asked to speak with the manager, who was polite and the only reason my rating isn't ZERO STARS! I explained I am irritated I have been in line for over a half hour because the machines weren't working and if I ordered something that required that machine why didn't they let me know it might take a while since by this point I am late for work!! Needless to say, horrible management, even worse customer service and I will NOT be returning to this location!!",2
Restaurants,It's like they took all the worst employees at surrounding fast food restaurants and stuck them here. They've gotten one out of 5 drive through orders right. Don't go here,1
Restaurants,If I could give less than 1 star I would. Worst Sonic ever! This place should be shut down. Food was wrong and tasted like it was left overs from last week.,1
Restaurants,"I like getting a breakfast burrito from Sonic before work, but this is the SLOWEST Sonic I have ever been to. Maybe the slowest drive-through fast-food ever, and the annoying thing is that it's ALWAYS slow. I often see cars waiting in the drive-through just drive away before getting their food because the wait is so long. It doesn't stop me from coming here because I love the breakfast burritos, but I sure don't come here very often because of it.",1
Restaurants,"Tonight marks the worst fast food restaurant experience I have ever encountered.  This is the last time I will ever visit a Sonic. No other fast food chain I have visited has given me a worse experience than the Sonic on Mckellips Dr. First of all, my son's order was screwed up twice. Then my husband went to pick up his drink, and the lid wasn't properly on the cup and it spilled all over him and his food. Lastly, not knowing that pretzel buns are only for hotdogs, I asked for one on my chicken sandwich and they used 2 hotdog buns and didn't even tell me they don't offer sandwich pretzel buns. Plus, they charged me 2 extra dollars for this creation. This isn't the first time I've had issues with this Sonic. Something is ALWAYS screwed up in the order or the location is out of ice cream. Not only that, any time I call to speak with the manager, they don't care. They barely offer an apology. This restaurant is pathetic and I have many choices in the area, so this will be my last visit to Sonic, or any Sonic for that matter.  It seems that Sonic has no intention of bettering their restaurants. What a shame. Beware and stay away!!",1
Restaurants,Garbage made by teenagers that look like they're out on parole. I also smelled marijuana coming from the dumpster area.,1
Restaurants,One of the few Sonics that usually have ice.,4
Restaurants,I got their corn dog and it sucked. It wasn't even crispy! Their only saving grace is their variety of shakes and drinks. The chocolate milk shake was great!,3
Restaurants,By far the slowest service I have ever gotten. I should have gone to the grocery store and cooked something(would have been quicker) I do not understand how you can go to a fast food joint and be the only ones there and still take 30 minutes to get the food. It is sad because I always liked Sonic.,1
Restaurants,This is the WORST location ever! The last time I will ever go there. I've had a number of bad experiences. They always get my order wrong. I've been over charged twice. The employees don't care and the wait is soooo long! I always see cars leaving the drive thru line bc the wait is so long. I love buying thier bags of ice but not at this location any more. Going to start going to a different location.,1
Restaurants,"Oh. My. Gosh. So. Slow. I am in the drive through as we speak. I've had time to go through my Facebook, Instagram, email and have time to spare. I'm literally just sitting here waiting. All I ordered was ice cream. Just waiting for the car ahead of me. It's been at least 15 minutes.  I actually was here earlier today for a kids meal. Took at least the same amount of time. So much for fast food.",1
Restaurants,"Hmmm. Now what to say about this one that won't embarrass me and/or my husband too much :)  Let's just say, it's good but it ain't THAT good.

Now that that's over, the Better Than Sex Cake Cafe is above average for a cafe, especially one as small as this one is (7-10 tables in a hole-in-the-wall). Try not to be put-off by the name or the slightly shabby location and drop in for lunch one day. They offer a good selection of sandwiches, salads, pizza, and a few really tasty soups. They also have excellent quiche. 

Now for the cake. In case you hadn't heard of this recipe of cake before, here's the concept in a nutshell: You bake a chocolate cake (from scratch is better of course but a cake mix will do), and after the cake is out of the oven, poke holes in the top with the end of a wooden spoon or something similar. Drizzle fudge, caramel, and sweetened condensed milk into the holes, so the whole thing is soaked through. Then top with crushed chocolate-toffee candy bars, whipped cream, and a few more toffee bar crumbles for good measure. There are a lot of varieties, but you get the idea. 

At the Better Than Sex Cake Cafe they serve three different of these cakes. You'll just have to come in and decide for yourself if they are really better than sex...",4
Restaurants,"The name does suggest some competition and what's funny is that you can't have better than sex cake without having the thoughtful discussion around is it or isn't it. 

I'd dare say there's more sex being discussed at the little cafe tables than on an Oprah show.

My thoughts, it is good cake...",4
Restaurants,"No, cake cannot replace sex, but it definitely tastes good. I've tried both the carrot and chocolate cake, and will order the latter whenever I have a chance. 

I also have had the quiche of the day - very tasty - and their raspberry dressing is pretty yummy. 

It's not a large place and can fill up fast. They are looking to franchise if anyone is interested.",4
Restaurants,"I may improve my star rating after tasting the quiche. It looked amazing and according to the ladies sitting behind me, it was ""rich and delicious"". It was served with fresh fruit and a cup of home made soup.

Unfortunately I had the Club sandwich- minus the bacon and honey mustard dressing. The turkey was obviously from a package, and since the description read ""grilled sandwiches"" I was a little more than disappointed with the fact it was cold. I had been expecting gooey melted cheese on my fresh veggies and roasted turkey. My brother- with the same sandwich said he'd be pretty happy if he pulled this one off in his own kitchen, but being that this is a food establishment he was disappointed. The lemonade that was ""made this morning"" I'm sure had been made from a powder.

The cake was worth the drive. We ordered the Classic and devoured it. We were about to pay the check when ""cuttings"" of the Red (carrot cake) were brought out for our tasebud pleasure. The ""cuttings"" were about the same size as a regular slice and we were not charged. Very hospitable. I believe its because I made a crack about not being crazy about carrot cake and the owner felt the need to defend herself. That she did. The icing was creamy and delicious ad the cake was the most moist carrot cake I have ever had.

I'll be back to give it another try, but next time I'll sit in the cute and romantic courtyard, I'll order a quiche, and I'll stick with water or coffee. If I am not impressed, I'll try the Country Cottage (a cute cafe backing into the same courtyard) for lunch and then hit up BTSCC for cake.

Right- one more notable- the fries were fresh, crisp, and tasty. Crunchy golden on the outside and tender on the inside. Good eats.",3
Restaurants,I loved the cake--and the quiche--and the soups (French onion was great!)--and the friendly personal service--and the rubber stamp store next door!  Hope to see them again soon!,5
Restaurants,"Well  I don't know what Kind of sex they've been having, but I've never had sex that Bad!

Honestly the worst Carrot Cake I've Ever had!

Served in a big thick square, no layers, no filling, it had the consistency of wet packed sand that was thinly covered with a flavorless white frost and sprinkled with toffee chips and topped with a soggy strawberry.UGH!

I'm so glad I didn't have lunch there, and now I never will.

It was also just a weird vibe walking in there, it's located in the same shabby courtyard as the country cottage, but had no class.

To the right as I walked in was a dimly lit area that looked like a ceremonial orgy room with a shrine to the God awful cake...WTF...

There was about 4 or 5 dark haired wannabe Italian guys running around acting like waiters.........is that supposed to be a turn on to get you ready for the non-climactic cake........I think only Pasta Brioni can pull that one off but barely.

So I took 2 bites and threw it in the trash, said thanks for nothing and called my husband to tell him he had NOTHING to worry about!!

FYI...if your sex is so bad that your are resorting to that cake.....GOD HELP YOU!",1
Restaurants,"Dragged here by a quirky friend who insisted there was a restaurant down this alley that had good cake...

And she was right!  She was picking up a piece of cake for her boyfriend, and I just could not resist a slice of carrot cake.  It is a heavy duty cake as another reviewer pointed out, but I found it quite tasty and moist.  It is slab cake and not a multi layer one, but that is just different presentation to me.

Now for the name... I have to give them credit for the creative name, as it definitely sparks a discussion.  Maybe the only way to settle it once and for all is to try both at the same time...",4
Restaurants,"Ok...not better than Sex, but the cake was very good.  We got a piece of all of the cakes.  They are a bit on the more expensive side, but still very good!",4
Restaurants,"The food is good.  The service is good.  It needs a lunch special pricing in order to become a regular in the rotation.

I got the Market Street Salad with Chicken which had candied pecans and strawberries for $8.95.  It was very yummy and ultra healthy.  The iced tea was good.

I have had a number of things on the menu and nothing was ever disappointing.  I think the salad is my favorite.  The quiche was a pleasant surprise.

I have never actually tried the cakes, but they look damn good.",4
Restaurants,"Been here twice for a sandwich and piece of cake.  Both were OK. 

Service was a bit odd both times.

Nice patio atmosphere.  If their hours didn't suck it  would be a sweet place for coffee and a piece of cake in the morning.  Missed opportunity.",2
Restaurants,"Never been there ... scared away by the name. 

But I read an article that it had closed Sat. 4-11-09 so I wanted to verify that was the case so I can add it to my list of  closed businesses and things that aren't there anymore.

http://thedish.freedomblogging.com/2009/04/09/is-better-than-sex-cake-cafe-closing-saturday/6115/

Indeed it was closed. Sign says closed for the season until Oct. but the article above indicates it may be longer than that.",1
Restaurants,Three times I have stopped by here in the hopes of getting a bite to eat and was disappointed again they were closed.  Maybe next trip!,3
Restaurants,"6-16-10 - I drove by on way home from downtown - sign on wall said ""closed, thanks for your patronage over the years."" 


I see that it is open for business again, driving by 10-6-09",2
Restaurants,"I love a good buffet!  This one has many selections to choose from.  You can have all the steak you want - no limits there.  Fried shrimp, chicken & dumplings, salads, desserts.  Yum-o!  This is a very traditional American style buffet.  Adults Dinner pricing is approx. $10.99 per person - not too shabby.  Would definitely recommend",5
Restaurants,"If you want disgusting food, it can be had much more cheaply. Or for free, out of a trash bin. I suppose if you're only eating once in a while and need to stuff yourself when you do then this place is passable. Personally, I'd rather skip a meal than go here. And yes, American buffets are infamously bad, but even so this place is terrible, and rather dirty. You're better off going into [whatever supermarket is in that plaza now] and buying some food there.",1
Restaurants,"I love buffets but this place has gone down hill. I was never really that crazy about this place but it went from about a 2.5 to a 1 since the last time I was here. Mac an cheese was watery, chicken alfredo was blah. Nothing was ""bad"" it just was not good. They had some enchiladas that looked like they were from a TV dinner..  I managed to find some fish and some smoked sausage that were decent and ended up eating mostly salad as it was fresh.
I would not recommend going here and I will not be back anytime soon..",1
Restaurants,"This place is a ton of fun. Good theaming, and service. The food is great and its a good place to drop into. I recomend it enough to say very proudly that I went there twice in one day. It has to be good to do that right? Right? Go there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Chase out!",4
Restaurants,"Chase G.? That's a big ole fail on you. 240 N. Sunway in Gilbert is, in fact, a tire store. Thanks for ruining my lunch small dancing rodent!!",1
Restaurants,Loved this place from the Rt 66 decor to attentive service to delicious food! A must-stop on Rt 66.,4
Restaurants,"This place is very cool and laid back.  Apparently Unlce Bear was someone's dog b/c there are dog pics plastered all over this place.  If you are a dog or even a pet lover in general you would appreciate the decor/vibe of this grill/bar.  It is literally a ""throw your peanut shells on the floor"" joint (they come served in a dog dish) with very cold beer on tap and an eclectic mix of people that dine here.  The Gilbert location is a bit more conservative versus the East Mesa spot.  People in Gilbert seem to think it's ok to bring their small children to bars! 

I am a huge fan of the BBQ chicken quesadilla (or you can get it served as a pizza).  I really haven't tried much else on the menu b/c I can't seem to stray from my BBQ chicken; It is yummy and when I lived in the east Valley I would dine there about once a week.",4
Restaurants,"I went to lunch with my buddy, Rob M., to a place called Uncle Bear's Bar and Grill. It was actually pretty cool! I was surprised because it is in one of the more LAME areas near my house. Namely ""Warner and Cooper"".

When we entered however, it was anything BUT lame. Dog bowls on all the tables filled with mutant peanuts. Granted, it was lunch, but there really wasn't more than 3 other groups there. This led me to believe the food/service was bad. Not at all! This place rocked!

We shared some nachos in a heterosexual kinda way, and shared manly stories about football before shoving off. By the way, Rob, you owe me $15.00!!!",4
Restaurants,"What's not to love about Uncle Bears?

First, the atmosphere:  Bar with peanut shells on the floor, plenty of bar, booth or table seating, and a decent sized patio.  TVs cover your sporting or random television needs - we watched the '08 election returns there.  Then the dog pictures - I keep meaning to add my dog to the collection.  If you bring in framed photo (get the size first, I can't remember) of your dog, they will hang it.  You can even bring your pup to the patio, and the staff will bring them water.

Food and drinks:  Everything I have had here has been great.  The only thing that has ever been less than perfect was some beer tasted a little off right after they changed the keg.  We mentioned it to our server, and our drinks were replaced right away.  The food is fantastic, from the burgers to the chicken strips, and don't forget about the cheese fries!  

I love this specific Uncle Bears because they are about 4 blocks from my house, which means I can easily walk home if I'm a little tipsy.  They also do karaoke, and this one has a decent turnout of good singers.  All and all, this is a great neighborhood bar.",4
Restaurants,"We took a queue from the ""Best of"" series this weekend and checked out this little local sandwich and pizza place. 

As a rule, I'm generally not into sandwich places (see also: my review of Duck and Decanter). When the gf suggested it, I wasn't excited about the prospect of another eight dollar sandwich spilling over with strange greens that tasted like feet. 

However, on this occasion I obliged. 

When we arrived, my first reaction was to be impressed by the setup. There is a cool little fountain just outside in the corner (of the strip mall) and for a warm spring day, it was perfect. 

Inside, there was an older couple that apparently could sense that we were first-timers and were quick to assure us that we were ""in for a treat."" 

We both ordered sandwiches that were good, surprisingly good, and flavorful. I ordered a chicken sandwich with bacon and carmelized onions and it came out after a short wait with a side of mixed greens in a light dressing. 

I'm definitely planning a second visit to check out their pizza (I saw some white pizzas being cooked that looked dee-lish) and maybe another sandwich or two, as well.

So far, so good.",4
Restaurants,"Really, really nice people but not spectacularly good food.  Pretty inexpensive and interesting.  Strange kinds of pizza that are pretty awesome and some good salads.",4
Restaurants,I think this place is CLOSED. Their # is out of service.,1
Restaurants,"This is a chain burger place, but they do make the burgers fresh and let you dress them yourself.  Granted, this same scenario plays out a thousand times better at The Chuck Box in Tempe, however,  The Chuck Box lacks one thing...a nacho cheese pump!  Oh, glorious plastic cheese that you can pump on your fries to your heart's desire.  Heck, pump it on to your burger if you want!    

Three stars for the burgers and one star for the vat of cheese.",4
Restaurants,"Apparently the original name was Fuckrudder's but for some reason that didn't take off. So a few multi million dollar advertising meetings later, waaa laa, Fuddrucker's. Ahhh, c'mon, it's still fun to say. Now, is it fun to eat here? Well, back in it's hey day, I thought it was pretty fun. Design your own burger. Grab a beer. Chow down. However, the last time I ate at Fuddrucker's, it was a sad sight. The ""burger bar"" was a disaster. Nothing really interesting for toppings. Except for the artificial nacho cheese sauce perhaps. And what was there was picked over like the last bologna wrapped pickle at a trailer park picnic. And speaking of trailer parks, even though this particular Fuckrudder's, ooops, er um, I mean Fuddrucker's is in tony Scottsdale, the clientele was, was, well they scared me.",2
Restaurants,"I went to Fuddruckers simply because I was walking by it and it was lunch time and I didn't want to wait so long at Oregano's.  There is something funny yet gay in the name of Fuddruckers and that they sell fresh meat (a la Fudgefuckers).  Although the yellow awnings have always annoyed me, it does foreshadow the circus like atmosphere once you step inside.  This is one of those family restaurants that believe in throwing some old junk and memorabilia on the walls and think it's a fun local place.  If you are going to put up an old football helmet, put the whole thing up, not just half of it.  Those half ones were never used, not even in the special Olympics.  With the smell of an old garage and unsurprisingly a bunch of overweight patrons, this place was not fun and certainly not gay.  Interestingly, there were lots of skinny men in this place; they need all the protein and blood they can get.
So for 12 bucks I got the 1/2lb bacon cheeseburger and fries.  It was great the cashier (I think he was the manager, and gay to boot; must been attracted to the name) told me that the meal deal was a better deal.  That saved me like a dollar and since no tip jar was around, I stuffed it into my front pocket.
Although the steak fries were a little too peppery, they were good.  Not soggy, not overly crisp or oily.  The hamburger was good.  Not the best, but good.  It was cooked to my satisfaction.  Props to the immigrant cook staff for getting the cooking right.

+++'s:
Decent food, bottled beer on ice, friendly service, good cooks, fresh and filled condiment buffet, fun to squirt your own ketchup and mustard from the buffet area, free refills, outdoor patio, not too busy for weekday lunch time

- - -'s:
Chintzy décor, no eye candy, a tad overpriced for what you get, yellow circus awnings, drab atmosphere, no wifi

In sum, if you are in the mood for a hamburger, a quick bite to eat, and are in the vicinity of a Fuddruckers, this place delivers.  If you are looking for a real local place, fun atmosphere, and better food, look elsewhere.",3
Restaurants,"Went to a family event at Fuddruckers this week. Have a relative who digs it. Going there just gives me the willies. 

It definitely seems to have been cleaned up a bit from the last time we went. It was dirty, nasty the previous time. Little bit of solace in that. DIdn't seem as dirty. They'd reupholstered the booths with the torn vinyl. They'd gotten rid of the cracked & torn vinyl red & white striped tablecloths. Still cracked & old formica but it didn't seem as dirty.

As far as the food, I got a bacon cheeseburger that was just not very good. Ok, but nothing special at all. The fries weren't great either. In years past, I was a big fan of the plastic cheese in the heated cheese fountain but not so much either. After it cools a bit, it's just nasty.

I will go back when future family events require & maybe with less trepidation but I still wouldn't go there by choice with other good options nearby.",2
Restaurants,"So I went there at the beginning of this month with a friend...for the first time...yes believe it or not I had never been to fudd's.

It was OK...I mean not that big of deal it's a burger joint with a pick your own toppings bar...big deal...some of the nostalgia on the wall is cool.

The service was not that great..but the people that did come see us were at least friendly.",3
Restaurants,"You know how in the first Ghostbusters movie how Sigourney Weaver's apartment building was a conduit for negative and dark forces because of rituals that had transpired that caused the framework to work as an inherently evil gateway to be used by Gozer?

That's how I kind of feel about this place.  Only, instead of being a gateway for evil, it's more like a gateway for absent-minded people who will stand in your way and/or walk behind you MUCH TOO CLOSE.  You know the kind of people I'm talking about.  The people who made it why the sneeze-guard had to be invented... people so careless and dumb they'll sneeze on food.

This place is depressing.  It's true.  I mean, it's as though everyone in town who wants to bitch and moan and ooze out piss and vinegar decided to come to Fuddrucker's.  

This is a shame because I actually really enjoy the burgers.  I think they're fabulous.  And the fries are really good.  They're those potato wedges with the skins that I enjoy.  They have a make your own burger bar and their to go system is brilliant.  They give you enough cups for everything so that you can make 100% sure that your burger will NOT be soggy.  It never is.  

Plus, and this is a bonus, they have round pickle slices for your burger and they also have like those half pickles, too.  So, you can have a pickle on the side without looking like a pickle-slice collecting weirdo.

I do think the food is great, but I hate, hate, fucking HATE going inside.  It's depressing to me.  It's not dirty or filthy, but the building works as the antijoy.  It saps your joy in the same way that antimatter can make things seize to exist and create gnarly explosions.

If you can get in and out really quick, you will get a great burger.",3
Restaurants,"It's pretty good. 

One time they did have a sign in the line that said, ""8 minutes from this point"", like they were disneyland or something. 

But the burgers are good, and the fries. and the cheesy sauce is good for dipping.",4
Restaurants,"well this isn't the same fuddruckers I was last at a couple months ago, things have changed for the better.

They have jalapeno cheese sauce now. Up until today, it was the only fuddruckers I had been at that did not have it. There was also a lady in a blue shirt (manager maybe) wandering around the dining room filling drinks, asking how the food was and taking away plates. It was something I wasn't used to coming here before and was a nice touch, almost like a real live sit down restaurant. It was a great improvement since the last time I was here and it was very welcomed.",3
Restaurants,"What a fantastic restaurant!  I was in town with a business group and this was a last minute change from our originally scheduled dining destination and I'm so glad we accidentally stumbled upon this culinary oasis near Old Town Scottsdale.  Even our colleagues who work only a block away had never heard of, let alone visited, Medizona but I'm sure now they'll be back.

Billing itself on the menu as ""Mediterranean Inspired Southwestern Cuisine"" I was not sure what to expect from the exotic sounding dishes listed.  

We started out with three appetizers. The first was Blackened Shrimp with White Bean Hummus, Mango-Olive Salsa, and Charbroiled Tomatillo Sauce which was good.  Not sure I got any of the hummus but the salsa and sauce were excellent accompaniments to the large, plump (and surprisingly not overcooked) shrimp.  Next was a ""Rabbit, Fig, and Pine Nut Baklava with Quail Egg and Pomegranate Sauce."" The baklava was interesting and the flavors worked well togerther.  The quail egg came separately and I never saw the pomegranate sauce so the small fried egg on the side was an odd accompaniment. The last appetizer was ""Eggplant Tacos with Lamb, Arugula and Kasseri Cheese"" which was excellent.  

The salad of baby greens was accompanied by a small piece of roasted goat cheese that was very strong but good if taken in tiny bites with the greens.  The almond-honey brittle in the salad was interesting but made the salad a bit too sweet.

Our group hada choice of three entrees and all received glowing reviews.  I had the Achiote Rubbed Pan-Fried Salmon over Organic Lentil Polenta with Morel Mushroom-Baby Clam Sauce.  The polenta was a little dry but the salmon was cooked perfectly and the sauce was excellent.  Others had  Moroccan Spiced Chicken Breast
Black Bean-Saffron Couscous, Cilantro-Yogurt Sauce and harbroiled Prime Tenderloin of Beef over Potato-Leek Gratin, Butternut Squash, and Spinach.

Our group was trying to rush back to the hotel and most missed the incredible desserts.  I lucked out and managed to grab some to take back.  Prickly Pear Tiramisu with Turkish Coffee-Pistachio Sauce and  Chocolate Flourless Cake with Caramelized Bananas, Peanuts and Marshmallow Foam.",5
Restaurants,"I was last year about 2 years ago with a friend who treated me, and it's probably one of the better treats I've ever received (tangible treats, anyway. ""Being Awesome"" is a great intangible treat I happen to be very blessed with. Har har.). 

The restaurant was a ghost town when we were there, and it sounds like a recurring issue. No clue how they stay open, but the food is out of this world. I remember going out on a limb and trying a bunch of things I wouldn't typically and making exciting new culinary discoveries. That said, Medizona does the exotic VERY well and remains the only place I will touch lamb and veal.

I'm treating the friend that took me the first time next week - I expect it will be as amazing as we remember.

Don't worry, you'll hear about it if it isn't.",5
Restaurants,"I don't understand the reviews of the restaurant.  Either we were on an off day or this restaurant won't last another 30 days.  The food quality, service, management attentiveness was absolutley non-existent.  Some of the dishes could have been good if they were served hot and on time.  Service was horrendously slow and several of the dishes were inedible.  The Sea Bass was extremely salty, the Moroccan Chicken was cold and the medium rare lamb chops were well done.  
We complained to the servers repeatedly and to the management with no positive results.  Management appears brain dead.  They had two responses: ""We're sorry to hear that"" and ""We're utilizing a new concept"" .",1
Restaurants,"This place was so hard to find!!!! The AAA travel book was WRONG in giving directions. Luckily the host who answered the phone was very helpful in directing us to the location of the restaurant. Just remember that the cross street is 3rd Avenue and Scottsdale.

The food is A++++. First of all, the bread is delicious! I was so full just eating the 3 different versions of bread: ciabatta, cheesy jalepeno (my favorite), and olive. I had at least two slices of each bread. The white hummus and eggplant salsa went well with the bread. Our waiter was so nice to even give us more bread. 

Appetizer- Rabbit and Fig Baklava with balsamic reduction and deep fried parsnips ($10). OMG!! This is the appetizer from heaven!! The sweetness from the figs and the balsamic reduction was oh soo good. The parsnips was a good alternative to potato chips. I love the puff pastry that was the layers of the baklava. This entree by itself is worth 5 Yelp stars.

Entrees-
1) Stuffed Poblano chili with butternut squash, provolone cheese, and spinach with a side of corn risotto and tequila creme sauce ($17). Oh goodness. This dish was so delicious. I love the corn risotto and the tequila cream sauce tasted like black beans to me. This dish was comforting food.

2) Moroccan chicken breast with pearl cous cous and green  beans ($20). The chicken was overcooked :( I liked the green sauce and chipotle sauce that came with the dish. I was surprised with the amount of chicken that was given!!! The pearl cous cous was pretty tasty.

Service- EXCELLENT! Our waiter didn't rush us to finish our food, and answered any of our questions regarding the menu. He was so nice!!! A++ service.

Music- Jazz music was in the bar even on a Sunday night. 

Bathroom- Very clean, and had a stainless steal electric garbage can where you press a button to open the lid. The lid must have been broken as the lid was upwards. Anyway, men and women had separate bathrooms.

We were too full from the entree to have dessert. I would have tried the prickly pear tirimisu. 

I would love to come back here again!!!",5
Restaurants,"psssst.... c'mere...... let me let you in on something kinda cool.  Medizona might be the best restaurant you've never heard of.  I mean, really, how is this place not huge?!   I don't have the descriptors to let you know how much I like this place.  

The food here is creative, attractively presented and fantastic on the palate.  It's southwestern and mediterrenean.  Yeah, ""huh?""  I know.  I had the same reaction.  It's like Chino Bandido, it doesn't make sense, it doesn't sound like it'd work, but it does.  Go try it for yourself.   Ratatouille quesadilla.  Chorizo potato cake.  Lamb with a moussaka tart with red pepper sauce. And, of course, the prickly pear tiramisu.

Go. 

Tonight.",5
Restaurants,"This is a tiny, independent establishment... and I loved it.

I headed here for supper after a foodie friend highly recommended it. It felt more like eating in someones home rather than a restaurant. I enjoyed everything from the appetizer (stuffed mushrooms), to the main course (salmon) and dessert (tiramisu). 

This kind of place is what makes the valley so special.

Restaurants,"When I hit a quarter of a century in years, I decided to go the uncharacteristically classy route and celebrate with something chi chi and razzdango. Exchange the morning after whiskey dents and zombie flavored scratch 'n sniff composure for a posh dinner out on the town.

Now I'm gonna share a secret with y'all. I'm no gourmand. I like a fancy pants meal as much as the next, but I'm in the cheap mo fo demographic, so I don't know dick about fine dining in the Phoenix area. I rely on you Yelpers to guide me down the path of good taste when it comes to nice shit and stuff.

Cha, cha, cha.

MEDIZONA.

It even sounds fancy, and I'm convinced it should be said with jazz fingers and maybe some light orchestral flare.

An upscale, Mediterranean-Southwestern fusion restaurant?

Intriguing.

Rabbit and fig baklava atop a pomegranate balsamic reduction, topped with a quail egg and surrounded by crispity parsnip curls?

Wicked fricken good.

It puts fig newtons everywhere to shame. Layers of airy, buttery phyllo filled with tender shredded fig and rabbit would have been much too sweet solo, but the addition of a tart reduction grabbed that figgy sweetness and tangoed round my palate! Although I'm convinced that the quail egg was just intended to be a cute little hat for the baklava. Whatevs. At least now I can claim that psh, yeah I've had quail egg before, no biggie.

Wild caught halibut with chorizo potato cake, haricot verts and carrots with orange caper cream sauce?

Melt in my mouth delicious.

Try to sneak a nibble of chorizo potato cake from my plate and I will fork you. Hard. You might pull back something a little stumpy. That was the most delectable little nibblet on the plate. The fish was super flaky and buttery, although the sauce was forgettable. And I think it's pretentious and hoity toity to call green beans ""haricot verts."" Merde!

Roast loin of lamb, moussaka tart, mashed taters, celery root, mint oil, and roasted red pepper sauce?

Eh. 

The lamb was ordered medium rare and prepared to perfection. Mint oil should be mandatory garnish for all baby lambs. Make em prance around the field wearing mint garlands until they're led to slaughter, where said garland will be compressed into the requisite drizzle of mint oil. Or something like that. Everything else on the plate was served cold though. Blech.

The service was impeccable, the patrons gripe worthy. Our waiter was well informed and personable, although he disappeared half way through the meal, was replaced and we never saw him again, which was kinda weird. 

The customers he was serving were pretty inconsiderate. There was a huge party of people with kids rip roaring around the restaurant off in the side room. The waiter apologized on their behalf, stating that it was an abnormal night and that kids didn't normally frequent the place, and at least they left soon after that. I don't go out to listen to the rip roar of impatient ankle biters. Instant plus two for the atmosphere as soon as they left.

But then a large group of older patrons came in and bitched about how they couldn't read the menus because it was too dark, so they turned up the lights, bent the atmosphere over the side of a chair and fucked it hard.

So I think I'm going to be a downer on the super streak Medizona's having and only give it a four. It's good but I don't think I'd ever go back. Too many other fancy schmancy restaurants waiting in the wings for an opportunity to knock my socks off. No need to return.",4
Restaurants,"Medizona
My girlfriend and I were out for the afternoon in Scottsdale and had stopped in to SkyBox, at the Mondirain, for a cocktail when Yelp pointed out Medizona as a good dinner option. It was just a few blocks up so we heel-toe expressed it over to our destination, enjoying the pre-nightclub streets of the Dale and a spectacular show of color from the Arizona sunset. The sky oozed romance with reds and yellows flowing overhead guiding us to what was building to be a nice romantic evening out.

Medizona is located inbetween Old Town and Fashion Square Mall on the East side of Scottsdale Road. It is slightly buried in an older office area and the building itself seems to be a pastiche of what used to be multiple office suites repurposed for the culinary experience. The setting is subdued with low lighting and minimal decoration. There is a large room to the right that seems to be more for nightclub action, though we were there too early to see any such action.

We were waited on by a very comforting and professional gentleman who had the air of being the owner or manager. We choose a couple of glasses of Shiraz from Annies Barn and it was suggested we go with the sampler starter which consisted of a Rabbit Fig Baklava, Lamb in and Eggplant Taco, and Grilled Shrimp with Risotto. The Lamb and the Shrimp were tasty though not quite spectacular. I have a feeling that sampling them all together diluted the experience. I would recommend going 2 times and trying them seperatly. I say 2 times because the Rabbit Fig Baklava is not worth its own trip. The sweetness of the Fig here is out of place and conjours the flavor of a Grape Tootsie Roll Pop, which is not a good flavor for a rabbit dish.

For the entrees I chose the Lamb as I am always curious to see another take on a classic dish and my girlfriend went with the Salmon which we were told was going to be a featured dish in the upcoming issue of Gourmet Magazine. Both dishes were very good and I would recommend either to anyone anytime.

My overall take on Medizona is that its a very nice restaurant with a different take on things - crossing Mediteranian with Southwestern dishes - and I would recommend it for both romantic and small group dinners. The themes create a unique and memoriable experience without being too overdone or cliche.",4
Restaurants,"I took my wife there a couple of nights ago for her birthday.  It is a cool little place that is very lackluster from the outside looking in.  Heck, it is pretty lackluster on the inside as well.  Unfortunately we were the only people there.  We sat at the bar and had an appetizer and a glass of wine.  Other restaurants a chip shot away were bustling so I don't know what the deal is with this place.   Our scallop appetizer was delicious, the hummus and bread they brought out was delicious, and the wine was delicious.  The price wasn't too bad, the service was fine, but I think the ambience is killing this place.  Good luck Medizona.",4
Restaurants,"Hugely Disappointing!!  Based on all the other reviews maybe they were have an off night?  We already decided not to give it a 2nd try.....

We were seated and given menus but waited a good 10 minutes for them to come back for drink orders.  Then we waited a good 15 minutes for our dirty Kettle One martini's to come and waiting to order.  While we were waiting as patiently as we could the waiter takes the full order (drinks, apps, meal) of the couple who were seated 15 minutes after we arrived! Of course I would be understanding on the wait if the place was packed but there were only 5 tables filled in the entire place!!

We finally ordered and the watier came back 3 different times to clarify what we ordered.

The complimentary bread finally arrived along with our drinks, which by the way were terrible and in filthy (spotty, lipstick stained, crusty).  The bread was really great though so I started to have hope.

From the App's the Scallop and Goat cheese was great- the duck and mushroom was bland.

Main meal of pork chops and sea bass were boring. 

Oh when we got the bill they only did Well Martini's- would that have explained the poor taste or do they just not know how to make?

Bottom Line Summary:

Service Slow
Waiter Confused
Martini Horrible
Dirty Dirty Glasses
Food sounds GREAT but tastes quite bland.

Very Disappointing.",1
Restaurants,"Yelp has failed me...I went here based on the reviews I found on here, only to find a restaurant that has fallen off from what it used to be. 

I guess this use to be a chef driven restaurant, he created a name for the place. But whatever it is now it has definitely fallen off and definitely not good. 

The space is nice enough, I really did not enjoy sitting at the bar and have to look at there dirty kitchen the whole time...But the place does offer a pleasant enough atmosphere. 

The food on the other hand was bad. I had the tasting of the appetizers in which everything was overcooked (mushy eggplant) or overcooked and Burnt (anything that had bread like potential) I kinda of wanted to leave after this but I had ordered my Salmon entree from the start... 

And now on to the entree which consisted of overcooked salmon, burnt spices on the top, and RAW skin underneath, did not make any since to me. it came with a brick of polenta edible only by the pool of sauce on the plate. 

The menu and idea of this restaurant is great, sharp contrasts and bold flavor, but the technique and care is definitely lack here, or maybe they just had a shitty cook that day, I don't know, I just know that I will never make my way back there.",2
Restaurants,"This is a younger crowd (20-30's) for the most part, with emphasis on the twenty-somethings.  The food is very good, and the service was great.  Have been there for lunch and in the evening.  It can get pretty packed at night.",4
Restaurants,Nothing beats going to a bar when you can sit outside comfortably in the middle of December!,4
Restaurants,"There is great live music here and it's a good setup. There is a bar/dancefloor area, a chill lounge room, and it opens up to a wide open area with tables and another DJ and floor outside. 

The crowd can be touch and go here, but more often than not, I find I have a good time gettin' down at Sugar D's.",4
Restaurants,"Sugar Daddy's is a great place to spend a Sunday when you need to soak up the alchol from the previous night . The 5,000-square-foot patio bar, which is a popular daytime drinking destination, boasts an all-you-can-eat brunch for around $9 on Sundays with live music on the patio. I had the most amazing french toast here a couple months ago.

For those wanting a little hair of the dog, there's also a make-your-own-Bloody-Mary bar ($4) from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.",3
Restaurants,"Sugar Daddy's is one of those situations where you have a recipe for awesome that is completely squandered. This place just oozes atmosphere and cool. Unfortunately, it's just not cool. I don't know if it's the patrons or the staff, but there's something about this place that just sucks. Could it be the name? Is it just too 1990s? 

It does feel a bit off somehow, yet you can't help but wander around the various rooms and notice some of the great things this joint has going for it. So why does it suck then?

They've recently moved the pool tables outside and have gotten rid of the wooden bench style outdoor seating in favor of granite countertops they probably salvaged from a Paradise Valley remodel (well, most likely not salvaged - but that's too bad since the ugly-ass granite tables look like shit yet likely cost a pretty penny). I miss the old set-up - while it wasn't quite working, it was better than this. They also aren't using the awesome back parlor anymore apparently... 

For a Friday night, the place was practically empty. I don't think it's the location - sure, it's not walking distance from the rest of the downtown scene, but it's near enough. I've never been impressed with the service here at all either - they're often assholes unless you're getting food and sitting down - then they're just fine. The food is greasy and disgusting to be honest, but I've had worse. They do have a few items that are pretty tasty (but still greasy). 

It could be an awesome venue for music, but they have the oddest acts ever. They just haven't found a good niche I guess. Oddly enough, it's a good place to go for a quiet night. That's probably not a good thing for a place with so much real estate - this place should be buzzing at all times. People are content to slum it up at Loco Patron where the atmosphere screams Taco Bell and the crowd screams $300 Jean Cockers I guess.

If any place needs to be reinvented, this is it - both in name and in style. They wouldn't have to change too much. There's always at least a handful of people here and you could always use this place to meet someone on a blind date or whatever... aside from that though, this place serves no real purpose other than just being there. If you drive by and the patio looks full, check it out sometime... you won't have a bad time here, I just can't promise it'll be good.",3
Restaurants,"This place seems to be on its last leg.  I heard they were going to revamp it within the year but I don't know what they can do to change the image.  Its a nice place but people just don't go there.  Even when its packed it doesn't boast the fun loving atmosphere it has the potential to.  Its tough to describe..........

Outside patio is nice.",2
Restaurants,"Nothing here to get excited about. Not sure if the place has changed hands recently, but I remember a lot of people telling me this was a hot spot a few years ago.

Anyway, headed over on a Friday night about a year ago and the scene was pathetic. It had a low life gangster vibe to it, and it just felt dirty overall. The crowd was mostly punks.

The service was atrocious.",2
Restaurants,"If this place doesn't serve as a case study of what ""wasted opportunity"" and ""terrible management"" looks like, then show me another place like Sugar Daddy's that frighteningly resembles Chernobyl 1986.

I chuckle now because several times, years ago, I would wait in a line to get into this place -- not on my own accord, mind you -- but because some of my buddies thought this place was the killer.  In fact, this place would be freaking AWESOME if it was plopped down on 3rd Street and Roosevelt.  But it had two major things working against it: 1) Their kickarse patio faces the lame part of Scottsdale Road, and 2) Their kickarse property is in the lame part of Scottsdale Road.

Granted, I still wouldn't go if this place was set in Old Town, but at least they wouldn't be gasping for air while the distant, populated beach of Goldwater shrugs a casual shoulder.

This place just takes 'whats wrong with the Scottsdale bar scene' to another level.  They actually started this genus of bars and moved it further along the street to Loco Patron, which, conveniently enough for those vertical-striped sharks without a tank, is the slightly less crippled version of Sugar Daddy's.",1
Restaurants,"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!! I wish I had found this website BEFORE wasting our time and money on this dive!!! I can't believe they have the nerve to charge $10 to get into this pathetic dump... and the worse part is... we paid it!!

This place used to be a cool place to go in south Scottsdale that wasn't THAT far for us that live in the east valley.

Tax problems, and then stabbing, after stabbing, after stabbing. WTF!?!?!?! 
You would think after the first stabbing they would have clean it up but it seems they haven't. Which sucks cuz the place can be really cool place to go and hang outside and party. 
I guess if you ever want to go to Sugar Daddy's it better be during the day light hours and make sure you have on your full body armour.

now, it's like driving by a cemetery. after the tax deal, then all the fights that happen there, you couldn't pay me to go to that place. ghost town would be how i'd describe it. so, i will. it's a ghost town.

total waste of a great place. put a fork in it.",1
Restaurants,"I guess this place used to be cool to hang out, but something changed. A friend who was a former ARZ resident took us here on a Saturday night and for the most part, it wasn't that bad. It's a huge place and with a great outdoor patio and bar. Best part, $1 beers from 10pm- Midnight! We stayed here for awhile until the demographics drastically changed to a point where we felt.. hmmm.. maybe we should go. They had a group put a ""VIP"" banner in the patio for ""pictures""... we all thought this was very strange, but you can't beat $1 beers!",3
Restaurants,"This is not your typical mall food.  Tomatoes features delicious sandwiches, salads, pastas and burgers.  Their fries are some of the best I have ever had.  I have not tried their desserts but they always look great.  They have different salads everyday that are fresh and delicious.",4
Restaurants,That place had great food especially great burgers! Too bad it closed! Not sure if they were going to to re-open some where else???,5
Public Services & Government,One star for doing your best to make the parking situation at Camelback Mountain as aggravating as possible.  One star for pandering to your idiot residents that didn't realize that they live in the middle of a giant metropolis which means there might be traffic. If they wanted peace and quiet they should have moved to Montana. One star for paying your police officers to drive around all day long looking for hikers that park in front of someone's house.,1
Public Services & Government,"One of my favorite towns in the Valley.  We have a few friends who live here and frequently visit the resorts and restaurants.

Things I like:
+ Camelback Mountain
+ All homes must be on an acre or more of land.
+ High standard of living required for all residents.
+ Residents stand by their convictions and don't waver.
+ Awesome resorts and restaurants.  The Sanctuary Resort and El Chorro Lodge are 2 of my favs in PV.

Things I don't like:
- 40 mph speed limit on major streets cutting through.
- Traffic cameras are everywhere, boo!
- Very few street lights.  It's extremely dark driving around Paradise Valley.  You could miss a street or destination if you're unfamiliar with the area.
- All of the hikers who invade the town to hike Camelback and ignore the local laws and rules.  Then act disrespectful when they are cited.

Overall, I'd love to live here someday.

No?

Do you like wicker chairs?
No?

Do you like fake ivy?
No?

Then you really shouldn't go to the Quilted Bear. It smells like old people. Honestly, I can't even remember what I got. Maybe a chicken salad sandwich. 
I was so overwhelmed by the 70+ average age, the wicker chairs and fake dusty ivy everywhere that I couldn't hardly stand it.",2
Restaurants,"It's really not as bad as the other reviewer stated. Granted there is a certain Geritol feel to it, but 70 in fact is not that old. Specially when you're fast approaching 50. 

There are a lot more exciting places to eat within a few blocks, but I'm old, and I like restaurants that serve good tasting food. Not foo-foo food. You know, Gorgonzola Cheese Quesadillas with Tuna Tartar. Give me a burger or a Pastrami Sandwich (with only pickles and mustard) any day of the week over the foo-foo crap. 

And Quilted Bear does. 

Good soups, good sandwiches, and a decent salad bar. A nice quiet place to have a nice lunch.",4
Restaurants,"UPDATE: 08/26/2009 - It is now being reported that this restaurant has officially closed, permanently. 

This used to be a great place fore breakfast or lunch in Scottsdale. They had a manager (Robert) who was omnipresent, looking after everything. When they let him go, the place started to rot - literally. The carpets were worn and dirty, the chairs were grimy and then the County Health Department began writing them up for repeat critical violations like leaving cooked sausage out overnight in food prep areas (be my guest and look it up). Food quality began to suffer as recipes and ingredients were changed. Cheese sauce which used to be made there was coming out of a can. Portions shrank as prices increased. The crowd dwindled. 

On my most recent visit, the restaurant was closed with a sign by the door saying ""Closed for the summer"". This place has never closed in the summer. I think it may simply be gone now, never to reopen and that's probably a good idea. With all of the health dept. write-ups for broken and cracked seals on things, refrigerators not working, dangerous food handling techniques, it seems the owners have been riding it out and not it's just over. Probably a good thing.",1
Restaurants,"Bears living in the zoo eat fresher and higher quality food than this. 

I was saddened at how horrific this geriatric hot spot was, and I'm definitely not surprised that this place is now closed. 

Unfortunately I made the decision to try this place out. I have no idea why. 

My friend ordered a sandwich. That's pretty much all there is to say about it. He ordered a sandwich, ate it, and he immediately regretted it. 

I made the poor choice to select the unimpressive and soggy chicken alfredo pasta. It looked as though it had come from a can, a freshly opened can nonetheless, hence the one star. I couldn't eat it without the gag reflex setting in. 

The interior made me feel strange and awkward with wooden bear figurines, bad seating, fake foliage, doily tablecloths and hanging needlepoint pictures.

Well Quilted Bear, if anything, you left a strong impression in my mind as well as some comic relief every now and then when I drive by your outdated sign--still wondering what heck possessed me to walk though those disgusting doors. RIP, Quilted Bear.",1
Restaurants,"The name of this restaurant is a little deceiving... although they do have Thai food, it is not traditional Thai food and they do serve other Asian food as well. They are very upfront about this, i.e. the waiter explained it all before I ordered... but I didn't know until after I had sat down.

When going to Thai restaurants for the first time, I usually use pad thai as my yardstick to measure quality. Although the pad thai was quite good, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. The regular pad thai seemed to be cooked in a curry sauce, and I could have used it a little spicier... which is my own fault, as I didn't realize that I hadn't been asked how spicy I wanted my dish until it was sitting in front of me (another thing I thought odd for a Thai place).

I would go back... but I'm going to to do it  when I'm in the mood for ""Asian"" food as opposed to ""Thai."" There were definitely other things on the menu that seemed enticing.

As to the decorum, service and price, Thaifoon definitely has the ""upscale"" feel one would expect for the neighborhood in which it is located. The one thing I feel is worth noting is the waterfall behind the bar that is, for lack of better adjectives, ""really cool.""

EDIT: In retrospect, no surprise this place went the way of the dodo.",3
Restaurants,"this place had an issue w/ holding a reservation.  my buddy made a reservation and each time he called to confirm it, they said it they never heard of our party.  that's shady.  anyways, when we finally got there, there was a reservation but we really didn't need it as it was really empty and it was a friday night.  we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service.  

we sat on down and ordered our food.  the meaties had the orange peel chicken, red curry chicken and honey walnut shrimp.  the veggies had pad thai and i'm not sure since i didn't really have anything from those selections.  the red curry was good, orange peel was decent and the walnuts in the honey walnut were over caramelized and got stuck in my teeth.

we got a crappy sake recommendation that literally tasted like bitter water.  yuck!  we did get some dessert but that wasn't decent at best.  one was a rich chocolate cake and the other was a ""heavenly"" white cake.  sounds good in theory but just alright.

the place felt like it was trying to be a PF Chang's but doesn't come close.  the weird thing is that the place tries to push thai food as its specialty but it's really not and has a lot of chinese plates.  so a confused restaurant w/ a schizo menu.  find some place else to eat...",2
Restaurants,"THAIFOON IS CLOSED!

I heard rumors, but I drove by tonight just to see for myself.  Sure enough, sign is down and space is completely empty.  Do you think it was because of the 2 star yelp reviews?

On the other hand, DISH is open!  Review on that coming soon :)",1
Restaurants,"I don't do fast food, but I do Del Taco.  The only thing I ever order is the 1/2 pound bean and cheese burrito, and I'm convinced its the best edible 99 cents out there.  Why?  They use lard-free refried beans.  And that means everything.  

I've had bean burritos everywhere, and Del Taco's is the one of the few that doesn't give me stomach discomfort and I'm positive its because of the omission of the lard.  The tortilla quality is decent, too.

You have the option of Red or Green sauce, too... Get the red.

As for the restaurant itself, I'm also happy with the friendliness of the staff as well as the cleanliness of the establishment.  And with the money you save, you can go to RA for happy hour the next day!",3
Restaurants,"I'm generally a fan of Del Taco, but this review is for one thing....

It's 2010, why doesn't Del Taco have established debit/credit card machines in their restaurants? I know they cost quite a bit to run, but for a prominent fast food restaurant, one would think you could invest in it. I think it's funny whenever I go through the drive-thru, they have to grab the little machine and hold it out so I can put my pin in...or...as it was a few months ago, they'd have a little notepad for me to sign off my receipt...Ha!

That's still better than the local by Six Flags in Cali where I had to use the atm in the store that translated to the register and gave me cash with a stupid fee. 

dumb.",3
Arts & Entertainment,Fantastic service and the staff are so friendly!,5
Arts & Entertainment,Been here twice to redeem some higher paying winning tickets... nothing crazy. Always fast and easy in and out. You can go inside and buy tickets over the counter or in the machine they also have... Cool.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"I've been playing the lottery for year's! Started playing the same #'s on Powerball, Pick, Fantasy 5, and Mega Millions for the last 14yrs. Never hit more than $500 which was on Fantasy 5 about 2yrs ago. I have to say....feeling frustrated with the lottery anymore! The constant increasing numbers on games just shoots the s**ts of ever foreseeing winning it! Taking away games that you felt like having a chance of getting something decent for example Weekly Winning, best game I think they ever came out with,  to replace it with 5 Card Draw where you can instantly win as lottey retailers print the ticket. Yeah...like their going to give you that ticket!! I have had them literally put it aside to print me another and keep the one they first printed for themselves....Huh??? Stupidest idea EVER Az Lottery!!!! I think it may be time to retire the lottery to invest the $100 plus $$$ into investments to ACTUALLY retire!",3
Restaurants,"ZERO stars! Long wongs are independently owned, but if it was my name I would most definetly pull it from this place. I ordered via phone, and as soon as I walked in I wish I hadn't. This place is dirty, it smells like incense and it overall gives me the creeps. I paid for my order and ate one wing at home. It had almost no meat on it, it was though, and the sauce was nasty. Overall stay away!",1
Restaurants,"Everytime I come here I feel so welcomed that I end up staying way longer than I had planned. I've been coming to this Mom and Pop shop for a while and appreciate greasy wings and piping hot pie as much as the next salivating patron, but what keeps me coming back is the service with a smile!!",5
Restaurants,"Awful, very disappointed

Wings were bland with little to no sauce. Sauce was not hot or very good.

They charge $1.50 to use a Debit Card

Just don't bother going!",1
Restaurants,"Very bland wings.  Ordered 24 hot wings.  Forced to pay 1.50 to use a debit card.  

Wings were done in 5 mins.  I should have figured that they would be horrible 

No sauce on the wings and they tasted like they were fried in dirty old oil


Skip this long wongs and hit up the one on central and baseline 

Zero stars if possible",1
Restaurants,Great wings but hardly go anymore due to the rising prices:(,3
Restaurants,"Cleaner than most Long Wong's I've been to, but with some of the most brusque staff ever. Even the menu reads something like ""This is NOT fast food. Be patient!"" as if anyone would like to wait 20-30 minutes for items that aren't that tough to whip up. In any case, I love the wings...I don't think they're the best, but they're really close. The burgers are alright too, especially that California burger loaded with guacamole. At only $3.69, it's totally worth it.

For a sports bar, this place has some weird hours for a sports bar and grill. They're never really open too late. What a bummer--they'd get more business from me that way.",3
Restaurants,"I wish we had the option to give no stars. I normally don't waste my time on bad posts or negative reviews but, I feel this is something I should share. Today I took my dog into the dog groomers next door. I do not live in the area so I tried to kill time around the area. I came back to the area and I still had twenty minutes to kill... There's nothing in the plaza to sit down and relax at SO I found Long Wongs. It was about 4pm so I didn;t want a filling meal because, I had to cook dinner for my family... I had my two year old with me so, I asked for a kids meal.. The lady I believe they call mama looked at me and said that's it? I smiled and said yes. She got very rude with me and said you need to spend 4 more dollars for me to take your card. I said fine can I get a slice of pizza? She said Okay you don't want a drink? I said no I had a tea in the car. She sighed at me and took my card. She said is this to go? I said No, I will be eating here. She said I don't let people eat here unless they spend 10.00. I said are you kidding? She said no but, since we aren't busy I will let you sit down. I HAD A TWO YEAR OLD WITH ME IN 120 heat mind you! Wow! So... I was a little irritated needless to say but, it was better than waiting in the car in the beginning of July... When our food came out... i was appalled! My two slices of pizza looked like Dignornio.... My daughters corn dog was BLACK... and her fries... Were DISGUSTING so DISGUSTING... They were tasteless. We took a few bites threw it away and walked out. I will never ever ever go back to this place. You never know who is going to walk through your door as a business and your impression lasts... I own a store in the area... When they asked for a good quick bite to eat... it will not be long wongs.... I can't believe how we were treated and served. Sad!",1
Restaurants,"This is such an unusual place.
The staff friendly and accommodating,   I've been to many places that serve chicken wings but would have to say honestly these wings were the best. Cooked to  perfection in a tangy sauce. When asked Mama(Who is the owner /manager)about the sauce, and ingredients Her response was it's a secrets but said that's what makes them the best.
I would have to agree.",5
Restaurants,"Nice friendly service.  Its a family owned business and the people seem rough and rude but once you get to know them you realize it's just their strong personality.  They have the best wings in town and my whole family have been coming here for the past 16 years.  I have tried other places but nothing beats the wings here, not even buffalo wild wings which to my opinion not so good.  Family from out of state either come here to eat when in town or ask me to take them some when I go visit.",5
Restaurants,"I must say after my experience at this particular Long Wongs is that not all Long Wongs are created equal.  It wasn't bad. No, not at all. In fact, if I were to judge the food part of the experience against other popular chicken wing food experiences (i.e.: buffalo wild wings or native new yorker) (I don't think that I used the I.E. and parenthesis correctly there) but the overall experience was sub-par.  I felt uncomfortable in the dining area and there was a strange smell.  I will say that the service was amazing and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.  If you are in the area and have 45 minutes to spare (in good traffic) (again not sure if i'm using the parenthesis correctly there) just drive to the mesa location which is... well it is better.",2
Restaurants,"Really scrumptious crispy wings, but the pizza is definitely FROZEN pizza. only one size offered and no crust to it. Will come back for wings but nothing else. Nice staff.",3
Restaurants,Best spot in town for wings the staff is amazing and the seating isn't bad they have pool inside which makes the wait for food better or even after a good meal nothing better than some pool vs a friend! The wings are outstanding! The location is random but nice! I will be coming back I love it!,5
Restaurants,Finally some good hot wings!,5
Restaurants,"Who ever answered the phone here is RUDE , 0 customer service couldn't even place a order before the guy hung up on me dude should be fired !",1
Restaurants,"The food is fine. The only thing I would recommend never ordering is anything with 'cabeza' in it. I love cabeza, but theirs is salty as hell. Completely inedible.

Also, every time I go there things seem to  have a different price(and I'm not talking about the menu prices, I'm talking about the amount charged). The owner should probably watch his employees closely.",3
Restaurants,"Oh my goodness, this was very delicious. It's small, there's a little bit of seating and it reminds you of a taco stand. The food comes in massive servings of very deliciousness. I've never heard of super fries, who thinks of retried beans on carne Asada fries?? The burrito had to be 12 inches. I couldn't finish it. Even my baby loved it!",5
Restaurants,"Very tasty and fresh. Staff is friendly, and really knows the menu. Nice burnt chili taco sauce. Very authentic.",4
Restaurants,"Great joint.  Nice, clean and, what else can you say, it is DAIRY QUEEN!",4
Restaurants,"I agree with Roland and Karl, hey it's Dairy Queen! What can you say about it? We were in the area and wanted a little sweet treat after dinner. I can't remember the last time I've been to a DQ. Maybe 6 years ago? I love that they have a mini blizzard size. I got the mint oreo and my husband got the pumpkin pie. Yum!",4
Restaurants,"like my wife said (and the only other 2 reviewers), Hey, it's Dairy Queen. so tasty and refreshing when it's 100 degrees out. thing about dairy queen is they go to an area where there's no other fast food and they dominate! 

i had the pumpkin blizzard which was extremely delightful. since we had to wait longer than like 5 minutes, they comp'd us a medium instead of the mini we ordered. my gal got the mint oreo but i didn't try it because i was gluttonizing in my own frosty treat.",5
Restaurants,I love a good old DQ cone every once in a while. Sure they cost more than Mickey D's cones but no where as good. I went to this place couple days ago and the temp was 108F! When I saw the DQ down the hill I just had to stop and grab a dip cone. My daughter and I first had to make a potty break. The bathrooms were clean but just showed age of wearing. We went to the counter and ordered our cones. The cones were perfect! The manager misunderstood my daughter's order but without any issue quickly gave her a new cone. The manager was very friendly and nice. I am glad I stopped here because reminded me of playing baseball as a kid and went to DQ after the game.,5
Restaurants,"This restaurant is simply amazing. It's the only fast food restaurant in Cave Creek, and boy do they know how to run it! 
The food is, well, DQ, so you can't go wrong there. Also, the restaurant is kept constantly clean- cleaner than any average fast food place, because the night closers work so hard to make it look good. The people who work there are generally extremely nice and polite, and will treat you like a real person and not just another random customer. 
My only gripe is that they don't have Cherry Dip. Get on that, DQ! There's simply no replacement for it! 
I highly suggest this place for any ice-cream or food. It's family friendly, fun, clean, and delicious.",4
Restaurants,Owner was very rude and mean when I asked if they can make ice cream sodas.  Customer service was very poor.  Will not stop at this dairy queen again.,1
Restaurants,"I was excited to find a Dairy Queen close to home. But, that was short lived. I ordered a blizzard and it was below the rim and very short on additives. When I asked about it, i was told ""it's within Dairy Queen guidelines"". I'm not a Dairy Queen expert, but this was sub-par to the other Dairy Queens I've visited. :(",1
Restaurants,Very rude people except 1 girl that was new. Hope the other attitudes don't role off on her!  Any way sorry that I asked for the rest of my order!  The look and attitude was ridiculous.  Also the boy that took my order was rolling his eyes like I was waisting his time.  Sorry. What happened to customer service.  I work in the customer service industry and I would make some changes up front.  Food was good for Dairy Queen tho!,2
Restaurants,"Dairy Queen and their blizzards are obviously amazing, but this review is going to go much deeper than this. This review is going to talk about their blizzard ice cream cakes. Yes you read that right. Blizzard ice cream cakes! For my husband's recent birthday, I opted for his annual ice cream birthday cake but this year, we live in a different area which means the Baskin Robbins ice cream cake wasn't going to cut it. I had heard about the Dairy Queen ice cream cakes, so I decided to give it a try. Blizzard cakes take 48 hours prep time because they are made to order, but I promise you it is worth the weight! I ordered the peanut butter cup blizzard cake. The verdict? My husband was thrilled and so was I! The cake was the perfect combination of ice cream, blizzard mixture, peanut butter cups and fudge cake. If you need a cake for a special occasion, remember that Dairy Queen offers much more than just drive through frozen treats. They also sell delicious cakes!",5
Restaurants,Not sure why they are so mad here. Got a blizzard and when they gave to me they had a look of death when the handed it to me. Could act like you want to me here.,1
Restaurants,"Not good!  Walked in around 930 pm and the place was a hot mess. From the floors to the bathroom to the dirty and unkept area behind the counter, I should have taken the clue. My blizzard came and it looked runny. It even tasted strange and rotten. Within an hour I was pretty sick. Never had a bad ice cream experience before this one. Really disappointing",1
Restaurants,Times must be tough. Ordered a Butterfinger and it hardly had any Butterfinger. Won't go back. Went back and they did fix the problem. But hey. Get it right the first time.,1
Restaurants,"The Gyros are pretty standard fair with a healthy portion of meat with fresh onions, tomato and a tzatziki sauce that hits the right notes.
Lots of tables but it can feel a bit cramped but the atmosphere comfortable and friendly, they don't have fountain drinks, but a ""grab it yourself"" fridge with a decent selection of canned soda, which just seems a little odd to me, but if your there for the Gyro you won't be disappointed!",4
Restaurants,"It had been over a year since I last visited this restaurant. I should have waited even longer. The place was empty which should have been an indication of how the food has changed - not for the better. 2 of us ordered the Gyros salad. How hard can that be to make? Gyro meat, lettuce, onions, 1 tomato slice and sauce. Unfortunately for us, apparently it was hard to do.  Because they seem to do little business, the lettuce was turning brown on some pieces. And the gyros meat had been on the spit a little too long. Pieces of it were crisp and hard to chew.  The meat really had no taste to it either. I won't be back. And from the looks of it, neither will many others.",1
Restaurants,"Romen's was not terrible but easily the worst kebab/gyro that I have ever paid for.  

My order took some time so I was expecting a delicious meal as I've found that great food often comes with a longer wait.  Instead I was treated to a small portion of bland meat, skimpy toppings and light on the sauce.  

I've paid less for more food and have had better kebab/gyro sandwiches at many places.  

It's a haul for anyone up in the Sun City/Surprise area but if you want a great Middle Eastern/Mediterrainian sandwich (or food in general) take a trip across Apache Blvd in Tempe and stop at one of the 5 or 6 places between Mill and McClintock.  They will not disappoint.",2
Restaurants,"I have never ordered a chicken gyro and received something so disgusting. The ""chicken"" was a flattened hunk of mystery meat. It looked like a couple slices of thick turkey lunch meat packed with fillers. 

There was no way it was going in my mouth. 

I pulled it out and then tried to eat the--now veggie--gyro. It was still awful. The tzatziki sauce was so bland it could have been water. The pita itself was nothing special. And the water from the soda fountain dispenser tasted worse than tap.",1
Restaurants,"Food is a little bland , not much variety , go there for the coffee if your forced to kill some time.",2
Restaurants,"I'm giving the 3 stars solely for 1 reason: 
The veggie sandwich! 

There's normally only 1 person waitressing/taking orders, so expect a slow turn around during breakfast & lunch time. To avoid the crowds I'd pick up a flier in the morning, call around 10 am & pre-order for pick up. If I had no time to wait to check out I would simply ask for delivery. A girls gotta eat! :)",3
Restaurants,"Great lunch place with delicious fresh sandwiches, soups and salads and an excellent wait staff.",5
Restaurants,"Sweet potato pancakes, had to give them a try! They tasted very much like pumpkin pancakes, probably because of the spices. Still, they were good & really moist! The size is also nice, very normal, anyone could easily eat 3. In other places it seems like the pancakes are competing with the size of a human head, lol! 

The coffee was really mild. I never thought I'd say this, but it needs to be a little stronger. 

Call ahead with your order if you can. This place is a bit of a hang out & during 'peak' breakfast and lunch hours it gets busy.",3
Restaurants,"One cannot go wrong with a sweet treat on a hot Valley of the Sun fall day!  This DQ has solid offerings, is clean, and they are pretty quick with the orders.  My issue is with the extremely angry, moody, rude older Hispanic woman that works the counter regularly on Monday afternoons... She just oozes hatred... Hatred for her job, hatred for the customer, and hatred for everything in life... And that's why I can't and won't give this place anything more than two stars; because every time I head to the freezer for one of my tasty DQ treats the bitter, angry woman appears in my head!",2
Restaurants,"Regular quality you would expect from DQ, clean, and the staff has always been friendly.  However the downside here is in the speed of service.  They always seem to have plenty of staff.  In fact at times if almost go so far as to say they are tripping over each other. The problem exists both inside and at the drive thru window.",3
Restaurants,"When we decided to live in Sun City West, we set our priorities up and being close to a good Dairy Queen was right near the top!  This place is just fine.  In the winter it can get pretty busy but they usually have enough staff.  If you like Blizzards and good shakes, you won't be disappointed.  Beats the pants off the lousy, overpriced Arbys down the street.
Gary",4
Restaurants,"I am really disappointed with Dairy Queen after our recent visit.   I was really looking forward to a dipped butterscotch cone & was told this location doesn't have butterscotch.   So I settled with some hot Apple pie & ice cream thing.   The amount of ice cream was minimal,  lots of ""crust"", very very little apple in this whole dessert then it was all covered in a very sickening sweet carmel.  It probably wouldn't have been to bad if I could've had more apples or ice cream in there and alot less carmel.   Not sure if I'll ever visit again!",1
Restaurants,"What can I say, I'm a sucker for their $5 lunch deals.  I always order the chicken strips with gravy and a hot fudge sundae.",5
Restaurants,"My grandparents always go here when I visit. It's a small family owned business, nothing to write home about. I've never been there for breakfast, but their lunch/dinner entrees are typical family owned diner fare. Their sloppy joes are above average if you're into that sort of thing, and I had a pretty good bacon cheeseburger (the patty was cooked well-done as I had ordered, and the bacon was thick). The one thing about this place is the repertoire they seem to have built with their customers.  They know my grandpa, and always seem to know many of their other customers when I'm there.  This is in a retirement community, and I always feel so young in there :)",3
Restaurants,Not edible.,1
Restaurants,"Friday AYCE Fish Fry was good.  U have a choice of baked or fried cod, soup or salad, & fries or baked/mashed potato's.  All was very good!",4
Restaurants,"The food here is fair. The staff seems pretty snarky. Our waitress accidentally spilled food on us, which is okay... I mean, accidents happen. The thing that I found to be upsetting is the manager didn't even offer to discount my meal or anything, which I had plenty of time to stew over as I sat in ranch dressing stained pants for the rest of the day at work. The waitress offered to pay for my lunch, but I didn't feel that that was necessary... I feel like management should take care of these things, not the waitress. I did appreciate her offer though, which is why they get two stars over one.",2
Restaurants,"We were in town visiting relatives & came here with my husband's grandmother for breakfast.  (It's a regular haunt for her & her friends.). In fact, they seem to have a lot of regulars who are greeted by name.  The food was nothing fancy, but it was decent & the service was good.  In particular, we were impressed with Diego.",3
Restaurants,Below average food quality. Meatloaf was a grilled patty drenched in gravy. Patty was burnt on one side. A real dive. It's not that hard to serve better quality food. Get it together.,1
Restaurants,Food was good buy overpriced. The lady behind the register was straight up ignorant and rude!,1
Restaurants,"Not impressed at all. The waitress kept interjecting herself into our conversations. The drinks were empty most of the time. The food was clearly not fresh made. Salad came from a bag. And who splits a hotdog lengthwise and serves it on a piece of bread for a kid's meal? Seriously? 

What's confusing about this place, and many places in SCW is that the people come here in droves. When you get old, do you somehow lose your tastebuds entirely or are you just willing to accept cheap crap because it's cheap? I just don't understand it. But I will say if my in-laws suggest it again, it will be met with a resounding NO.",1
Restaurants,Good breakfast. Very attentive service. Friendly. Happy to see you. We came there because another restaurant was too crowded. We decided this will be our new place to go.,4
Restaurants,"For the price, Carrie's Cafe provides a good meal.  If you are looking for top of the line, then Carrie's is not the right place.  But for some good home cooking, Carrie's is quite good.  The staff were attentive but not overbearing.",4
Restaurants,Local restaurant in Sun City West Arizona if you want a good home cooked type of meal recommend them very much. They have a variety of food on their menu along with fish fry Friday night and they're great special they have every night. Then coming here to Carrie's for over 20 + years.,5
Restaurants,The Food Is Not That Good Would Not Feed it the dog the service is real slow never going back,1
Restaurants,"They call it the Benedick McArnold for a reason 
What a Rip off and ""cheese sauce?""
Poor quality poor service plain and simple",1
Restaurants,I frequent this location often and have never been displeased. The drive thru is usually moving pretty steady and the self order kiosk in the lobby makes dining in a snap. The staff seem to be in a good mood and always smile and greet you.,5
Restaurants,"The mushroom burger my Dad ordered was pathetic and dry with no mushrooms at all.How can you advertise something you cannot bother to make correctly at your establishment
My son ordered seasoned curly fries and that was what broke the Camels back.Completely unacceptable food.Even the dog wouldn't eat the bits and pieces.Where were the curly fries for this order.There was nothing but hard ends and over greased fried pieces, There wasn't 1 CURLY fry there and they were cold as well,What happened to the days of caring about what you served. Jack can Jump Up My ***",1
Restaurants,"Wanted to order the jalapeño bacon burrito. Big picture on the drive-thru menu  but no price. So I ordered a breakfast Jack. When I asked the cashier about the price of the burrito, she took my money and said, ""thank you,"" in a very mechanic voice.",1
Restaurants,"So, I went through the drive thru last night and forgot to get my debit card back. Figured it out this morning after tearing my place apart.

Went back and was told to come back again when the manager who was there last night was in. Wasn't told when that was until a second visit inside the store today. Why can't they just tell me it is or isn't there before I call my bank and cancel it?",1
Local Flavor,Best building department in southern nv.  The others dont compare to the ease of getting a permit to do a job.  COH is proactive!,5
Local Flavor,"Nice area of Henderson, I usually come here for the Farmer's Markets during the weekdays. There are a number of local owned businesses, coffee shops, gas stations, and even a small hotel. If you're interested to see what Henderson's local owned businesses have to offer, stop in some of the shops to get a different perspective. The City of Henderson's building has a large court, which is where the Farmer's Market is set up on the weekdays. This area is close to many other businesses down the street.

For a major area of Henderson, the establishments are nice, welcoming, and frequently have plenty of people browsing.",4
Local Flavor,Don't get stabbed!,3
Local Flavor,slow slow slow slow slow slow service to just get a permit...which was waaaayyy expensive for no reason!,2
Local Flavor,"Watch out for city council meetings! They gave us the run around for 8 months on a re-zoning process, plus were incredibly condescending. Words cannot express my dismay at the double standard that Councilwoman Schroder presented--reprimanding one side of a communal dispute without acknowledging the other side's continual bullying and threats.",1
Local Flavor,"Super Duper Cute! Little Old Town Hendertucky cute as a bugs ear! Reminds me of Folsom Ca.. They have a farmers market on Thursday I think, cute businesses and a real home town feel.. Parking garage, nice touch.. I do like it here on Water street, I think that is the main drag, again small and cute!",4
Local Flavor,"One star is way too much to be giving these bullying thieves. Their public service department has a monopoly on the water in the town and they take full advantage of it, charging  ridiculous late fees plus a $20 fee to disconnect and another $20 to reconnect. Then they don't tell you exactly when they're going to cut your water off. You can be just 10 days late on your bill and BAM, off goes your water. I've been with this pathetic joke of a company for 24 years and have had my water turned of TWICE, in 24 years!!! That qualifies for these bastards to charge me an extra $150 deposit, after 24 years of me being their customer. The only reason I have to bend over and take their raping is because they have a monopoly on the water in Henderson and they're the ONLY ONES that supply the water. And they know it. What a total joke this company is!! I almost feel like moving out of this town just so I don't have to deal with these SOBs.",1
Local Flavor,"Man I just got off the phone with the water Nazi. I pay my bills online, manual check... dafuk? Nobody got time for that. Apparently even though the electronic check date was three day prior to the due date (as was the post date) my check arrived on the 30th.. not the 29th. So they charged a $9 late fee. Damn thats a drink at the Cosmo. Thats a delicious Port of Subs sandwich and chips. And a cookie. In this day and age of deadbeats who doesn't have a grace period? I mean damn it was a DAY late. Their attitude about it was also bitter and salty, much like the quality of the water they serve.",2
Local Flavor,"Best place in Henderson for passport applications and renewals. Don't even bother with the US post office, the city clerk's office is much faster with better customer service.",5
Local Flavor,"City of Henderson is a wonderful city to live since I have moved here I have had almost zero complaints about what they do or how they run the city.  However I have made one complaint to City Hall regarding the condition of my neighborhood area off of wigwam and Stephanie.  During the last 6 to 7 months there has been a major significant increase in people leaving their trash.  Every day I am finding broken beer bottle's and empty alcohol containers left all along the side of wigwam starting at Stephanie all the way to Gibson.  Just across the street of wigwam there is an empty field and right along the side of the road there are crack pipes and marijuana bongs left out there they weren't there a year ago or so.  Also there are graffiti on some of the utilities along the side of the road .  I have made complaints to property management and local businesses within that area and I've heard nothing back which is why I made the call to the city and still nothing has been fixed.  

This is a major concern because there is a different crowd of people that have moved over here and since that time the state of this community has diminished drastically.  There are lots of young kids here now and it's starting to become an unsafe area when you're seeing drug paraphernalia and alcohol containers literally sitting out in the street.  

The city needs to stop worrying about the Green Valley Ranch area and the seven Hills area in the Whitney Ranch area and the horizon ridge area that need to start focusing on this area.  Get some city officials out along the wigwam Road between Stephanie and Gibson and start holding these local establishments particularly winco, RC Wiley, chase and traverse point condos and colonial management accountable.

It makes it very difficult for homeowners who want to sell and it makes it very difficult for homeownership might want to rent out their property as well because the state of the area is in such horrible condition.

Will someone from the city please stand up and come over here and walk around and look at the disgusting mess left out there from people and do something about it?",3
Restaurants,One cute place. Amazing bartender. Good music. Cool hangout spot. Definitely worth visiting.,5
Restaurants,"I met some of my friends here on a Tuesday night. The bartender was helpful and nice even when we didn't know what we wanted to drink. Price wise it's pretty reasonable. Magoo's no longer has karaoke here, but they do have a couple of pool tables. They also have slot machines around the bar. I noticed they also serve food, but never saw a menu. 
Overall, if your looking for a local spot that is reasonably priced and has a friendly staff this place fits the bill!",4
Restaurants,"After a horrifying experience at another establishment on St. Patrick's day, a friend invited us to Magoos, to spend the rest of the evening with him and another group. 

This was my first visit to Magoos, but I will absolutely be back. 

Its open, spacious, and clean, with 2 pool tables and plenty of seating.  

They had some killer St. Patty's day specials ($3 everything, basically: car bombs, Jameson shots, and cheap Guinness), and their standard drinks were reasonable too.  I had the best Bloody Mary I've had in about 3 years here for about $6.  

Tom, the bartender, was amazing.  
We're kind of an unruly group, and we got pretty loud and crazy, and he was polite, gracious, and took really good care of us. 

Oh, also, the mac n cheese bites are to DIE for.  Highly recommended!!!

I will absolutely be back again, even though its a bit of a drive for me, the great service is 100% worth the drive.",5
Restaurants,"Eh, 3 stars for them because the bartender ignored me for about an hour when i kept asking for water or any drink, and there was only 3 people in the entire place. Love the cabin feel inside , makes me fell like im camping lol other than that its a good place.",3
Restaurants,Well it isn't magoos lodge anymore and honestly I don't know what anyone saw in this place if magoos was anything like this! Bar staff isn't very attentive I stood at the bar for a good ten minutes before they even asked if they could help me and there was maybe three people in the whole bar. I heard great things about the food but now that this place is the rustic lounge I guys they decided all that food want necessary cause there is no good in this establishment. It's dusty in here and even for a dive just a really crap place to be at any time of day. With all the killer options around here like legends and hammers if I were you I would just pass by this hole in the wall bummy crowd and really not anything as nice as it looks from the outside.,1
Public Services & Government,since its the only one in Vegas i have to have them. its such a shame everytime ive called horrible experience. would rather go to the dentist. .000000001 star.,1
Public Services & Government,"Not the worst utility company I've EVER worked with (eh-hum, SDGE), but definitely plenty of room for improvement.  Unfortunately there is little choice in the desert, which I also hate.  I don't think there should be a monopoly on who we get our water from.  Or electricity for that matter, we should have the freedom to choose, so that when a company DOES have this many bad reviews then we can simply avoid or change our service.  I don't like that they are open four days a week, that they require the deposits up front (every other service I've ever worked with will work with you, not just withhold service, seems wrong in the desert!), you MUST pay by credit or debit card....I guess I'm really cheesed because you're FORCED to do these things that may or may not fit into your plans.  If you can't do it, tough nuggies, no water for you.  I don't know, Americans are slowly getting their rights taken away one-by-one, I don't think it's right for a monopoly company to be able to do that with an essential resource.  Any suggestions on how we could combat this are welcome, I'd really like to do something about this,",2
Public Services & Government,"These people are the reason why antitrust laws against monopolies exist.  And yet somehow they are an exception to it.  It must be nice being the only company in the desert with control over the water.  Dont even bother with their first level of customer service if you have a problem, ask for their manager right away.  These entry level people must be put in place as 'gatekeepers'.  They have the worst ""there's nothing we can do its your fault"" attitude i have ever seen.

But there's really nothing you can do so since they hold all the cards so cheers to the nightmare.",1
Public Services & Government,Way to go Las Vegas Water District... NOT!!! I had a hot water leak under my house. The gas company did us a favor by coming to our house and shutting off service because they realized there was unusual usage. But Las Vegas Water District did NOTHING! You would think since we are in the middle of a drought they would want to do ANYTHING to save water right?? It seems like all they care about is collecting your money. The only time I can get a hold of someone is when they want you to pay your bill but will not go out of their way to help. No courtesy call or anything to inform me that gallons of water was gushing out OR that my water bill is now $1000.,1
Public Services & Government,"i want to know (i'm only one person) why my water bill went from $20.00 (with the five dollar tack-on) to 24.50 to 27.00 when i have the same usage, in fact I have not been using my sprinklers because of all the rain.  Do you just indiscriminately raise the rates without notification?",1
Public Services & Government,"Holy F.. Las Vegas Valley Water District has got to have worse customer service. Called on Thurs, 3/20 to activate service at a home I'm purchasing so that the property would be ready for a formal inspection, the service rep initially provided a 24 hour timeframe to activate water service and a new account number. Come Sat, 3/22 (two days later), the lock is still on the water valve.

Called LVVWD and spoke to a Cust Service Rep named Nicole. This girl was pretty condescending, rude and no help. Unfortunately, she's not the only customer service rep with the same kind of attitude.

Please OUTSOURCE your call center, I'd rather deal with someone in another country than this incompetence any day.",1
Public Services & Government,"8/29/14  10: 15 AM 

We needed to establish service so we could move this weekend...They're closed on Fridays!? kind of hard to move without running water. If course it's labor day weekend. They're not open until Tuesday. 

Wait time on their customer service hot line is outrageously long. 30 minute wait is unacceptable.

Update! 10:50 AM service on the phone was horrible. I had to help my boyfriend's mother by taking the call. She's hard at hearing. 

 Lady was hard to understand, even for me! Very thick accent. She didn't listen very well..  horrible. I had to repeat myself slowly several times,  out of frustration I had to stop to gather myself. Can not believe they hire people you can't understand over the phone. There are people who are hard at hearing, who can't understand what you're saying to begin worth. 

She needs to work on her social skills. I was clear when speaking with her & tried to keep my patience with her even though she was miserable. Most of all very rude. If you hate working with people, don't apply for a job dealing with people.

People with accents should be working desk jobs.  Face to face interaction. At least you can try to read their lips.",1
Public Services & Government,"I was actually pleasantly surprised when contacted by Melissa at the Water District to discuss my bill.  I had been aware of a drip problem and so was expecting a little bit of a bill shock because of it but to my knowledge the problem had since been taken care of and I hadn't noticed anything to extreme in my bill. Turns out her call was a head's up, so to speak.  

She wanted to know if I had noticed any toilets running constantly, any standing water in the yard, etc., anything that might explain my surge in usage.  She instructed me on where to find my meter, get the numbers and report back to her.  And she also said a tech had come out to check on it also.  

In the end my bill did go up a bit and she was able to make an adjustment to it that  brought it down and seemed more than fair and even made me aware of payment options if necessary.  Melissa returned my calls when promised, was helpful and friendly and I appreciate knowing that the Water District keeps an eye on suspicious usage and notifies customers.",4
Public Services & Government,"I would give 1 star but Karen S. the customer service agent really talked me off the ledge.  She's great and helped 100 times more than I expected.

The reason I would have given 1 star only is because I had an underground pipe burst and no one called me even though my water usage went up insanely.  No one emailed me even though I'm only on email billing.  They said they sent a letter but I never got anything from them.  My water bill is almost $500 and there's nothing I can do.",3
Public Services & Government,"So I removed myself from autopay before moving out of my old place and closed the account. They still somehow manage to automatically charge me for the last bill and the month before! And the best part? They claim I used over 9,000 gallons of water on the last month. They owe me 36 dollars and instead of sending me a check within the same week... they say I have to wait till the end of the month just for them to mail the check. That's a whole 2 and a half weeks from when I'm writing this. Where do they get off thinking they can just take my money and hold on to it and giving it back whenever they feel like it? What if my budget was really tight and needed that money? 

I asked to speak to a manager and they said that I have to wait 3 days for a call back. Are you effing kidding me? Screw this company. I'm going to call them everyday until I get my damn money back. They are so quick to help you pay your bill but when it comes to them having to give money back that they wrongfully took from you, they expect you to wait a lifetime. To hell with that! With that kind of service, you're better off collecting gallons of water from Lake Mead and living off of that. 

How would you feel if I took money from your wallet without your consent and told you I'll pay you back whenever I feel like it? I'm sure you'd call the cops and have me arrested. These guys are doing no different from that example and they get away with it just because they are a company.",1

Hakuna Matata - I was here for a burger.

Mission accomplished!",4
Restaurants,"I just ordered a combo number 1, no tomatoes, med with a curly fry and a Pepsi. And 2 of the 2 for $1 tacos. After I was done ordering I asked for two ranches and she said she'll have them for me at the window, when I paid and got my food I had asked for hot sauce and I didn't mention the ranch because I was just told she would have them. I was the only one in the drive thru at the time. I get my food and come home, started taking the food and handing it out and I noticed there were no ranches. I said that's fine, and opened up my food and there were freaking tomatoes! Now most people will think that this is stupid to get mad and write a bad review about, but I work fast food and it irritates me when I come across people who don't care about their job or their customers enough to get the smallest parts of orders right. Anyone who works fast food isn't going to absolutely love their job, but that doesn't mean that you have to be lazy and not do your job right!",1

Restaurants,"This is a NY pizza by the slice place in the ""food court"" next to Harrahs. You also have the option of Chipotle, Panda Express, or McDonalds. I chose pizza because the others had long lines, but immediately regretted my decision when I was charged almost $7 for a (mushroom and pepperoni) slice only slightly larger than normal. I could have bought a whole Chipotle burrito for that price. They warmed up the slice and I ate it, but it tasted average. You can bet that next time, I will choose to wait in line for another restaurant to get a better value for my money.",1
Restaurants,"Yuck....dry bread, over cooked meat, no flavor. The crappiest part, somehow it added up to 20 bucks. I'm so bummed.  I had to eat it though...I was starving....I'm guessing I would have been more satisfied if I ate my $20 bucks instead.",2
Restaurants,"So disssapointing, the bread was dry, and the meat portiion was very small. The price was ridicoulos $10 for the combo of a med drink, sanwhich, and old fries.",1
Restaurants,Moment of weakness. They got my simple order wrong. No flavor. And the cheese part o the Philly Cheesesteak is practically MIA. Avoid unless you just want to burn money.,1
Restaurants,"Daaamn, what's with all the hate? Granted I don't know much about Philly Cheesesteaks, but my sandwich was still very good. The bread wasn't dry at all, and the sandwich had good portions of meat and grilled onions along with the cheese wiz. Only complaint was that it was pretty expensive. But it IS in a tourist trap food court, so they're gonna milk you for as much as they can.",3
Restaurants,"My eyes saw philly cheesesteak, my stomach growled yes, then my legs took me there. A mindless decision on my part.

A hint of buyer's remorse trickled up upon checking in on Yelp, then came in a raging torrent of disappointment after taking the first bite. Never knew it was possible to have such bland food. There was no flavor in the bread, meat, onions, or peppers at all, not even in the hot sauce that I added! Were they allergic to salt and spices?

I swear I didn't know better, but now I do.",2
Restaurants,"Stopped by here last weekend and wasn't too impressed at all.  Sandwich was just alright and fries were nothing to really savor.  I had a small sandwich, fries, and drink that came out to be a little over $10.  I think i would expect a little better since this is Fashion Show Mall but I guess not every place sets high standards.",2
Restaurants,"What an awful experience it was eating at this place.   The cashier had poor listening skills and no patience in taking orders.   You get no cheese in this cheese steak.  As the other reviewers stated, their food is bland.  Should gave gone to Wendy's just in the next stall.",1
Restaurants,"Pricing: Good-Expensive. The sandwich isn't pricey, but the combo options were.
Quality: Poor. Blandest thing I have ever eaten.
Turnaround: Poor-Good. Came right before closing, but still this is suppose to be fast food.
Service: Good. No attitude and provided everything I needed.

Sadly, this is one of the few places that I have nothing good to really say about them. Their pricing was not comparable to anything I have had before and bordered on being way too expensive for a simple meal. Why would anyone pay $3 for a measly side of fries? The worst was the food. I never knew beef mixed with onions and peppers can be so devoid of flavors like this sandwich was. I am actually amazed, but since I had paid for this meal, I feel cheated instead. The meat, although tender, had no taste to them and I would have doubt I was even eating beef if I had not known I ordered a Philly cheesesteak. Moreover, the sandwich was dry, even with all the onions and peppers that would normally be oozing juices. The cheese was also strangely nonexistent so the sandwich was really just a bunch of beef sitting around doing nothing. The turnaround was also pretty sad. This is suppose to be fast-paced eatery in the middle of a food court and given that the items are either grilled or fried, I expected speedier service. In addition,  I was the last customer before they closed with not another soul in sight so I had no idea of what the holdup could even be.",2
Restaurants,"Ok as far as mall food goes this was GOOD, I ordered and the person on the grill cooks it up fresh & hot.  I asked for my fries to be cooked a little longer so they're extra crispy,no arguing just a yes and a smile! The customer service was also good. Thank You. I'll be back :)",4
Restaurants,"Sigh. I really wanted to like it. Ive been craving a Philly cheesesteak for a couple months now and it didnt satisfy my craving. I asked for mushrooms, peppers, and onions and it still didnt have much flavor. I even drowned it in their ""spicy"" sauce. Nothing, which made me wonder what I just poured all over my sandwich. And there was barely any cheese! Whyyyyyy. The regular sized sandwich,  with a small container of fries, and a regular drink came out to a ridiculous $11.55 ugh. Not coming back again.",1
Restaurants,Terrible. The guy had an attitude that I wanted to buy a sandwich. Isn't that the point of having a restaurant?. Nobody has gone here in the past hour and I see why. They are failing as a company. Terrible service and terrible food,1
Restaurants,"Ugh, pretty bad. I'm not a super picky eater but when something sucks it sucks. Zero flavor, no seasoning, just not good at all. Pretty bummed that I wasted $10 on this.",2
Restaurants,"The one star is only cuz I didn't had any choices and they asked me to put at least 1 star..

The worst experience I ever had, bad service,I asked a sandwich with no cheese and after 10 mins I got my food and I was convinced there is no cheese,but it was there,i went back to the seller and he said its mayo,I am  allergic to any dairy  products and they gave my order with cheese even at the 2nd time when I told them I'm allergic...I almost got to the hospital and I will sue them soon..

No military discount and the girl taking order was not very social.

Thank goodness theres an excellent OPH in this part of town.",4
Restaurants,"I always go at least twice when I visit my folks in LV.  I stick to the pancakes (duh), but the omlettes aren't too bad either.  The dutch baby (which my mom always orders) does take 20 minutes, so if someone else orders it, you might be in for a bit of a wait.",5
Restaurants,"Breakfast!!

Nothing to WOW about.
Although their Specialty Pancakes look impressive as hell.
There is a Notice that these meals (even omelettes) may require an 18min cooking time over your basic bacon and eggs. Just an fyi.

Party of one. No counter to kick back at. Bummer.
Great service though. They are all over you, and very nice. Monica was a sweetheart.
Especially with what the servers are contending with......and you too if you come here.

Tuesday morning 10:00am. Waited only 5mins for my table.
Once seated I'm surrounded by a couple screaming kids, several folks (who remember phonebooths)  chatting away about taking their garbage cans out, or having been to Phoenix already, etc., LOUDLY.
All the while ingnoring those right in front of them? I'm finding it sad that older people have discovered public use of a cell phone too. They make loud speaking people louder.

Food is certainly worthy here. Except maybe the $3 small orange juice. Maybe even the $15 total which includes a $2 tip. And can most certainly get higher. I had a simple breakfast.

Will I come again? Probably not as a party of one. With my folks, or a ""morning after"" episode of a fine romance? Majority rules will have to win that one.

Give me the Mom & Pop breakfast joint any ol' time versus a place like this or similar.

But, your mileage may vary. I don't even want to think about a Sunday!",2
Restaurants,"I ask you what would you do when you go and pick your red Ferrari up? What is the first thing you do in that car? Put the top down, turn the bass up, light your cigarrette, and what?

I want my front parking spot, why I don't know because none of the spots there are in the shade at all, and want my breakfast. Thick slices of beautiful challah, dipped and cooked up all perfect with some strawberries. Oh, my strawberries, yes please. Extra please. Throw down some coffee with that, a little O.J. ya'll and watch your fingers. If you get too close to my toast you're gonna lose a hand. I'll even take an extra order to go knowing that they don't do takeout orders. That way I know I'll be totally taken care of in three hours, when my sugar high has crashed and I know I want more. I've even had my french toast with a glass of Chateau D'Yquem. That's sick. And it was delicious.

The service is fast, they have conveniently located restaurants. They close early, I think about 2:30 pm, so get your hungover asses outta bed and get some breakfast. It's a whole hell of a lot better than that IHOP shit they're always trying to feed us. I know it's not Waffle House guys, but that's a whole different story.",5
Restaurants,"I absolutely almost died here choking on french toast, but the french toast is amazing, so I still come here. Their french toast is also special -- they use sourdough bread, light egg covering, and sprinkle powdered sugar on it. This is what french toast should actually be. Well it is what it should be in the Southwest United States according to wikipedia, but that's where I am from so take it! 

They also have fresh orange juice, great prices, and very friendly service. Be careful to go on Sundays around 9-10 because there's a church up the street where nearly everyone attends Original after.",5
Restaurants,"Yum. We love this place. It's exactly like the one in Royal Oak MI... I guess I never knew it was a chain! The omelets are awesome!! They are absolutely huge, you could probably split it with someone if you wanted. It nice and fluffy (I think because they bake it?) I recommend the veggie one, very good !

The bulgar wheat pancakes rock! I know what your thinking.....but I swear they kick ass and they are good for you (kind of ;)) This place totally owns IHOP! You have to check it out!

Can't wait to try the french toast you are all raving about. I love the omelets so much I have a hard time trying anything else!",4
Restaurants,"To me breakfast is my most important meal of the day and this place does breakfast to its best!! living in Vegas at the time  while attending school for  Interior design, I decided to check this place out after hearing so many great things about it , not only in LV but in California .Wow Everything from there chocolate chip pancakes to there omelets are Amazing!! There omelets are fluffy and the size of my head,hard to finish, but just absolutely delisious.And there pancakes OMG!!Incredable I have since then tried choclate chip panckes one or two other place s and they just dont compare.It has been a while since i have been there but look forward to visiting once a gain",5

Restaurants,"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat with a friend since I live close by. The bar had customers but the restaurant area did not.. We were the only two in the dining area lol

The woman server was nice and nobody else to serve so was always around. 

They have a tv in the dining room area and we ordered some nachos and watched tv. The nachos were good. Lots of cheese, and toppings. 

I will return",4
Restaurants,Ordered a breakfast to go and OMG was the french toast with apples was to die for...was very Impressed with how efficient they were with all the necessary eating utensils to make sure I was able to eat in stil while on the go...I will be back for more for sure!!!,5
Restaurants,"Cool place. Went on a Sunday night, so it was pretty slow! I like the atmosphere; a little dive-y, but still awesome. Drinks aren't watered down at all & the bartender's really chill too. He made it a point to call us by name & make good conversation. He even gave us 2 free drinks on a $22 tab. Really nice dude. Didn't try the food but saw others eating what seems to be decent bar grub. Definitely gonna come back!",4
Restaurants,"Stopped in here on a Friday night,The bartender (Mike) was grungy looking ,with his hat on backwards,He was so tweeked out ,i couldn't understand a word he was saying,I observed him make several trips to the restroom with customers ,It appeared to me he was selling drugs over the bar,I will never step foot in that dump again",1
Restaurants,"This place is very good.  I've been here many many times and can attest to it being consistent too.

There's a variety of Italian dishes, salads, appetizers, and personal size pizzas.  It whoops up on anything in a 5 mile radius for Italian.  

I'm a personal fan of their rigatoni smoked chicken entree. Other contenders are the Tortellini Principesa, the gnocchi with blush sauce, and the 4 cheese pizza.

They often offer a fresh seafood entree special, which will always be fantastic.  

The owner Vince is ultra nice and is usually chef'n it up in the back, so quality control is top notch.

They also have Bira Morreti on tap.",4
Restaurants,Closed.,1
Restaurants,"Firefly is yet another Food Fight Inc establishment in Madison, this one catering to the Asian fusion set.  Like all Food Fight Inc. places, the decor seems to have been given a larger budget than the menu.  Anything you can find on the menu here (curries, pad thai, etc..), you can find a better version of at any of Madison's other Thai places.  Skip it and head to Sai Bai Thong down the street.",2
Restaurants,Really cool atmosphere.  Mediocre food.,2
Restaurants,"The only reason why I can imagine one going here is one member of your party wants sushi, the other wants some kind of Americanized wrap and chips, and yet another wants curry?  You could get all of those things separately and better tasting  elsewhere, but if you need them in once place, I guess you should go to Firefly.",2
Restaurants,"Ok, there's something to be said about a restaurant that is two blocks away from your house.  Especially if they DO have yummy and fruity Mai Tais, and Lemongrass Martini that's LOADED with alcohol.  On Friday afternoons, it's rather a cool hangout, and great ambiance. 

Their food, however, sucks.  It's supposed to be Asian fusion, and while I am still enjoying any ""fusion"" type place (aka, a hint of ethnic, a ton of Americanization), this is rather mediocre food at best, completely vegetarian unfriendly (which is odd, given the fact that this is Madison).

Service is good though, the staff is kind and attentive.

But I'd only go there for drinks.  Only because well.. I can walk to and from home.... And get a LOADED martini... YUM!


***** UPDATE *******

The Firefly Martini, with the ginger infused vodka, IS TO DIE for.

Restaurants,"THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE GOOD FOOD FROM 2005????

This used to be high atop of my list. But several cooks, and two years later, their food has gone completely downhill. Don't worry though, this place is on University Ave between Madison and Middleton, and since most people eating in Madison won't drive too far, there is no worry of accidentally walking into this place. If you do, turn around and RUN out. 

Lettuce wraps used to be with butter lettuce, now iceberg?
Curried Beef Short Ribs used to be incredible, now the recipe is completed different, and sorry, but not very good.

You would be better off fasting than eating here.",1

Arts & Entertainment,"If you were lucky enough to see their show before Roy was tragically mauled on stage by one of his famous white tigers, you know what an amazing experience it was.  My own experience was enhanced by the fact that we somehow scored seats in the front row, right under the elephant's ass when it appeared out of nowhere in front of us.  Unbelievable.  How'd they do that? You can still hang with the famous felines and even meet the duo with a trip to their Secret Garden at the Mirage Hotel.",5

Arts & Entertainment,"First show I saw on my first trip in Vegas. It was cool.

Sad what happened though!",4
Restaurants,"Great soups, excellent pastries, top notch egg salad and not nearly as froofy as the upstairs restaurant.  I love the yellow walls and red ceiling.  I will go out of my way to have lunch at this place.",4
Restaurants,"Can be extremely crowded during farmer's market hours, but it remains a warm spot for excellent soups, salads, and pastries, not to mention face-making at adjacent babies.",5
Restaurants,"Stopped here for a late lunch on a cool spring day and was surprised to find superior quality cafe fare, from espresso and brioche to sandwiches and salads -all top-notch! Warm, friendly atmosphere and fast, friendly service. A wee expensive for my income bracket, but still a place I'll happily take big-city visitors for a midday bite.",5
Restaurants,"The sandwiches here are WAY, WAY over-priced.  I paid almost $6 for a HALF an Artesian Farmer Trout salad sandwich (it was served with their house made potato chips which were quite good and a quarter of a pickle).  The sandwich was ok.  The trout was definitely fresh, but it needed some salt and pepper and maybe something onion-y.  I also tried the chocolate croissant which was mediocre and cost almost $4 - don't get me wrong, I get the whole hand-crafted organic baked goods thing and I would definitely pay top dollar for some really outstanding baked goods, but this wasn't outstanding.",3
Restaurants,"I come here 3-4 times a week because it's conveniently between my apartment and bus stop. Their coffee, espresso drink (good cappuccino), chai, and my favorite - black currant tea are good. The staff is pretty friendly. During summer, try their lemonade - it's super tangy with a hint of lavender - it's super refreshing and delicious!

I think their pastry is way overpriced for the quality, though .... . If you want the best croissant in the town, I recommend ""Sophia's cafe"" on Johnson (they are open only on the weekend)",4
Restaurants,"Handmade organic brats made the night before served with homemade horseradish mustard, nice cool lemonade served outside on the street during farmer's market.  Nice casual cool cafe, sandwhiches, salads, pastires, organic and homemade and reasonably priced.  The brats were probably the best I ever had.  I would have bought a jar of the mustard if they sold it.  The mushroom soup was delicous.  Here is a great place to relax after farmer's market.  It's also a nice place to come for coffee, dessert and conversation.",5
Restaurants,"I stopped in here for lunch with one of my friends during the farmer's market. The food was excellent, everything was extremely fresh and very high quality. I had a grilled chicken panino with chevre cheese and bacon, and a strawberry-rhubarb lemonade. The bacon in the sandwich really stood out as being superb, I guess it came from a farm called Willow Creek in Baraboo. The food is fairly expensive compared to, say, Subway (...) but the emphasis on using great ingredients is really reflected in the food.",5
Restaurants,"This is one of my must-have stops when I go to the farmers market.  Everything is unbelievably excellent.  The Magic coffee is my favorite, and the butter croissants.  

But seriously, everything is just so good.",5
Restaurants,"I haven't had lunch at Cafe Soleil yet...but the bakery happy hour is absolutely worth a visit (maybe even an extra 1/2 star for value!).  The espresso drinks are well done (on 4 of 5 occasions) and the savory croissants are lovely, as is the blueberry cream cheese croissant.  The homemade lemonade is delicious and refreshing, especially with free refills.  I've lucked out on days with blueberry and raspberry lemonade...yum!  Local cheeses and farmer's market goods as an added bonus. 

Spend a lazy afternoon here, reading the paper or working on a paper.  Avoid the hectic farmer's market crowd on Saturdays.",4
Restaurants,"Get there relatively early for some of the best almond chocolate macaroons. Stuffed from the farmer's market? Just try one for 75c! 

If they're out of macaroons, try their homemade brats. I actually couldn't taste why their $5 price would be nearly double of Top Dog's (in Berkeley) but could definitely see how being local and organic and all that could up the price. Regardless, it's juicy, it's good, and the toppings are pretty special. Especially their mustard. I even ventured as far to try to buy it but they don't sell it. Seedy with that authentic mustard test that is hard to find at local markets in the US. Just be sure to try the mustard. It's kickass.",4
Restaurants,"All Soleil's food is wonderfully fresh and ""99.999999999%"" organic.  Best pastries in town, no contest.  The croissants and brioche are perfect.  The coffee is always top-notch and their house chai is spicy and authentic--forget the syrupy from-concentrate stuff you might get at other cafes.  Their sandwiches are pretty expensive for the amount you get, but the quality makes up for it.  I am a big fan of the Farmer John's Provolone.  Breakfast sandwiches come with a very good carrot and fruit salad; lunch sandwiches come with tasty chips that I think they make themselves.",5

Restaurants,"The almond marzipan croissant and magic coffee are probably the two best things I've ever stuffed into my gullet.

One star off because the guy working was a total asshole to us both days that we went. I'm pretty sure it's 2009, but he would only ask my boyfriend questions even though I was the one answering. He was also the kind of barista who grabbed a cup for hot coffee if he even THOUGHT I was going to say coffee and he gave us our total before we were done ordering. Newsflash bud, you are working behind a counter pouring coffee, not curing my diabetes. The attitude just comes off as totally foolish and idiotic.",4
Restaurants,Best raspberry lemonade I've ever had in my life. Loved the grass-fed roast beef sandwich with wisconsin cheese...mmmmmm; yum. I actually wouldn't recommend it on a farmer's market Saturday because it gets too packed for me! But lunch on a weekday is divine.,5
Restaurants,"This place is one of the few in madison that offers local/fresh ingredients that look and taste amazing.  Not only do the soups and sandwiches taste amazing...but the coffee/beverages and very interesting and delightful pastries are great!!!!!!!

It's a bit pricey, but for what you get and the easy on the conscience feeling you are left with---definitely worth it.",5
Restaurants,"One of the most amazing and creative pastry cafes I've ever been to. Absolutely excellent. Had a cherry cream cheese Danish, a herbed chevre croissant with sundried tomatoes and a blueberry peach croissant. (Couldn't stop myself!) Aside from the amazing yummy insides, the croissant outside was perfect: light, fluffy and crispy. Latte was also solid. A little crazy on Saturday during the farmers market but most are taking it to go so we instantly found a table to sit at to relax and enjoy our amazing feast. Will definitely be coming back again soon.",5
Restaurants,"YUM! Great food and friendly service made this a terrific recommendation from a local friend. I had half a Tuna Nicoise sandwich with lovely locally-grown tomatoes, arugula, free range eggs, and fresh baked grainy bread. The olive tapenade really put it over the top. Even the waffle-cut chips had loads of salty, garlicky flavor. Husband had soup of the day - red lentil curry - which was velvety soft with warm curry flavor - delicious!! The menu is brief in items but long on description of the contents and their origins, which I greatly appreciated. And the coffee is fairly traded through local roaster Just Coffee. Excellent pick. I will definitely visit again before I leave town.",5
Restaurants,"Their portions can seem pretty tiny when compared to most other restaurants.  But I've rarely had something that is not delicious, which is by far more important than quantity.

Would highly recommend ""The Italian Job"" sandwich.  Wish their iced tea was better.

Still seems just a tad overpriced, but not enough to deter me.  Yet.",4
Restaurants,"2 words- magic coffee. Ohmygosh. Absolute heaven. And this coming from a girl who likes her coffee as black as midnight in the north pole during the winter solstice? Yes, indeed.

Oh and the food's good too. haha. I love everything Chef Tory makes. Plus the home made chips are to die for.",5
Restaurants,"I really like Cafe Soleil for the fresh, local menu options.  Everything I've ordered has been very tasty.  I think the lunch options are great and the pastries are amazing.  Great location right on the Capitol square and the interior of the cafe has a nice atomosphere.  Maybe it is a little pricey but I try to remind myself that quality ingredients cost more.  I do hate when it is more crowded and you run the risk of ordering and then standing eyeing tables, hoping someone will move on.  All in all, a great place for breakfast or lunch - you can feel good about what you are eating.",4
Restaurants,"We just came in from a road trip starting around the Chicago area and had about ten minutes before they closed for the end of lunch hours...Even so, the hostess behind the counter still invited us in and said we could stay as long as we like...We were in a huge rush (trying to make a tour at the Red Gym) anyway...The environs were nice and comfortable without being stuck up.  The mushroom soup we had was rich and delectable, and the Big John Burger was ""marranito"" and delicious (and the brown/purple chips...Yes, the place was not cheap but you get what you pay for...I highly recommend it (especially if you have more than ten minutes to eat!",4
Restaurants,"Cafe Soleil is great.  First of all you need to get a pastry while you're there, it's the strong suit of the Cafe.  I strongly recommend the pain au chocolate, it never disappoints.  Also any of the bakery goods that use fruit tend to be very good, plus you can be sure of the quality of the produce used in not only the delicious fruit pastries but throughout the entire kitchen, as the farmer market and other local suppliers add largely to the quality and appeal of this cafe.  
Keep an eye on the soup specials.  The soup of the day always uses the freshest in season produce  and often has a very interesting twist to it.  For lunch I highly recommend the Big John burger.  The burger uses local beef and has a delicious and unique sweet and sour sauce and aioli.  The burger is slightly tangy and very satisfying.  Also, if you're a coffee drinker like me they have pretty good coffee, also it's a bottomless cup that you can keep refilling yourself.  Check this place out!",4
Restaurants,"After a couple more Cafe Soleil experiences, I'm thinking it's necessary to change my rating to 3 stars - ""A-OK.""  I'm just unfortunately not a fan anymore.

$3.50 for a croissant?  Wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that the day I tried the almond marzipan croissant it was overcooked, dry, and tough.

Maybe I'm just too sensitive, but *golden* brown = delicious, whereas *oops I let them cook just a bit too long* brown = not.  And although marzipan can usually redeem anything for me, it just couldn't compete with the overwhelming almost-burned flavor.",3
Restaurants,"This is one of those places you feel good eating at afterward, even if you get the Ruben (which, I did). All of their ingredients are local, organic, fairly/sustainably raised, etc.  And you can actually taste the freshness. But it's not soooo simple that its bland or boring.  Their sauces are also well made and I think the composition of the different plates is really well thought out.  The portions are ample, but not midwestern-big (a plus, in my book).

The interior of the place is cute, and sunny (imagine that, living up to its name). And the service is sweet and quick.

Only minus one star for being a bit pricey for a bfast/lunch/cafe...but I suppose you get what you pay for!",4
Restaurants,"Downtown Madison is undergoing a bit of a revamp as of late.  New luxury condos are popping up all over the place and once dives are bought up and turned into swanky bistros.  Cocoliquot is one of those places.   

Located on the first floor of a new condo building, Cocoliquot serves admittedly tasty french cuisine and cocktails (pleasantly surprised by my peach manhattan) in a fashionably dark decor.  However, I can't jump on board with this type of dining.  Dainty plates of cheese and handmade chocolates, while nice, aren't exactly what I'm looking for a Friday night.  

But neither is $500K condo.",3
Restaurants,"Hooray for another place in Madison that satisfies my love of French cuisine!!  I ate at Cocoliquot with a group of 6 friends.  It was perfect for us!  We each ordered a couple of the ""little plate"" dishes and passed them around.  Basically this amounted to us trying almost everything on the menu.  The whole philosophy of the restaurant is small, appetizer-sized plates, which I like because you can try so many things!  Prices range from $4 for a tiny cheese platter to $12 for foie gras.  Even though I don't feel like I ate a lot, I was definitely filled up...that's the beauty of French food.  I'd recommend the chevre (I'm obsessed) and the mussels.  It was about $20 per person including tip for two items and a dessert per person.  I would recommend this for a large group of people or a romantic date where you don't mind using your fingers or feeding each other!  5 Stars.",5
Restaurants,"I very much enjoyed the modern interior but was slightly let down by the food.  I thought that it didn't quite match the presentation (which was excellent).  I could have just been the dish that I ordered that night, so I'm going to have to try it again.",3
Restaurants,"People, people...

If you want french cuisine, go to Nadias (or, gulp, L'etoile - even if L'etoile and I have a hate-love-hate relationship that inhibits me from even writing the review).

If you want DELECTABLE desserts, full of sugary goodness that makes you thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster (or whatever your Deity may be ;) for Chocolate then THIS is the place. 

Hell, this is the one place I'm VERY content in letting the Chef decide for me (I once dumped a guy for trying to order, what am I, 5 in the 1950's?), and I contently tell him ""Give me the Tasting Delight"".  I swear EVERY TIME 'dang, I should just order this for me', after saying to the table 'Oh don't worry, we can share"".  And everytime at the end, I""m glad because for some odd reason, 5 sushi like desserts are a TON, and easily eaten by 3 people.  But, in the grand tradition of french cuisine, the FLAVOUR is so bright and bursting, you only need one tiny bite to feel COMPLETELY satisfied with the taste and the texture and the flavour of the dessert.

And the chocolates.... WOOOOOOOAAAH the chocolates....   Passion fruit vainilla...... Chocolate Cardamon... Hazelnut... Macademia Nut... Pine nut.. (Ok, that's Christopher Guest's Best In Show channeling)... One tiny bite is SERIOUSLY orgasmic.  

I highly recommend going to dinner somewhere else, and going here for desserts.

Because frankly, everything ""washed down"" with a Ma vie en Rose (Pink Wine, Orange Liquor and Bubbly) makes you feel as giddy and happy as the first time you strolled down the Champs Elysees watching the Eiffel Tower....

THE ONE COMPLAINT I WILL HAVE (YES I'm SCREAMING) is their !@#$#@#!#@#@$ no Saturday brunch, but Sunday brunch.  COME ON.. Saturday is also a day that people need food.  ESPECIALLY now in the summer, after a long arduous walk around the Farmer's market.  DO YOU KNOW how much pushing I had to do so to evade the masses of strollers in the square????!!!!


*****  UPDATE  *******
If you go just before the kitchen closes (at 10:00pm) and order a plate of fries (Super Moe tradition) they will hook you up and give you a bucket's worth.  I'm serious.  However, their fries are not the salty goodness that I expect from this food category.  I mean, they were hot, the aioli served was pretty good, but frankly, I'd rather the fries at McD's.... Again, reaching the conclusion that Cocoliquot is THE dessert place... Nothing else...

Restaurants,"This is a French wannabe restaurant, but oh well, it tries hard. It's like if an ordinary Peter changed his name to ""Pierre,"" put on a berret, but forgot to fake the French accent.

If this review sounds snobby, it's because I've been spoiled by bona fide New Orleans restaurants for years. 

Let me start with the good, first though: The banana chocolate dessert bursted with flavor, and their cinnamon donuts were to die for. To give the restaurant credit, they also had a lovely, fresh chive cream cheese you can tell they made from scratch on the premises. But the waitress looked at my aunt like she had just asked to ""peel her a grape"" when she asked the bagels be cut into quarter sized pieces. Ha ha ha.

When I ordered a Croque Monssieur, it came with a white sauce that it ""said"" was bechamel, but come on: it's supposed to be more off-white and not be so bland.  My aunt made fun of the fact it was not on a french sort of toast but on white bread. Tacky. Perhaps Wonder? ;) Le sigh. Can you really be ALL that discerning about Parisian cuisine when you are in the land of beer and brats?",3
Restaurants,"I haven't been here for dinner yet (I'm still working on that) but I have been here for brunch twice.  

The first time we sat outside on the patio.  It was nice and relaxing but a little too windy (we had to hold our mimosas (yum) tightly on the table for fear they would go flying into our neighboring table - next time I'll bring my crazy glue).  We had the asparagus frittata with Gruyere cheese with a salad and cinnamon donut as a side, the Croquet Monsieur (ham & cheese sandwich with egg) with salad and a side of their Bacon Bread Pudding.  All very yummy.  They serve small portions which is great (for me) but if you're looking for a hefty brunch this is not the place to go.  

The second time we came for brunch we sat inside by the window and had the Poached Eggs Smoked Trout Casserole and the Pan Perdu (french toast) with rhubarb, orange & creme fraiche compote with a side of the Bacon Bread Pudding.  All very good, but I didn't finish the bread pudding since I already had my fill of the french toast.  I wish they would have had a choice of fruit on their ""sides"" menu.  

On to the chocolate: like little pieces of beautiful art served and displayed on a cool slab of marble.  Fresh and delicious!",4
Restaurants,"CocoLiquot has closed.  Per the CocoLiquot web site (http://www.cocoliquot.com/), their space will be taken over by Restaurant Muramoto. Happily, their chocolatier is opening his own chocolate shop, David Bacco Chocolats, in Hilldale Shopping Center in May 2008.",3
Local Flavor,"Matsuri is a yearly festival that takes place in downtown Phoenix every spring.  I have been attending (and volunteering) at this festival for more than 5 years and it's grown overwhelmingly in that time.

Matsuri started as a major showcase and auction for koi owners in the valley but it has grown to a big event that's enjoyable for everyone.  

The festival features vendors selling native and pop-culture items from Japan, a display of Bonsai and fine art, and entertainment of martial arts, music and fashion.

Keep an eye on the website for dates and information.",5
Local Flavor,"I made it out there by my lonesome yesterday. WICKED COOL! The drumming was amazing, the swordsmanship was cool, and the guy sculpting with wax was pretty neat. There was a large contingent of anime cos-players out, and it was fun to see all the costumes. And check out the Buddhist Temple's stand for some of the best yakisoba in town.",5
Local Flavor,"Awesome festival. Crazy costumes, fun performances, lots of souvenirs, bonsai trees, crazy anime kids, and lots of food. The boy and I went Sunday and it was outrageously busy. We walked around for a while, picked up some steam buns and kaluei (?) ice, and did some people watching. It was a good time.",4
Local Flavor,"Great festival!  Because my husband lived in Japan for several years, we had to go both days this year.  Ate, watched the entertainers, ate again, went through the booths, ate some more.  You get the idea.

If you are planning on a meal, I would suggest going late morning or late afternoon.  The food area was horribly crowded from about 1-3.  My favorite things this year were the drummers, bonsai trees, and getting my name written in Japanese calligraphy on a very pretty paper!

It's over for now, but there's always next year!",4
Local Flavor,Don't have much to say other than it was a great time.,4
Local Flavor,"This was my first time at a Matsuri and I really enjoyed myself.  We downloaded a program at www.azmatsuri.org so we had an idea of what to expect.  We came into the Square just as Kyo Rei Taiko Kai, the taiko drummers were performing.  They were powerfully rhythmic and their performance was captivating start-to-finish.  

Next, we hit the food booths.   The crowds for the food were enormous and if I had gone to the festival starving I would have been really annoyed by the time I made it to the front of the line.  Fortunately, I had the foresight to have a snack and bring lots of friends.  We found the best strategy was to divide and conquer, bringing the spoils of our line victories back to the group to share.  I hit the AZ Buddhist Temple booth for a few perfect, freshly steamed nikuman ($2 ea.) and chilled edamame ($1.50).  My husband split off to the Nagasaki Grill booth for cold somen ($5), a marinated tuna bento box that included a tasty fried chicken skewer, gyoza and a pickled slaw ($8).  At the same booth my brother picked up a bento box of chicken curry with sticky rice, plus the chicken skewer, gyoza and slaw ($8).  All of the food was exceptionally good, but the chicken skewer that came with the bento box was my favorite of everything I tasted.  

After eating we walked the tents and displays.  Masks by Zarco had a booth displaying masks and mask jewelry but their most interesting exhibit was the parade of warriors in the demon masks.  We enjoyed the Shiba Inu dogs, the Bonsai trees and the sand garden demo at the Japanese Friendship Garden booth.  All in all it took us about three hours to see everything.  If I could change one thing, I would wish that the festival had a little more of an educational aspect but then, I'm a nerd.  So that's that.  I just would have liked to learn a little more about where the traditions we were seeing developed.

One more tip:  Consider taking the light rail if you can.  There's a stop at 3rd St & Washington that's convenient to the park.  Event parking ranged from $10 to $14 in the garages and surface lots.  Yikes!",4
Local Flavor,"Even though it was rainy and chilly, we had a fun time at Matsuri.  It's a two day festival celebrating Japan.  The event is held at Heritage Park downtown.

The food was delicious, and there was about 10food vendors to choose from.  

There were even more merchandise vendors that I imagined there would be.  I ended up purchasing a wind chime, a couple bonsai trees, and a sushi making kit.  It was a little pricey, but there were many options to choose from, so not so shabby.

The musicians and performers were truly amazing.  I can not recall the name of the group performing with all the drums, but they were so exciting!  

Please go check this our next spring if you don't have plans!  Make these your plans.",3
Local Flavor,"Being big fans of Japanese culture, the lovely lady and I were quite excited to discover there is an annual 'Festival of Japan' in downtown Phoenix. The Japanese are cool people... let's get this straight... whenever you come across something in life that is awesome; nine times out of ten you'll find yourself saying ""Hey... I think that started in Japan"". (My blatant love of everything Japan is probably coming through quite loud and clear here...)

Even though it was quite rainy the weekend of the festival, we decided it was still worth it to brave the harsh weather (harsh weather = it was sprinkling, and there were a few small puddles to hop over... hey it's Arizona!). We went on Sunday and despite being a little worried that they'd be wrapping everything up... the festival was pretty much in full swing. There were probably about 50-60 vendors sprinkled around and in Heritage Square (In case you didn't know, as a point of reference Heritage Square is where Pizzeria Bianco is). On top of the vendors there were probably 8-10 different food places, some offering extensive menus and others offering more specific things. 

The high point of the vendors for us was the bonsai trees... which were so damn cool... we've known about bonsai trees for a long time but somehow seeing these ones in person made us leave with a ""must get a bonsai tree"" mindset. The food was pretty tasty... we indulged in quite a few random things like mochi, spicy noodles, a chicken skewer, and some shaved ice. The food wasn't jaw droppingly good, but it did the trick and was pretty good for what it was. The main reason you should go to this though isn't the food or the vendors... it's for the dyn-o-mite people watching! The cosplayers were out in full effect for this and there were all sorts of weird, wacky, and flat out interesting outfits. If seeing overweight middle aged men dressed in odd ninja outfits and young women randomly sporting furry tails sounds interesting to you... then you'll probably have as much fun as we did. 

I sure hope this festival continues, Phoenix really needs more local flavor like this throughout the year to keep things interesting... we'll definitely be back next year!",4
Local Flavor,"Had a great time on Sunday at the Matsuri with my friend. We tried a couple different stands' food and Kirin Wok's was the best and the Kilauea Ice was quite yummy! The booths offered items such as fun t-shirts, to anime items, clothing (including kimonos and modern Japanese inspired pieces), jewelry, decorative items, plushies, bonsai, swords, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed the taiko performances as well as the traditional dancers.

It was relatively crowded, but not overly so and the weather was nice for the event. It felt pretty well organized and definitely a fun place to people watch. There were several cosplayers and people who dressed up in general which was intriguing to see. Parking wasn't bad and overall we had a good time.",4
Local Flavor,"Just got back from this year's Matsuri festival, which is in its 20th year! 

Plenty of vendors selling everything from Hello Kitty to manga to bonsai trees. This year is a little smaller than previous years, but go with an open mind and a sense of adventure and you'll be pleasantly surprised by what the vendors have to offer.

If you're on a budget, do yourself a favor and just go to look. When you find something you genuinely like, ask the person working the booth for a card, or where their store is located. 

Nearly all the participants are here in Phoenix or have a website where you can buy their merchandise, and it won't be marked up for the festival.

Stop by Roka Akor and pick up their card for a complimentary appetizer!",4
Local Flavor,"The festival seemed a little smaller than what I expected, and I didn't find a lot to peruse when not looking at various food booths.  They had a lot of local Japanese restaurants selling food, such as Nagasaki Grill, Paradise bbq, and Arai Pastry, which was nice but I am close enough to all those restaurants that I could just buy their selections any time at their restaurants.  I think I've been too spoiled by the Japanese festivals in San Francisco, since the food selection here was more limited and there wasn't as many booths to buy things from.  I did like the cultural shows, such as the taiko and the martial arts demonstrations, and the shaded area with the bonsai and akitas was nice.  I think in general though, if you don't live close to Japanese restaurants or haven't had a lot of immersion into Japanese culture, this is a good way to introduce yourself to it here in Arizona.",3
Local Flavor,"This was my first year going and it was so fun and exciting.  I enjoyed the drummers, food, and especially the beer garden.  Also, the anime costume contest was fun as well as the sword deomonstrations.  What talent and skill and a very beautiful culture.",5
Local Flavor,"We stumbled upon this festival but accident but had a delightful time.  Nice entertainment, friendly vendors and even though the weather was quite windy that day, we still enjoyed the company of bonsai trees and people dressed in costume.  Why are people dressed in costume?  I have no idea ... just b'c anime is Japanese doesn't mean you should dress in anime costume to a Japanese festival but it's all good.  I like to people watch.",5
Local Flavor,"The Arizona Matsuri is a great stop for anyone interested in Japanese and Asian culture or entertainment. They have anime, manga, tea, ramen, sushi, steamed buns, martial arts, fashion, beer, wine, and arts and crafts... so much THINGS! Sure, it is small in comparison to the Matsuri(s) in California. However, for Arizona it is a nice celebration. Bring family or friends and have a stroll.",5
Local Flavor,"Take the entire population of Vermont and Rhode Island, dress them up as anime characters, arm them with parasols, and cram them into Heritage Park.

It's fair to say this festival is so successful that at mid-day, you could wait 30-45 minutes in line just to see what a booth is. The ones I got close to were pretty cool, especially as Japanese textiles are not easy to come by here.

There is a ton of stuff here -- drumming, dance, sword demonstrations, and food tents by the dozen.

If you're a cosplayer, this event is a total 5, as you're among your own people, there is a contest, and passersby will stare admiringly at you. If you're a cosplayer who grows bonsai into the shape of Pokemon, life is perfect and you have to hit this event.

If you don't like crowds and lines, you can try going right when it opens, though it starts late enough that the locals have rolled out of bed and put on their wigs and kimonos.

This is actually the cultural event that would benefit from the wide open spaces of Hance Park, as the charm of Heritage Park leaves things very squished.",3
Local Flavor,"It's not the biggest or most extravagant festival but you can tell these folks really put their heart into it. Had an opportunity to meet the Japanese General Consul and what a sweet man.
The demonstrations were great from Kyudo archery, Bujinkan jujutsu,  folk dancing, and of course Taiko drums. My family had a great time and it was enough to tucker out my 3 year old for a good afternoon nap. We met some great artists and there was a decent showing of different foods.",4
Local Flavor,"おめでとうございます！

Been coming to Matsuri year after year since I was a wee high schooler.  From anime to yukatas; takoyaki to shaved ice; cosplay contests; singing and dancing performances; ribbon-fish origami; Shiba Inu pups; bonsai trees; Miss Cherry Blossom; and more, Matsuri has it all!  It's crazy to see how big Matsuri has grown!

I remember when there was plenty of room to roam around Heritage Park.  You can stop and shop and there would be plenty of room to navigate your way from booth to booth.  Now you can't even get some snacks and food without waiting an hour or two in line!  While I love Matsuri, I'm not sure when I'll be back.  They have greatly outgrown this venue.",4
Local Flavor,"A fun little festival in the historic Heritage Square (emphasis on the little, it's only about 20 vendors and then 2 stages).  Stepping out of the parking garage, I felt transported to Japan (or at least how I imagine Japan... never been there)!  It smelled like street food cooking/being fried everywhere, the crowds were bustling and a little pushy, and there was an overall air of chaos and unique outfits/hair/costumes.

Lines for the food were looooong.  So long I didn't even bother getting something to eat although the Snoh ice booth caught my eye, as well as the Takoyaki.

I watched a few shows on one of the stages.  There was a J-pop dance group/band... I think called Pink Sugar?  I can't say that's my type of music, but I thought they put in a good effort and had good energy.

I also watched some of the shinkendo dojos perform (my boyfriend included in there).  That was also entertaining and I liked how the announcers narrated and explained things.  It was an educational experience!

Overall, a great little event.  Fun way to spend some time with family and friends a learn more about another culture.",4
Local Flavor,"I have been going to this event for so long that I can't even count on my hands. It's gotten bigger and bigger every year. Now there's even more vendors, more people, more activities, more cosplaying, more everything! I am guessing around 5 to 6 thousand people over the weekend and possibly more.

Well, if you haven't been here, you should come. A lot of local Asian restaurants set  up in tents to serve you their food. However, the food is expensive. There's other organizations here too from non-profit to schools to other random clubs. And then there are merchandise vendors selling trinkets, souvenirs, anime, plants, etc. If you are not in the mood to buy food or merchandise, you can always come hang out. It's free! There's also a beer garden area... not free though. Haha.

Besides just looking around at food and merchandise, there are plenty of performances on 3 stages throughout the festival ranging from dances, kendo demonstrations, cosplay contests, concerts and much more. It's a packed schedule and everyone that sets up this entire event does a really good job.

It's a great place to spend on Saturday or Sunday, and this only happens once a year. It's like the Renaissance Festival except Japanese stuff. And the younger people dress up as fictional characters from the favorite Japanese anime or game instead of knights and kings at the Ren Faire. And some dress in kimonos or other Japanese outfits. Well, 90% of the people are in normal clothes so don't worry... Just come enjoy the good times and warmish weather. :)",5
Local Flavor,"In short, the matsuri is fun, lots to see and do. The food overall is a big disappointment. From the sukiyaki to the nikuman and the kremepan, everything was overpriced for mediocre flavors and inauthentic dishes. 

If you are interested in buying Japanese stuff, this is a great place to get bargains. I can't believe how inexpensive some of the things are here. My son, who just returned from Japan on his mission, just kept shaking his head and saying these things should not be cheaper here as an import. 

There are fun acts to catch on the stages. You will have a variety of cultural offerings. I just wish some of these Caucasians would learn the correct pronunciation of the Japanese words and terms. 

It is free to get in but you will need to pay for parking somewhere. We paid $8 at the Catholic Diocese right across the street. My son paid $12 at another garage. 

They really need to figure out the foot traffic by the food booths. Just too crowded. 

Overall, wonderful event.",4
Local Flavor,"It's been a few years since I've been to this annual event. The good news is that the number of food booths and merchandise vendors has increased in number and quality. The bad news is that the event is perhaps becoming a victim of its own success, very nearly outgrowing its location. 

I love the fact that so many local restaurants have set up booths and that other food vendors earmark proceeds for charity. Very hot and crowded this day, however, with very long lines for much of the food. The food is not that cheap for the most part and it's unlikely that you'll find a true bargain among the imported merchandise, but did you really expect anything different at an event like this? The food is varied and enjoyable and there is merchandise you won't see everyday, at least not in downtown Phoenix. Need a Bonsai tree? Not everything offered is genuinely Japanese, but it bothers me not as long as there is fun to be had.

There is an arts and craft setup for the kids ($1 donation), but no large play area. Entertainment was solid during the time we were at the festival (three stages!!!). Lots of families in attendance. Lots of dogs. Lots of people dressed up as their favorite Anime characters. Very fun. Even though there is no admission charge for the festival, parking in downtown Phoenix can be a hassle or expensive. We chose to simply park a couple of blocks away for free (to the north and east) and enjoyed a leisurely walk with the dogs to the festival. 

We attended the annual Phoenix Chinese Week festival just a couple of weekends ago at Hance Park. Matsuri has the more diverse food, vending and entertainment of the two Asian festivals, but we had a much more relaxing time at Chinese Week. Less crowded and more for young kids to do (bouncy houses). There is, however, more choice in entertainment for older kids and adults at Matsuri. Personal preference. Good food and friendly people at both events.  We intend to return to both.",5
Local Flavor,"This was my first visit and I was really looking forward to it.  I have to agree with other reviews though in that its just a poorly managed space for the crowd they brought in.  We arrived close to the openingha at 10 am and it was very nice.  Sure the sun was bright but the vendors sold parasols for reasonable prices and mine was a cute lavender.  
The food trucks were looking bright and cheerful, the other vendors had plenty of products and they didnt all have the very same thing.  They all had about ten different things, But thats more variety than some places!  Many pokemon characters and plushies.  A whole lot of die cast cars,  Why they are at a Japanese festival escapes me, but there they are.  Paper fans, parasols, and bonsai trees.  Yes an entire forest of them!
Food vendors? They all seemed to have the same menus.  And the Buddhists were serving meat products which confused me because I thought they were vegetarians. Turns out that its a choice.  So I learned something which was nice.
I did get to go to the Japanese Tea Ceremony,  It was interesting, I may learn more about it at the local Japanese garden group.  It was probably the highlight of my day.  I also really enjoyed seeing all the anime, cosplay, just fun outfits that many of the attendees were wearing.  
However the ceremony let me out at 1230 and by then it was hotter, more crowded and well sort of hellish.  Every direction had more and more people.  Crowds of teeming masses of hordes of well you know, people, lots of them!  Every counter was swarming with them.  Didnt matter what they sold, it was being bought by desperate folks who must have been terrified of not being able to buy something!  
I discovered at this point how very expensive the festival was.  $12 for parking, $10 for the tea ceremony, $3 for a bottle of water, and approximately $200 to replace the screen on my phone after the crowds jostled me and the screen shattered.  Not a cheap date.  By this point I was done with the festival and it was about 1 pm.  Will I go back?  If its a grey and windy or raining day, possibly.  If it gets moved indoors, possibly.  If its a beautiful sunny day in downtown?  I will skip it.  Though I would like a kimono...",3
Restaurants,"The food is very good, and there are infinite possibilities to how your wrap or salad can be prepared.  

The build your own starts at a reasonable price but once you add any meat the price jumps to the $9 range (though you are getting a lot for your buck).  Another downside is they have no soda fountain, so you are forced to pace the 20oz drink of choice from the cooler...

**UPDATE 3/25/07**

I came by for a wrap after a long morning of traffic school, only to find this location is now closed.  Boooooooo!",3
Restaurants,"Being a vegetarian, you'd think I would dig this place... but it's not so hot.  The toppings are mediocre, the dressing choices are not good and it's really expensive!  (Expect to spend around $10 for lunch and a drink.)
For that kind of money I would much rather go to Sweet Tomatoes instead.",2
Restaurants,This place is gone....,1
Arts & Entertainment,"Watched his first show at Caesars Palace,  Las Vegas on 12/26/06.   Liked his TV episodes but definitely not the talk show in CP, big disappointment.  The opening comedian is much better.  His joke contents need a lot of polishing and work-on.  Especially  we had to pay high price for it.",2
Arts & Entertainment,This was an awesome show!!! I did not go in with any expectations but I left wanting more and thinking that time flew by. Jerry was a great talented artist and he does not need to graphic or swear throughout his performance to make a funny point.  He was classy and organized.  I highly recommend that you spend the money and experience a great night in Vegas with Jerry.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"I saw Jerry Seinfeld at Caesars Palace Las Vegas on Jan 30, 2009 and I wasn't impressed. He just wasn't that funny. It totally ruined my perception of him. However, his opening act was awesome.  I'm not sure, but it could have been comedian Tom Papa as the opening act.  I'd see Seinfeld again only if the tickets were free and I just wouldn't expect much. HUGE disappointment.  Save your money or go see Celine Dion, Bette Midler, or Jeff Dunham instead.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I'm a little perplexed as to how to write my review for Jerry Seinfeld's show at Caesar's Palace.  Reason being is that I won my 2 show tickets (along with my 2-night stay at the Octavius Tower) from KOST1035.  Free makes everything 5 stars!  I'll try to type something from the viewpoint of an actual paying customer.  Here goes-

Having not watched Seinfeld ever, even though it was part of NBC's ""Must See TV"" lineup,  I wasn't familiar with his style of comedy.  I've seen Jerry on TV every now & again, but nothing substantial to where I can form an opinion on him as a comedian.  

The Colosseum was the show location, the same place where Celine Dion performs.  I forgot the name of the opening act comedian (something Schmidt), but he killed.  I actually thought he was funnier than Jerry Seinfeld.  He made witty observations about subjects such as his mother, the 99 cent only stores and doctor's appointments.  He supposedly is a regular on ""The Tonight Show"", but I  haven't seen late night talk shows in a long, long time.  His set was short, but definitely wasn't filler.

Jerry himself also killed.  He made hilarious observations on relationships, marriage, kids, coffee and even restroom stalls.  He didn't resort to foul language or gross-out humor, which is a plus for me.  Shows more creativity.  I LOL'ed many, many times and felt great doing so.  After his set, he came back out & had a mini Q&A session.  Jerry was a class-act that evening.

I checked the price for tickets at Tix4Tonight when buying tickets for Donny & Marie, and they were being sold for $66.  For that price, I would recommend attending Jerry Seinfeld's show.  However for the regular $125+, I would pass.  I enjoy comedy, but not for that much money.  I'd rather see a musical act, Cirque du Soleil or impersonators for that money.  However, I did enjoy my evening and still have some of his one-liners in my head.

Excelsior!",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Got last minute tix to Jerry Seinfeld.  I was surprised he had someone open for him.  To me, a comedian opening with another is a no win scenario.  If he's not as good as Jerry we're feeling ripped off.  If he's as good we're feeling Jerry's being watered down.  If he's better than Jerry, egads.  It was too close to call at times.  Honest.

Playing Caesars is only playing one of the best theaters in the country.  It's like 4000 people in there.  You have to be a Carlin or Cosby or someone who can carry on for a quite a while.  Someone who can knock us dead slowly but effectively.

I love Jerry but he frankly isn't this league.  I think Lewis Black and Chris Rock are better at a theater this size.  He didn't suck, but like his classic sitcom, you left feeling the hour or so had ultimately been about nothing.  George Carlin, rest his cranky soul, would never blow such an opportunity.

A Note To Jerry:

The night I went some lady asked ""Where's Kramer?"" in your final Q&A session.  You responded kind of offended and said, hey, this is MY show.  You've got to understand nearly every last audience member was their because of your sitcom.  So, instead of being a sitting duck for someone to look back with some awkward question like that, be in front of it.  If I were you, I'd be ready to do impressions of every cast member.  You might think you suck at impressions, but no one will care.  That will only make it funnier.  If you're passable or even kind of good at impersonating those characters, the audience will literally swoon for you.  Trust me.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"My friend took me to this show as a surprise, but I didn't really know who Jerry Seinfeld was since I don't watch TV. LoL. I thought he was funny though. The jokes were more geared towards married couples though... and yes, I'm not married.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"If you've seen Jerry's act within the past 5 years, don't bother seeing him again.  You will be sorely disappointed.  I saw Jerry in concert and loved it.  So when I saw he was coming to town again THREE YEARS later, I jumped at the chance to buy tickets again.  Little did I know I would see virtually the exact same act, word for word, punchline for punchline, as what I saw three years earlier.  So lame!!  He was even still doing the 'Blackberry people' jokes which were painfully passé by that point.  Get some new material Jerry, please!!!",1
Arts & Entertainment,The opener was really funny and they usually aren't.  I will have to research and find out his name.  I was really impressed. Then Jerry came out. He was everything I expected and more. I have been watching him on t.v. since age 9 and I am 31. So this has been a long time dream to see his show. He is so funny my stomach hurt from laughing.  I hope everyone can see this show.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"The show was very funny and we had great seats front row. My family is a huge Jerry Seinfeld fan and so it was great to see him live. His show is all new stuff and similar humor to his other routines. I would give the show 5 stars except for one small thing. At the end of the show, Jerry does a question and answer improve bit with the audience. My brother, who is a life time Jerry Seinfeld fan , asked him to say ""Hello Newman"". Instead of doing that though he went on some weird rant to a fan who asked about when the DVD was coming out. I think the crowd would have enjoyed him saying ""Hello Newman"" more. Jerry, if by some weird chance you are reading this... could you possibly do a ""Hello Newman"" for my brother now? :)",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I should start off by saying that I am not a Jerry Seinfeld super fan. Probably not even a regular fan. To be honest, I didn't even know what to expect from him. Sure I have seen a couple of episodes of his show but not more than that. 

What can you expect? Clean and adult family styles jokes. He talks about marriage, kids, things adults love & more. 

For me the funniest segment was the marriage skit. However, within my group I must have sat in between the biggest Seinfeld fans because these guys could not stop laughing. I mean really, based on how much they were laughing I feel bad for giving three stars. But this review is based on my experience right?

Overall, I had a good time. The venue is nice, Jerry has a good grasp on his audience and can tell a good clean joke and still make us laugh.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I am not quite sure  why he got a low review score.  I was looking at it before the show started and was a bit nervous.  To be fair, I am a 100% Seinfeld fan.  From the shows, he does a bit of his own stand up, which was usually hit or miss to be honest.  Well, he didn't disappoint.  He started off kind of slow... but after about 5 minutes I was dying.  Honestly my cheeks, abs, face lungs hurt so bad from laughing the whole time. My hubs isn't such a huge jerry fan but he thought it was HYSTERICAL.  

Go see him!!! :)",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Fantastic show @ Caesars. Opening act was Larry Davis. Larry was good and only on for 10-15 mins.  Jerry was great - funny, worked the crowd and reminded me of the old Seinfeld show.  Would see him again.  Show went from 7:30 - 9:15.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"My husband has been a fan of Seinfeld since he was kid. When I found out that Seinfeld would be in town I knew I had to surprise my husband with tickets. I splurged on good seats and it was definitely worth it. I worried that maybe he wouldn't have much material left after his long running show, but he had all new material that was absolutely hilarious. I didn't have time to get bored because he kept me laughing the whole time. I can tell why Seinfeld has been able to have a career in comedy for so long.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Can't say that I was excited about my husbands choice to see Jerry Seinfeld.  Not really a fan - or so I thought.   OMG - he is incredible.   We had amazing seats and was worth it  He kept us laughing the whole time with his stories about everything under the planet.  What a story teller.  Doesn't miss a beat.  He has a clean show and talks about gambling, marriage, family, life, lounging etc.   He has a new fan!",5
Arts & Entertainment,I surprised the Mr with tickets to Jerry for his birthday.  He has always wanted to see him live.  The show starts right on time.  Be sure to get there early.  We got there 30 min early and were stuck in a long line to get in and ended up missing the first few minutes of the comedian who opened.  They do not allow outside food or drinks in.  So if you are in line finish up before you get to the front.  Don't be the jerk holding up the line.  The opener did about 15 min and then Jerry came out and did about 90 min.  I enjoyed Jerry's act.  Parts of it were a bit dated and some I had seen him do on various TV shows.  I still laughed from beginning to end.  It seems like from people I have talked to that he has been doing the same show for years.  I enjoyed it but good to know that if you want to see it again it is probably going to be exactly the same.,4
Arts & Entertainment,"Being a huge Seinfeld fan I had some really high expectations for this show but man oh man did he deliver. The entire show was fantastic and he had us laughing off our chairs from the second he came on stage. The jokes were a blend of elements from the tv show with a modern day twist. All the material was really original. He doesn't really make fun of people in the crowd or anything so don't hold your breath for that. I found it pretty cool that he had a ""Ask me anything"" Q&A with the audience at the end. 

Seinfeld is still such an incredible performer. If you enjoyed watching him back in the 90s you're sure to not be disappointed. Tickets in Vegas at the Caesars go on sale only a couple of times each year so I would snag them once they come out.",5
Restaurants,"If there are things about me that's weird I've gotta say it's gotta be because I'm like a frosted mini wheat. Give me the lean beef, and foie gras from Burger Bar at Mandalay. But Schoops - you would never know about. Schoop's is hidden at the Food Basket inside the Antique Mall. One of my employees brought it for me for lunch. I had a Double Burger with cheese and bacon. OMFG It was GREAT. GREASY...JUICY...CRISPY....Yea while you wait you roam the Antique Mall while your burger gets deliciousness from the guys who cook it by pouring all their love magic into these delectable delights.  Yea I got it fully loaded...I even referred another dept. Now their whole group has it once a week. and they're BIG BOYS....A few weeks later. Las Vegas Weekly came out with talk about Greasy Spoons and lo and behold.(what the hell does LO mean anyway?) There's Schoops. So I made my trip there.....I missed it by half an hour. The following day. I went again. I smelled and my mouth watered for their delicious patty of meat....yea. Life is good...",5
Restaurants,"Located near Souhtpoint Hotel, this place isn't a bad Mom and Pop hamburger shop.  It's just a really good homemade style hamburger place with all the stuff that can be good with hamburgers such as fries, shakes, and other great items.",4
Restaurants,"From the outside, you'd think this burger joint was a restaurant. But as soon as you walk in, you realize this is a hamburger stand that's connected to the antique mall. The prices are reasonable but the burger I got was sub-par. In fact, it was so dry, I had to slather over 2 tablespoons of mayonaise on my burger to make it edible.

It was not greasy or juicy.
It was desert dry.

I would sooner go to In-N-Out Burger before I come back here. 

The reason I gave this a higher rating of 3 stars is the kitchy location and the fact that it's been around for a long time and I hate to see old things disappear among the new. Being able to browse the antique mall while you wait for your food is pretty cool. Being able to browse the mall with a malt in your hand is even cooler.

But seriously, the burger alone wasn't worth the visit to Schoop's. I was disappointed that my ""local"" burger joint was so boring.",3
Restaurants,"Like another reviewer said, it does look like more from the outside.  When I walked in, it was actually a pretty shabby stand near the antique mall.  Prices weren't bad I guess, but the burgers were very blah as well as the fries.  Definitely are much much better places to get a good burger than here.  I'll give it one thing, it was all very fresh, as they didn't make it till we ordered it.  Maybe a decent eat if you happen to be shopping at the antique mall, but don't think we'll be coming back just for the food!",2
Restaurants,"I had this place on my list but I didnt make in time because it is now closed.

The reviews here are varied and so are the ones elsewhere. Suppossedly thiey had deep fried hamburgers like Dyers in Memphis.

Sad to see it go but there must have been a reason",1
Restaurants,Closed....WTF....NOOOOOOooooooooo. What more do we suffer? Circuit City is going out of business....the Great Indoors.....WHAT MORE?!,5
Arts & Entertainment,"Most everyone knows about First Friday events downtown, but less folks are familiar with the group that puts them on - Artlink.  This group started small, and has done amazing things for the Arts community in Phoenix.  

Though First Fridays have become absolutely huge now, and it hardly feels the same - I actually love hanging with the crowds once a year for Art Detour.

Once a year more galleries open, and lots of businesses will display art instead of just Friday night it's Friday, that Saturday and Sunday!  I've brought new people with me every year and no one is ever disappointed.  Some folks like to drive from one spot to the next and that definitely has it's advantages!  It's also fun to take the shuttle around.  You can have some fun conversations, find out the skinny on a particular gallery, or get hot spot info from the bus drivers.  And while both First Friday and Art Link are definitely All-age events, there are generally several after parties for the over 21 crowd sponsored by individual locations.

Art link has some great volunteer opportunities too, and it can be a great way for someone new to town to get to know people while learning all about the downtown art scene.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I guess this is the place to comment on First Fridays.  I went to it tonight and it was a blast.  It was really nice to see lots of kids and families out experiencing art of various types.  It's really an impressive array of work.  The quality varies, but there's something for everyone I would guess.  I only hit about 25 spots in one neighborhood around Roosevelt/1st - 7th/the other random side streets around the area.

Loved the use of the housing as studios and the welcoming atmosphere.  There were a ton of cops around too for some reason.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"* Flamethrowers
* Stare-down contests
* Cyclist activists sporting pink undies
* DJ spinning in a treehouse
* Cool beer and wine bars
* Oh yes, and art.  Real, organic art made by our local neighbors.  

It's not in New York, not in Chicago -- it's all in our downtown Phoenix.

I like to credit Artlink with single-handedly improving the vibrancy of Downtown Phoenix with its First Friday Artwalk.  It's one of my favorite pasttimes about living in Phoenix and is a true testament to the cultural destination our area has become. 

I read somewhere that it's the largest artwalk in the country now and is growing each month.   I make it a habit to go every month.  It's something everyone (art-lover or not) should experience.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Oh Artlink!  Thanks so much for keeping First Fridays Alive!  And for putting together Art Detour every year!  

I am excited to see how much better it will be now with the dis-banding of the flea market atmosphere that had taken over!  

I double the Hooray for Artlink!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Artlink saved First Fridays. 

I used to hit First Fridays every once in a while because I liked it, but couldn't deal with all of the random junk people were selling along Roosevelt. Now, not only do I love First Fridays, but I've been a vendor at each one since June and will continue to be. 

They have created a great environment for the crowd and cleaned up the vending so it's actually fun to cruise through. It's the most culture you'll find in the Valley in one night and there's something different each month. It's a great excuse to explore a part of the city that's really coming around and support local businesses at the same time. 

Next time you go to First Fridays, stop by the Durtbagz booth and say ""hi""!

If you haven't been to any of the local bars around First Fridays, you're really missing out. 

Thanks Artlink!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"The most fun to be had sober and in public...A great friday night. Plenty of art, crafts, photography, great fry bread, tamales, hot dogs and the like. Definitely headed back every month, so see ya there!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"A fun, outrageous evening to be had with your fellow Phoenicians. A little snacking, some political view points, shared, some art to be seen, some art to be watched and numerous artists and musicians to be enjoyed. How did Phoenix ever get this fun?",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Wow, did they ever fix First Fridays. I had almost given up due to the distances, the crowds, getting pushed off the sidewalk by goth kids with glowsticks and cloves.  Now it's so much better!

I mean you still get to say ""look at that effin hipster"" every five seconds, but now you are doing it from a nice, safe and blocked off Roosevelt.  Everything is accessible, no more scary walks down by vacant lots to get to the next grouping.

I got see Imperial Storm Troopers (I bet they were sweating up a storm!) 2 of the 4 Ghostbusters, the Sisters of Mercy and a guy in a pink fuzzy suit (possibly a teletubby?) who gave me a totally free hug!

Took the light rail down, had a nice dinner, walked off part of the pasta, checked out some art and had a great time people watching.   The decision to consolidate the First Fridays area was a stellar one, and I will be back for sure now - I just may wait until it cools off again.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"This review is attributable to the First Friday Event that took place on April 1st 2011.

Sorry folks, First Fridays is not for me. I went last week hoping to discover an exciting new aspect of the Valley's cultural ascendance but I left feeling totally bummed. The whole scene felt like a sort of bizarro reverse Scottsdale Fashion Square counterculture. Like day vs night, conformists vs non-conformists, capitalists vs social anarchists.  I felt like I was engulfed by people trying so hard not to fit in that they somehow managed to become clones of themselves. And you know what sucks about the whole thing?... I'll bet there are dozens of extremely talented young artists whose work is completely overwhelmed by sheer sensual overload of this spectacle. A perfect example would be this fantastically talented young girl singing and playing guitar. She couldn't be more than 16 years old. Great voice. About 35 feet away there was loud punk rock band jamming away completely drowning out our fresh faced heroine. Or, was it the opposite? Maybe I was the one who was wrong and it was my youthful singer whose little amplifier managed to get in the way of an even more talented band, maybe Phoenix's version of Social Distortion or the Misfits? Either way, I was totally disoriented....... and bummed.  

I felt the same way about the conventional art on display. I made a concerted effort to find unique works, possibly a piece that really resonated with me that I would want to see on a wall in my home. Instead 90% of what I saw there reminded me of the doodles and art class projects that my friends and I used to create when our lives were devoted to playing Dungeons and Dragons and watching Hellraiser marathons on VHS.  

On a side note, is it just me or do young people who devote their lives to blood, gore, pain and suffering annoy anyone else? If these kids think life sucks now I can't wait to see them after they end up with hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans only to realize that their newfound reality will be years and years of toiling away in the friendly confines of a 6 square foot gray cubicle. And compared to many third word citizens this new reality would be considered paradise. It's that lack of perspective that I have a hard time accepting. But we all go through our phases and I wish them the best of luck. 

Trust me, I feel horrible that I have to write a negative review. I know there is some really great stuff out there. I just couldn't find it. It didn't take me long to simply give up and start drinking. Fortunately we found a cool little place to drown our sorrows called ""Lost Leaf"" which turned out to be one of the highlights of my evening. 

The only way I would go back is if someone convinces me that they can show me all the hidden gems at First Friday buried amongst the dark alleys and dusty, vacant lots. If that happens I would be glad to revise my review and formally apologize for not having the patience to discover these cultural treasures on my own. 

And before you rip me apart for not having the ability to see the true beauty of this event please understand that I have read Chomsky, Zinn, Hitchens etc...I spent much of my youth hobnobbing with homeless buskers at The Pearl Street Mall in Boulder. I studied Marx and Engels in college and I have spent entire days soaking it all in at the Pompidou and Musee d'Orsay. And to top it off, I hand wrote ""Nader"" on my presidential ballot once, and might do it again someday. So spare me the tired accusations of xenophobia and intolerance. BTW...Go Buffs!",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I went to April's First Friday this year not knowing what to expect. Downtown was so much more crowded than I imagined it would be. I had no idea where to park since I wasn't sure what I even wanted to do other than eat at the food trucks which are located between 3rd and 5th street on Roosevelt. I ended up parking in the Phoenix Public Market lot. I got there around 8pm and luckily found a spot. Walking the streets (no, I'm not a hooker) was a bit overwhelming. There was a mix of people on the streets, but I will say that I felt like I stood out like a sore thumb.. I guess I'm on the preppy side. Popular trends were skinny jeans, cloves and bohemian folk. We basically just walked where there was crowds because there was something to see everywhere. There is so much going on with street performers, art/jewelry sellers, art galleries, that I don't feel like I even came close to fully experiencing First Friday. I was happy that I got to try some food truck goodies (bacon ice cream from Sweet Republic; banana rumballs, stuffed jalapenos, bombay fries w cucumber dipping sauce from Sunshine & Spice; portabella tacos from Carte Blanc). I'm looking forward to checking out First Friday again.. so four stars since it reeled me in! I now know to expect there to be a lot of people and some rowdiness, but lots of cops patrolling and monitoring the crowds.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"MGM Grand has renamed their La Femme show to Crazy Horse Paris.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/sCXRuzDfp78HL8NHM2nLlQ  They call this show ""a celebration of the artistry of the nude"" by ""integrating choreography, lighting and film.""

All the dancers are trained in ballet and you can see the careful and intriguing lines these performers create with every movement.  With each performance, you're bound to find at least one that strikes your every fantasy and fetish.  Their use of lighting and special effects does create an alluring feel to the stage that pulls you just a bit more.  Of course, one would have to be a bit open-minded to appreciate a show like this.  It's definitely a tease though and has you wanting more by the time you leave.

I should mention the two side acts that were mixed into the show were the weirdest things ever.  Weird in the sense that I didn't know how they fit into the whole thing, and crazy becomes some of it was just damn crazy!  

They have two shows nightly (8:00pm and 10:30pm), except for Tuesdays.  They request business casual attire and 18 and over only.  Tickets are $59/pp.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I was excited to bring my boyfriend to his first sexy show in Vegas and I had heard that Crazy Horse would deliver. The bodies of the dancers were testaments to their ballet backgrounds and some of the light tricks they played were pretty cool. Yet, I found myself quite bored for more than half the show and I was really trying to enjoy myself. And the side shows (card tricks set to salsa music and michael jackson & bubbles show) just shouldn't have been there. While pretty amusing (really the only times the people in the audience seemed to wake up) they had no place in a sexy tease show and detracted from the mood that was being set. I also think they need some fine-tuning on their soundtrack. It didn't flow and many times the music was cut-off prematurely at the end of an act which also takes away from the mood. I probably wouldn't want to see this show again.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"After 30 mins of waiting for two open seats I finally got one.  We sat right in the middle in the second row of tables.  The first few acts were alright, I wouldn't quite describe it as incredibly ground breaking, but there are some interesting displays of light and precision choreography.  Other than that, there's not much you can do with a bunch of similarly-shaped women and sub-par acting.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I agree with the yelpers who give this show less than 3 stars!  I wish I had read these reviews b4 buying the tix 4 $98 with bad seats!  I preferred the group acts compared to the solo acts they had!  

interludes suck big time!!  magic card with salsa music and ""micro"" jackson!  they did not fit the theme of sexy!

we've never been so bored at a show b4, at one point I nodded off!",2
Arts & Entertainment,It's a much better show than Fantasy!  The women are hot too!!!,5
Arts & Entertainment,"Artsy and sexy and extremely entertaining. My boyfriend and I decided to watch this show since it was at our hotel. We both had a really great time. The dancers are phenomenal and very cute! We had a couple of favorite solos but that will be our little secret. 

One disclaimer: there is a freaky Michael Jackson and Bubbles dance act in the middle of the show and I bet most people will have the same reaction as me and think ""WHY GOD WHY?""

Oh, special discount if you also stay at the MGM.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"The most amazingly beautiful women I have ever seen!  A wonderful array of sexy burlesque numbers, performed in a wonderful intimate, comfortable venue.  Not a bad seat in the place, drink service very friendly and on-the-spot.  I don't know who enjoyed this more, me or my husband.  One couple near us left in disgust, which I found hilarious, how did they not know what kind of show it was??  It wasn't dirty in the least, it was erotic and artistic and sexy.  Highly erotic, I might add. Well worth the money, every penny of it!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"*drooling*

Wow......these women were HOT. I mean CrAzY HOT. The wifey and I didnt really know what to expect but we walked out of there craving a cig even though we don't smoke. 

I've seen some topless shows before, but this is got to be the best in LV. 
I can't say enough about the ladies. Beautiful, long legged, 

*ouch*...(wifey just kicked me)

Very erotic, sexy, jaw-dropping, kick in the balls good.  I dont think this show sells out so you should get tickets pretty easily. Look for a discount online before you go. 

I bought myself a long smooth collectors glass to remind me of those legs. Now only if my collectors glass had boo..*ouch* wifey kicked me again......",4
Arts & Entertainment,"This was a really cool show!  Not just because I saw some booby.  I mean this show is very artistic, and the light effects were very very cool.   I wouldn't say this was an erotic show - no standing salute from me - but if you are the type than can appreciate the female body and like a good show then this is for you!  If you are expecting a lap dance, well... you're not on Industrial Road.

FYI... my fiance was the one that bought the tix and encouraged me to go!!   She rules.  Awesome.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Great show! There was probably one or two individual performances that dragged on a tad bit too long but all in all it was a fun, sexy show that I would have no problem at all recommending to anyone looking for a show to check out. 

My husband and I had one of the theaters signature drinks...omg it was sooo good. Forget what it was called but we got to keep the souvenir glass. Too cool. 

As a tip I would definitely recommend going to the Half Price Ticket places to get tix for this show. We paid half price and got great seats. Why pay full price if you don't have to?",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I would say all the girls have great body and they got legs!  The show itself is sexy and artistic with the lights patterns.  However, I think it gets boring after few scenes and I fell asleep towards the end, I wouldn't pay $60 something for it.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Sexy lights, sexy european girls and a very intimate place.
French music and expensice liquer ooh la la la la ! The decor alone makes you forget you're in the middle of a seedy casino :)",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I lived in Paris for 3 years, and while working as a Tour Guide for executives I received a lot of perks for restaurants, shows and clubs...Crazy Horse on Avenue George 5 was one of them...I got to actually meet Alain Bernardin, the original founder and owner of Crazy Horse. The show in Paris was a breath taking experience...it was true art, mixed with nude and dance and light and music, even the very burlesque teathre with red velvet chairs and curtains..., for a fusion of overwhelming magic! I always tried to explain to my American husband , what it was like...but is hard to explain something like this without experiencing it...so while in Vegas I saw  reviews for The Crazy Horse...I thought it might be as good!...Well although not quite as good as the original, it was well done! I am still taking my husband to the original in Paris!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"The girls are gorgeous, there is no denying that.  The show was well put together; some skits were better then others.  We had amazing seats in the pit and the interlude performance by the brothers (the name escapes me at the time) was halarious and amazing.

and now for the bad:  Some of the girls in the performance were definitely fill-ins.  I say that because during the show they didn't know the words to the songs they were singing and were about a 1/2 second off with all the moves.  There was about 3 skits where my jaw was dropping.

the service was horrible.  the woman came around once and asked if I wanted a drink, which I did.  I ordered.  she came back about 45 minutes and asked if I wanted a refill.  I informed her that I havent event recieved the first one.  She apologized and said it would be out right away.  I told her to forget it, and the show ended about 10 mins later.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Bought tickets early. Made sure we had good seats. Thought it would be a nice gift for my new husband.  Girls were beautiful. I can appreciate that much. Would have to say the rest leaves a lot to be desired.  Some of the girls just seemed like they weren't into it.  They looked bored.  Glad we saw it, wouldn't go again! One of those ""been there, done that"" kind of shows. Oh well, maybe it just wasn't for me.  I'd rather spend the money and so see one of the Cirque shows (not ""O"").",2
Arts & Entertainment,"So so. There were several parts that dragged. My date grew restless halfway through and walked out for 15 minutes. On the plus side, this show celebrates the female form in an artistic and tasteful way. Light effects were cool, but it got old pretty quickly. The night I went a girl must've called in sick. In one act, there was a line of girls partially covered by swinging doors, and one door was left unaccompanied. It was really distracting that was left unfilled. My eye kept going back to the empty spot. I don't why they didn't have a fill in, or at least move girls over one to fill the void. Overall I found this show entertaining but it would benefit with some changes to the flow. The side shows felt like odd additions. They didn't fit into the theme of the main show, nor did they share any similarities to the show. Anyhow, wouldn't recommend to everyone.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"The most beautiful adult show I have ever seen.....

The girls  were beautiful, the acts were classy, the songs were freaking awsome.

Crazy Girls, Fantasy, X-Burlesque, Bite are not even comparable.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"hands down best Vegas show I have seen.  Beautiful girls, great skits... 2 funny guys also did a couple of skits, one had us practically rolling on the floor.  Nice French music... drinks not too pricey... I will definitely be back to this show next time I am in Vegas!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"One of the best shows in Vegas.  Tasteful and sexy.  Beautiful girls.  Intimate seating.  But still, try to get a good seat - it just gets better.  
Note I was there few years ago, so don't know if it changed much.  But it was so good, I went twice!
Good enough to bring the wife/girl friends.
Should be able to get discounted tickets too.",5
Arts & Entertainment,Oh Ya!!!! The most incredible bodies on the planet. Performance is impeccable and who knew the best pop-locking I've seen in a long time!! What a great surprise! True Cabaret!,5
Arts & Entertainment,"My wife and I attended this club after reading the positive reviews on Yelp. Yes, the performers were amazing to look at, but the entertainment value was sorely lacking. The choreographer missed the boat on this one. The music was painfully loud - to the point of covering your ears at some points. They try to capture the essence of the famous French clubs by piping in old static-y soundtracks and having the dancers lip-synch the French lyrics. It comes across as clumsy and amateurish. 

Although it was fun to see the dancers, the artsiness constantly got in the way of the show... they would project distracting geometric patterns onto the performers with the net result being you couldn't really see much of the performers - that sort of defeats the purpose of the show, doesn't it?

At one point, there was a skit with two guys doing a breakdance/robot sort of routine. My initial reaction was 'What's with the GUYS on the stage?"" but they were awesome and a true highlight of the evening. Again, not what you expect when you take in a show like this. 

The best tip I can share is to NOT pay full-price. Instead, go to the Half-Price night of show ticket stores along the strip. For $30/ticket, it's worth the experience, but I wouldn't be happy if I paid twice that for this mediocre show. Also, keep in mind that drinks are pricey - $9/beer, but the utlra-fine-print on their menus indicates that an 18% tip is already included in that price. I mistakenly tipped on top of that and felt taken.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"The show was very good, it was classy, beautiful, and tasteful.  I would say close to 50% of the audience are couples, contents of the show is not for men only.  I also really liked the music and too bad, they do not sell soundtrack of the show.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Deeply disappointed by this.

The performers were absolutely gorgeous, sure, and it's very nice to see beautiful dancers who aren't...hyper-inflated.  It's a classy show.  But the choreography is just boring and not at all sexy -- seriously, I've seen hotter moments on Dancing With The Stars.  I suppose I had thought that the play of lights on the dancers' bodies would allow for some really interesting and creative dance...but for the most part, it was just some synchronized kicks and bad lip-synching.  I'd rather see some well-choreographed erotic dance with clothes on.

Worse still, we had the misfortune to be there when Carmen Electra was performing with them.  She's a pretty girl, but she's not a great dancer and with her gravity-defying boobs, she just had no business being up on stage with the showgirls.

I wholeheartedly agree with Roland S. -- the Crazy Horse show was a waste of time, other than the really amusing interlude with the break dancers.

Go see Zumanity instead.  I wish I'd just gone to see that again.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"We were expecting a sensual artistic performance.
The performers were all perfect tens and you could tell they were trained dancers. Unfortunately, we found the choreography too monotonous. It was a little ""too artistic"" for my taste. for variety, They had brought in a comedic duo who's act didn't fit into the show at all... Completely agree with the reviews from D.Z. and Roland S.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"This show is classy, sexy, and female-friendly. 
It celebrates the female form, rather then objectifying it like sleazier topless shows. You can bring your boyfriend along and both leave happy. The theater is small and intimate- not a bad seat in the house. The costumes, lighting, and of course the dancers are absolutely beautiful..without having to resort to freaky fake boobies to be sexy. I just wish they sold a soundtrack to the show- the music was awesome, a mix of old and new, yet so modern. We bought tickets at the half price booth under the coke bottle a few hours before the show, and this was a great deal. The drinks inside the show are a little pricey but strong....overall a great experience.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Classy, Sexy, and Fun.

This is the first show I have ever seen in Vegas and I wasn't dissapointed at all. I came to the show with my boyfriend was placed in a great seating. The show was done in tastefull and artistic way that after the first act you don't even notice the nudity. It wasn't such a shocking to see. They sing and dance.One number that they performed was the one with the small doors that swings open and the lighting was pink and they had these short wigs was so cute. I also like a number they did called ""But I am a good girl""..it is now stuck in my head. haha! And I'm still humming it. You can also order drinks here which is a reasonable price.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I let my friend pick this show, because he didn't get a chance to see it in Paris. Ok. its suppose to be classy and tasteful and celebrate the female form. 

The set up was strange, where everyone was sitting at tables, but whatever. The drink I got in my souvenir glass was the highlight of the show. Their popcorn came pre-packaged in a bag. 

I have to say the dancers were lovely, and looked lovely naked, they weren't grinding or acting like they were in a strip club. Ok, its classy i get it. 

Do we really need to listen to french songs? Does the guy in front have to be that drunk and cheer that loudly at everything?

Ok so they have lights that shine onto their bodies. Great. But I'm sorry, I fell asleep twice during this show. Seeing boobies and nekkid bottoms apparently didn't keep me up long enough. I was hoping for something a bit more, rather than a bunch of girls standing and marching in place for their opening number. British soldiers marching, that was loud enough to keep me awake. 

As the show went on, I just fell asleep. It wasn't entertaining for me to keep my interest. I was just glad it was over. sorry it wasn't my cup of tea. not to say the performers weren't talented, they could dance, but yeah the material wasn't good enough. 

apparently the french like this stuff.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I like the small venue and some of the costumes, or lack there of were ok, but the show is too slow paced. I found the two guys with the comedy dance routine in the middle of the show to be the best part, definitely woke me up. I am not knocking these girls, they are pretty and you may seem some beaver, but I found it to lack sexiness. And the part with the woman dancing and only her hips down are showing, was extremely slow, boring, and not all that sexy. And the lady who comes out and dances between scenes isn't that great either. Kind of corny if you ask me, no one eve knows if they should clap for her or not. Most chose not, I think all chose not. The part I did like is that they use colored and shaped lights to project on the women's body, something that a certain DIVA at Encore stole for her show. If you can find a discount ticket, which you can, then go ahead in see this show.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"As others have said, this is very classy and female friendly. This isn't a true ""stripper"" show so don't go expecting raunchy female pole dancers. The music is great and the lighting is truly fantastic. The girls weren't plasticky. Overall, a great experience. Make sure to get discount tickets.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Sexy, entertaining and avant garde. That's how I describe the Crazy Horse Paris Show at MGM Grand. 

Both the theater and stage are small, creating a sense of intimacy and intrigue. The audience sits at tables, and when the dancers perform, their proximity seems very close to you. I swear, there were times when I held eye contact with dancers. It really feels that intimate. 

Drinks are yummy and prices are your typical on-The-Strip prices. But if you order one of their signature drinks, it comes in a souvenir glass you can take home with you. 

Obviously, it's a burlesque show, and it's very classy while remaining sexy and innovative. The women are gorgeous and natural. You won't find any silicone at this show. How refreshing. 

The choreography was entertaining, but the most impressive aspect was the lighting design. I know it sounds like an unusual facet of the show to point out, but I really have to compliment the lighting. It's an integral part of the show.

Honestly, I didn't expect to be that impressed with a burlesque show. But I found it to be more than burlesque. It was very artistic, and I would gladly see it again.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"4.5 stars.

The girls are really f*cking sexy. The show is mostly nude, but done in a very classy, artistic way. After a while I forgot they were naked. The venue (as well as the stage) is small and intimate (appropriate for the show). We had seats at one of the tables in front, but it seemed as though the place was small enough for everyone to get a good view. They did very cool things with the lighting and the costumes (even though they were very tiny) were great. They have brothers that do a couple acts as well. They were very funny and entertaining. Don't worry...the brothers don't get naked ;)",5
Arts & Entertainment,"All the sensuality of a stop-motion Barbie doll parade done by 14 year olds whilst drinking mom's sherry in the basement....but should I tell you what I really think?
The dancers are incredibly fit and most are classically trained dancers. But the Za Za Zu is missing....with one exception. There is a number performed by a dancer writhing all over a red lip couch that is sexy, and kittenish at the same time....
The lip-synch is unneccessary...we all know they are not really singing so why pretend the canned music is anything but....
The male dance team was entertaining.
Then there is the customer service. 
We purchased 6 tickets through our hotel concierge and wanted the very best of seats. We were prepared to go another time and/or pay the top price for those seats. Our concierge was offered ""VIP seating"" which we took....it was then revealed that we could get a discount by going through her. What a bonus! We were offered both price categories but still chose the most expensive of the two. We were given a voucher that clearly stated ""VIP seating"". When my husband went to the box office to redeem and pay for the tickets, he asked where they were on a seating chart but the CSR got side tracked and got around to it.
We had dinner reservations so were planning on coming just before curtain with our group. So time was tight. But when shown to our table at the back and slightly to the side of centre, I was livid! I told the usher that this was not acceptable and was told to go to the box office, but the house lights were going down and the rest of the party just took their seats and didn't want to be disruptive to the rest of the audience. 
I figured I would go to the box office after and complain, but the box office was closed after the performance.
Now I am actively hunting down the box office management and hotel customer relations people to get an explanation.
My hotel concierge is unhappy with them and not inclined to do further recommendations for them. 
So, I perhaps would have been more receptive to the show, had my tickets been what I requested and the usher/house manager been less dismissive. I never make a scene, I never cause trouble, and I deal with things in private, in a respectful, restrained manner. I have been involved with theatre for over 30 years, and have never been so disappointed and discouraged.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"The most artistic burlesque show I've seen in Vegas! 
The woman were incredible performers, well trained. Their moves were so in sync, I thought they were mannequins. Not to mention they are all the same height and body shape. The show was about half an hour, but it didn't drag. 
The night we went Carmen Electra was a guest performer. 

Even my mom thought it was sexy and classy. 
That says something ya'll. 

Great show. Great choreography. In an intimate setting... 
Worth seeing.",4

This one is going to be short and sweet.  I can't believe I had not done a review for this one.

Only 4 stars cause that has become my new 5 star.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"One of the best topless shows I've seen in Vegas. We sat at one of the tables right in front (with the requisite drunk guy a table or 2 over) and had a really good time. The dancing was amazing and all the girls were beautiful. The question came to mind: How do they find so many different girls with the same body type?? 

No silicone in sight and my wife and I both loved the show!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"While we were in Vegas we wanted to see some shows, my wife has been to Paris and was curious about this show (and so was I ). 

Crazy Horse is a delightful Parisian cabaret show, not for the puritanical (you will see plenty of topless women) but if your not offended by that you will be wowed at the dancing, laughing at the comedy, and crying that it was over.

Both my wife and I enjoyed it very much and will be back to see it again next trip to Vegas.",4
Arts & Entertainment,I found the show from yelp reviews and its a fantastic show.  well choreographed and tasteful.  the only issue would be that we sat in the front row.  i would recommend sitting in the second section of the theatre.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"Seriously?!?!  I'm looking at all these 4 and 5 star reviews and wondering if we saw the same show.....  

We headed for a half price tickets stand hoping to get either Jubilee or Terry Fator tickets... we noticed the Crazy Horse tickets were only $30 a piece and we'd all heard good things about it and settled on getting tix.  

We went to the early show, and were shown to our seats - bar style seating when there were heaps of open tables around us.  The place never got more than 1/3 full.  Drinks were pricey, snacks were expensive and a joke, and service was right there where the snacks are - a joke.  Absolutely no excuse when the place was so empty.

We'd all heard that it was burlesque, good reviews, artistic - not just nudity for the sake of nudity.  Um yeah, riigghhtt.....   As soon as the curtains opened it was Tits and Butts on Parade!  Whatever.....  

Some of the ""skits"" made no sense, others went on WAY too long, and the lighting??  Some of it was interesting, but come on!  When there's a topless woman writhing around, practically humping a lips shaped couch and the lighting on her suddenly makes it look like she has as many nipples as my cat if not more?!  Gag....  

Applause was rarely heard thoughout the show.  The two intermission acts, The Scott Brothers and The Quiddlers, received more applause than the girls.  Applause for the girls could be described as polite applause at best.  

I don't know....  maybe we just aren't avant-garde enough to 'get it', but we weren't alone.  Seemed like the majority of people there were in the same boat as us.  And when the two males in your group of 4 are bored to the point of wanting to go hit the slot machines and are glad that we got discount tickets??  I'm just sayin'......  

I'd safely say that the Crazy Horse is a been there, done that, don't need to do it again kind of show.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I'm amazed this show is getting 1-star reviews, because I just went for my second time a couple weeks ago (sans Dita Von Teese) and even without the queen of burlesque, these women deserve all the adoration in the world. 

When you walk into the theater, it is very intimate with plush velvet seating, and you can tell from the decor that you are going to be entertained. It is borderline cheesy, but still seductive.

This show starts off with a bang, with a line-up of all the statuesque beauties almost fully nude in military costume. Then there is a short film that gives a backstage peek and introduction of the ladies while they set up for more skits. There are many little vignettes: some are comedic in nature, some have the ladies singing along to very sassy showtunes, and the rest are just stunningly gorgeous and artistic. There is a bit of an intermission with this pair of men doing well.... two very comedic but odd skits. It just needs to be seen to be understood. 

This show is tediously choreographed, from lighting to music to the dancers themselves. The women are even choreographed where exactly to look in the audience when on stage. It is quite impressive and I did not see one difference at all from the first time I saw them. These dancers are just so talented and very, very beautiful, and 100% natural! I honestly thought I would be a little intimidated by these sultry women with literally perfect bodies (perfect mix of athletic but still womanly and soft - so sexy!) but each time I have seen them it just revved me up and made me feel super flirtatious. Good job, ladies! ;) 

This to me is a must-see show, but you have to have an open mind to appreciate this kind of artistry. Run and get tickets now if you want to see sexy, classy women in Louboutins dancing to some of the most fun music with amazing lighting and costumes (or lack therof!). Also, this is an EXACT replica of the one in Paris! If you're not lucky enough to go there, just head to the Strip to be entertained in every sense of the word. I can't speak more highly of this show, it is a sight to be seen and an experience that has yet to be matched.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I took Jessie B here for her surprise Bday gift. We were both super excited to find they served Framboise Lambic. We ordered a couple and sat back to enjoy the show..which was amazing. All the girls are natural..but on this night the guest of honor was Carmen Electra! And we all know she has been ""enhanced"".
It was a super sexy show. It did not have the flair of an old school review but they managed to stay entertaining.
This is worth the money if you enjoy a sexy adult theme show.",4
Arts & Entertainment,We had just finished seeing Zumanity and wanted to see some more skin. We got to sit in a plush booth in the back. The drink was good and I got a souvenir glass. (though paid a pretty price for it) The show was interesting enough but didnt compare after being wowed by the awesomeness of Zumanity. But we were frisky and had our fun in the secluded booth of the very dark room while the show went on. Had a great memorable time.,4
Arts & Entertainment,"My bf and I went to watch it the night we arrived in vegas. It was ok, he really liked it. What guy wouldnt want to see all most naked girls do sexy moves and lip sing in french? Just the part of them lip singing in french made it sexy. the lighting was cool but messed with my eyes big time. I got bored after 30 mins of the show and couldnt wait for it to be over! Luckly the skits in between were funny and woke me back up expecially the one of Michael jackson. it was super funny.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Very excellent!

Very precise, somewhat mechanical performances, but excellent nonetheless.

Usually topless, incredibly beautiful girls, but can't them apart most of the time as they seem to have been chosen for their identical body types.

Would recommend for couples, people not into lap dances. Also would suggest not sitting in front/lower level, as that is pretty darn close. Second level is perfect. The interior is wall to wall, floor to ceiling red velvet, and kind of cool. Show up early because so do other people, to get the good seats at their tables.

The show itself is pitch-black in the hall, so orders drinks beforehand. Full bar, domestic beers were seven dollars, imports 12 or so. Cocktails in souvenir glass were 17, meh.

Breaking up the show are two comic acts, a Michael Jackson spoof. It's kind of like a puppet show, really. The other is a sort of syncronized ""popping"" routine that is truly wild. Hard to explain, but it'll knock your socks off.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"This was an amazing show. I absolutely loved it. All the girls are natural and between 5""4 to 5""6 height slim body type and breast size no larger than a B cup. The show, lightning and choreography was amazing. Very stunning show. Jane from the jungle had an amazing solo performance that left the audience at awe... I want to go back to see this show and just being me I would definitely bring a date here.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I found my Friday evening in Vegas free without any plans.  I was really interested in seeing a show, but my preferred choices were only available for the next day or a later week.  Talking to my girlfriend, she encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and try a cabaret show.  In Vegas this can be kind of tricky since there is a whole spectrum of activity that can fall under the guise of cabaret.  With her suggestion I sought out the hotel concierge for tickets to a production that would be classy and interesting.  Without hesitation, he recommended Crazy Horse Paris at the MGM Grand casino.  

I never heard of the show before, but apparently it is based on a very popular French revue that is regularly shown in Paris.  Some singing acts have original French numbers and there is supporting video in French as well.  I suppose the show was generally good.  I mean, I found it enjoyable and all.  It was definitely a respectable show.  The only nudity was the universal showing of breasts, and all acts were performed on stage.  There was almost nothing in the way of risquee behavior or innuendo though.  It was more like seeing the Rockettes topless.  The mix of uniforms and music made the performance consistently interesting, but there was never any wow factor.  The quality of the choreography and the costumes was consistent with a Broadway production though.  Further, the whole routine was broken up by two other short acts which were unusual and very entertaining.  I'm not sure if the full ticket price of $68 is easy to justify, but apparently, based on other reviews, people have garnered tickets for quite a bit less, so be on the lookout.

Also, drink and food service is available before the show.  Food is misleading though since that is only a mix of pre-packaged snacks like popcorn and chips, i.e., there is no prepared food to order.  The drinks were varied though with the list including specialty cocktails, wines by the glass, and a nice mix of beer.  I was able to get a full size blue label Chimay for $19 which was not too terrible of a value.  They even had Duvel on the list.  

Overall, 4 stars because I did enjoy myself.  I hesitate with the rating though, because I would not likely choose to see this show again.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I have never seen a burlesque show before in Vegas or anywhere really.  So with Crazy Horse Paris, I approached it with no expectations and an open mind.  And in the end, I thought it was great show!

The women here were really beautiful, nicely sculpted, and very talented performers.  I loved how each vignette was produced to look like you were looking at a moving painting with the artistic lighting ""painted"" onto the ladies.  That was some definite eye-candy. 

Along with the women, they had two side acts as well.  The Popping dancers were really cool and the ""Short"" Tribute to Michael Jackson was really entertaining.  They were both a nice comedic change of pace from the burlesque dancers

I highly suggest to pick up the $32 tickets at Tix4Tonight to get more bang for your buck.  But if you don't have time to stop by at one, I think it would still be worth the $54 tickets.  If you have about 90 mins to spare in Vegas at night, go see this show!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Ho hum. Sure the girls were hot, but after about the third act or so I zoned out and started thinking about my post-show plans rather than the T&A bouncing around on the stage. Starting the show with a film clip gave the rest of the performances an illusory feel that I didn't enjoy, contrary to the other Yelp reviews I found the Michael Jackson act cheap and lame, and I've seen better ""popping"" on the street. Should've shelled out the extra $$ for Jubilee instead.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I don't know? I want to like this more, but I just don't. 

Yes, the woman in this show have beautiful bodies, but I just found the whole show kind of strange. Weird songs, and lip singing, and what is w/those wigs? We were right in front of the stage, and the tiny table and uncomfortable chairs didn't help. 

I just didn't get it.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"If you like the Playboy kind of woman, you won't find these girls attractive. They are great dancers, and have fit bodies, but no breasts. If you are into asses and legs, then you will like this show. I didn't find the women very pretty. There was some nice dancing acts though. I dont like that they cover their hair with syncronized swimmer types of hats. The colored wig skit was nice. But, I don't think the show was worth $121 for two people. I had more fun at the Playboy club and saw better looking girls, although they weren't topless.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"The ladies are both talented dancers (a pleasant surprise) and lovely to look at.  Some of the numbers were just too silly to enjoy but there were a handful that were amazing.  The new 19-year old they are making such a big deal of because she was a playboy centerfold was one of the weakest points - she's not much of a dancer so her pieces are meant to showcase how hot she is rolling around on stuff.  She IS cute - but those pieces were a total yawner.    My biggest complaint is actually about the facility.  HORRID seating (the chairs are about a 1/2 inch from each other - no leg room at all) and MGM clearly wants to gouge the heck out of you.   A plain old iced tea was $5 and beer started at something like $8 for a bottle of Bud.   Don't believe them when they tell you that you need to get there early - they just want you to get thirsty enough for an $8 Bud to make sense.  If you can get discount tickets, there are certainly worse ways to spend time in Vegas.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Free tix for being on the winning team of the Yelpmazing race!!

This was such a breath of fresh air after seeing SO MANY crappy shows recently.  I really didn't know what to expect going in but the mix of the gorgeous women (all natural to boot!), awesome lighting/visuals and music really transported me to another place.  I enjoyed every single minute.

A few of the scenes really stood out including ""Upside down"", ""Baby Buns"" and any scene with all 15 girls on stage.  I used to think being in the first 3 rows for ""O"" was sensory overload..but THIS was maximum sensory overload.

The 2 acts that performed in between the girls' shows were also great.  One was 2 guys doing a pretty incredible dance performance..kinda like Jabbawockeez unmasked and the other was a crazy Michael Jackson tribute w/ ""short"" people.  Really funny and entertaining.  

My only recommendation would be to show up as soon as the doors open to get the best seat possible.  The tables in the 2nd and 3rd sections aren't really assigned seating.  Ushers are also receptive to $10 handshakes for improved viewing.  

I'm definitely going to take some of my out of town friends to this show in the future and will be getting VIP section next time.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I'm not a gambling person, a club person or a shopping person, so I was pretty limited in my options of things I'd actually like to do in Vegas. Since we wanted to save money, my boyfriend and I were choosing between either going to Zumanity or Crazy Horse Paris (both of which were available through Tix 4 Tonight at a discounted rate). Zumanity had some weird reviews so we decided to go here instead. The theater itself is very intimate and no seat is bad, so I'm glad I opted for the 2nd tier cheaper seating.. I think I would have been a bit more uncomfortable in the first few rows at eye level with the stage, considering this was my first cabaret/burlesque show.

Drinks were kind of expensive inside, so I'm glad I had some jello shots and drinks around the corner from the theater within the MGM grand. I did end up ordering a Champagne cocktail inside and got to take home the cute tall glass they served it in as a memento. The performers were really good and the best performance was definitely one of the ones toward the end where you never see the girls face at all. The Michael Jackson/breakdancing act in the middle was a bit awkward though and like other reviewers, I thought it seemed out of place. I think I'd come here again depending on if any celebrity joined the cast temporarily. 

One thing I didn't like was waiting for the show to start outside in the MGM grand casino area-- this casino has such low ceilings and definitely reeks of more smoke than most places because of it.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"One word...BORING! If you are a young male or a young couple, I would NOT recommend this. If you're coming to see a topless show, there is nothing to see. The people all looked the same. When my girlfriend and I  first got there, they put us in seats that we couldn't even see the stage. Rather then move us to similar seats elsewhere that were obviously open, the option they gave us was to move further back. Overall, I would definitely not recommended this show. I've been to the topless show in Luxor and that was way better. They even had a comedian who came as an interlude that was actually funny. The best part of this show was the interlude with two guys dancing like robots.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"When I booked this show, I knew what to expect since I've seen the Moulin Rouge show in Paris (small venue, up close to stage, the singing, dancing etc). I knew this would be a little different since it's suppose to be more erotic and sexy vs the Moulin Rouge, which is probably similar to Jubilee. 

I liked the intimacy and the feel of this show. Being right in front of the stage. All the girls were beautiful and were near identical in body shape and chest/ass size. It's very artistic too with the lights because it's sensual and you can't really get this kind of show elsewhere. 

We definitely enjoyed this show and the two side shows were just hilarious and pretty cool.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"This show isn't for everyone, but for those who love beautiful dancers, plush hot pink decor, and avant-garde lighting, this may be the show for you. Be prepared for creepy old men who come for the sole purpose of gawking at naked ladies. It's a great place to bring a date if you want to get in the mood. There is a lot of nudity so if that makes you uncomfortable, go elsewhere.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I am so surprised that other people gave this show bad reviews.  

First off the dancers are amazing, they are dancers who were classically trained doing burlesque style numbers.  They are all very beautiful and talented.  Don't expect these women to have huge breasts and look plastic because they don't.  I heard that none of the women in the show are allowed to get plastic surgery.

The numbers were great.  They did a lot of neat things with the lighting so sometimes you forgot you were looking at real people.  Everything was tastefully done, I took my parents and did not feel awkward to sit next to them.  Overall, I would attend the show again. .


The theater is more of a lounge type setting, with small cocktail tables and booths lined up along the back.  You want to make sure you get there early because you aren't assigned exact seats.  Seats are first come first serve within your section. 

SERVICE: TERRIBLE!  I wanted to order a drink and was told at the beginning of the show my waitress would be back.. 10 minutes before the show ended she came to see if I wanted anything.  This was after she served people in front of us and right next to us.  I was honestly shocked that the service could be so terrible.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I liked this show.  The stage is small and the ambiance is sexy in the Crazy Horse Theater.  The girls are pretty, in shape, and all except one had natural breasts.  

I went and saw this show with my husband and two of our friends.  We all agreed that this was one of the better topless shows on the strip.  The show was entertaining, and the girls were amazingly in sync...you can tell they've rehearsed and they dance as a team.

They also did cool effects with both the choreography and the lighting.  I don't think I would see this show a second time, although I would definitely recommend that you at least head over and see it once.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Sure you get to see some ( . Y . ), but all they did was dance. I could have gone to a strip club and pretty much have seen the same thing, but only cheaper and see some full frontal nudity.

There were no themes. The stage was small and their heads almost hit the ceiling. This ain't no Moulin Rouge. I actually did enjoy Moulin Rouge. Click here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/moulin-rouge-paris#hrid:QoQl64Y1GSvn9H_tn5sVYg. But over here at the Crazy Horse at the MGM, there were no acrobats, no jumping or flying or extravagance in entertainment.

I fell asleep pretty much throughout most of the show, either due to boredom or maybe I was drunk. Either way, I still did manage to see some of the show and still I wasn't entertained. Somehow, when the performers look at the audience, it just seems they are staring at you. I don't know how they do it, but it's weird, wherever you are sitting, they are literally staring at you. Pretty cool, yet pretty freaky.

I did like the intermission when two male performers were dancing in sync. Pretty funny acts, and pretty cool stunts and dance show. 

But other than that, the performances by the rest of the cast was mediocre at best, just a cleaner version of a strip club. The only difference is that I paid $69 to get in, and I fell asleep. But at least I don't have that lingering stripper smell. 

I don't know; if you haven't seen a show like this, then yah, it's worth going out to see it at least once. For $69 (or less if you find some really good deals), it's still pretty cheap compared to the other shows in Vegas. I also got half bottle of the champagne for $43. I think the champagne helped me get through this 1 hour and 15 minute show.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Classy, topless revue....

Dancing pretty women with their perfect au natural boobies and bodies!   No stripper poles, fake ta ta's, or vijay juice around this place. 

This show is modeled after the Crazy Horse Cabaret from Paris so the music and lip synching is in French.  Small, intimate lounge setting with a tiny stage.  Probably to give the illusion the girls are super tall when they are between 5'4-5'6.  You may be sitting at your own table or sharing one with other viewers like we did.  If you want water, I'd recommend not buying bottled water here.  Bottle of a small fiji water was 10 bucks!!  Rip off!!  Bring a big purse and sneak one in!   $43 bucks for a bottle of champagne (thanks Mike!!!) . I thought it was yucky but Mauricio L and Mike C liked it enough.

Besides Jubilee at Bally's, Crazy Horse is the only other topless show I""ve been to so I don't have much to compare it to.  For what it was, I enjoyed it enough.  The show is broken down into little segments with a title/theme.  Crazy lights and music added to the shows. For example one was a strip tease, another was all about the women's perfect butts, and another was a routine with chairs.  There was also this segment with two guys doing some sort of pop and lock act.

We ended paying for the regular 70 dollars for this show because it was a last minute decision.  I'd recommend trying to get the discounted tickets if you can ($55?), I think this show would be more worth that. I'd rather spend more money on Cirque shows.  But this show or Jubilee at Bally's does the job if you want to check out a classy, topless revue.  I wouldn't see this again but I think it's worth seeing at least once.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I'd love to give this 5 stars.  But, the performances were a little inconsistent.

Pros:  Gorgeous women.  Fantastic music (I want the soundtrack).  Fun atmosphere and decor.  French burlesque theme.  Great lighting techniques.  Two of the funniest intermissions.  

Cons:  Tiny stage with a low ceiling.  The performers deserve better.  They almost seemed hindered by the stage.  Uncomfortable chairs.  Hit and miss lip synching.  

Bad cocktail waitress.  I ordered the lambic framboise and my wife ordered the lambic peche.  She didn't know what they were.  We had to show her the menu.  Mind you the menu is only two 4X5 cards.  The people behind us asked if the Duvel was a dark or light ale.  She just stared at them blankly, so we explained it to them.  When you're a cocktail waitress and only have to memorize 12 beers, you have no excuses for bad service.

Despite this nit picking, it was a great time and I'd go again.  And, I'm sure the waitress will either learn about beers or get fired by then.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Excellent show!! If you have a military ID you can get a solid discount.

The ladies were beautiful and were very in sync with each other. There were 2 guys that did a bit that I was hesitant about at first but their performance was most impressive. Overall, very happy. The ""chain gang"" dance was the only one i felt was quite weak.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"The women were all very attractive, if only it were possible to see them.  Nearly every act was in near complete darkness with one light source, but even that was filtered with patterns and stripes, essentially breaking up every lady's lines with camouflage.  In the end, is that not what's actually sexy?

The production ruined any potential talent.  You're paying to see a light show to cheesy music.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"MMMMMMM Mama likes!

This show is different in a great way! Sexy, classy, tasteful, artistic, abstract, erotic, clever, and interesting!

This is an arousal show great for couples, maybe even a first date depending on how naughty you are or want to be. Frisky Frisky!

Gorgeous lean tall bodies, if you are a leg man or woman, this is a treat for you enough said! Gams galore!

This is a small cabaret style showroom with red velvet walls, seats and booths it is dark intimate and sexy with a small personal up close stage. 
I felt sexy just walking in.

Booze up on your liquor of choice if neccessary before walking in. A small bottle of Evian water was $10 bucks, I did not look any further after seeing a bottle of wine listed for $250.00.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Fantastic! Very classy and well done burlesque performance! I was quite impressed with all elements of this production. The dancers were cast well, all having similar body types.  The dancers were very talented and the numbers were very clean. At moments I felt like I was watching a burlesque version of the Rockettes. The choreography and staging was great. The lighting and costumes were well correlated bringing a VERY sexy show without the raunch that leaves audience members feeling like they are in a strip club like some other shows do.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who appreciates true Burlesque!",5
Arts & Entertainment,An incredibly artistic and entertaining celebration of the female form. It never ceases to keep your attention as these amazing dancers perform wondrous motions and movements. This is worth any opportunity to see and can be honestly enjoyed by women or men.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"We came here to celebrate my friends bachelor party.  Between taking secret shots of tequila by myself, (I don't remember) and riding in a limousine (I have video but I dont remember) losing my credit card (I don't remember) and getting sick (I don't remember) winning 100$ on blackjack ( I don't remember) and spending lots of money ( I don't remember), we managed to squeeze in a show.  At around 20-30 dollars, this is a great show, especially for a bachelor party.  You could go to a strip joint, but if you want to make it a classy sort of thing that is artistic and visually just a damn cool show that you can bring your girlfriend to, then this is the place.  The drinks are very, very expensive but tasty and you get a souvenir glass.  I would highly recommend this place as a good way to spend one night.  Also, this has a long history originating in Paris, which means that you can feel pretentious about going there.  For the price ""woohoo! As good as it gets!""",5
Arts & Entertainment,Show was classy. Girls were very beautiful but way too lookalike. Drinks were expensive. One of the intermissions were annoying. Good show to see once. Only worth it if you can get discounted tickets.,3
Arts & Entertainment,"I learned about Crazy Horse Paris as a cabaret originally conceptualized and performed in Paris, way back when I still have to hide contraband copies of Playboy from my parents. I never thought I would be able to experience the show without having to travel to Paris.  But I am glad that the renowned Parisian Theater of the Nude in Action was eventually exported overseas to countries like the USA and even Singapore.

The cabaret is a must see for Las Vegas locals and visitors seeking a sexy, sensual, erotic, classy, artistic and beautifully choreographed show featuring trained dancers that all have perfect bodies and no visible tattoos and piercings.

The Crazy Horse woman truly is the incarnation of the contemporary ideal of beauty, and being able to see 15 of them on stage performing as a group is like seeing the Three Graces x5 dancing in well synchronized routines.  

Some of my favorite scenes are: God Save The Bareskin, which kicks off the show, where all the dancers are dressed as the guards of Buckingham Palace, if they were staffed by very attractive topless female soldiers.  I guess I have a thing for women in uniforms :)

The Upside Down scene features 3 dancers performing with a stage-length mirror, which gives the illusion of them seductively emerging from a pool of water.  

Chair Me Up, a classic 1930s cabaret number, features 3 dancers on 3 Thonet bentwood chairs, transformed with modern music and geometric light patterns projected on stage.

You Turn Me On - which features all the dancers in a spectacle of femininity, voluptuousness, and flirtiness is the burlesque finale that energetically concludes the show.

There are additional scenes which I enjoyed, but could not recalled the name.  There are also two performances that features no supermodels, which the audience enjoyed once they got over the initial reaction of seeing dudes on stage.  The performance by the Scott Bros, was very cool and weird (kind of like Jabbawockeez unmasked as Philip T mentioned in his review).

Overall, it was a great show and very popular as indicated by how full the small theater was on a Wednesday night.  If you intend to watch Crazy Horse Paris, definitely go and line up early for best seating.  As tickets in sections 2 and higher are assigned to rows, so the seats closer to the stage are filled on a first come first serve basis.",4
Arts & Entertainment,Good show! Very classy and sexy. I'd watch it again.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"I wish I'd gotten to see Claire SinClaire when she performed in Crazy Horse (total girl crush!) 

We saw Crazy Horse a year ago. Small, intimate theater. The women are in amazing shape and are mesmerizing to watch. Some of the numbers are better than others, but the woman in the cage was what captured my attention. Extremely erotic and powerful performance. 

We got 50% tickets at the discount ticket booth outside of the MGM Grand. Definitely worth it if you get the tix at a discount.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Good things: 1) Group numbers 2) Scott Bros 

Not so great: 1) Lip Syncing 2) Solo Performances (mainly b/c lip sync'd) 3) Not very sensual, the music was fast, and the choreography was...m-yeh... 3) Drink Service disorganized.

This was our first show. Maybe they're not supposed to be sexy? I mean yes - there were boobies, and garters, and innuendo....but...it came off a bit cheesy. I can understand breaking it up so everyone doesn't get too randy, but I thought the whole point was to...I don't know...get us in the mood? There were good points, but I have to say we were left bored and disappointed. I can't blame the girls. They're all quite good. I think in the end it's sticking too close to the script (why not re-engineer it, maybe the group numbers could reference the original show and the solo's could be based on the MGM theme, I'm thinking Gypsy Rose...). The potential is there for a wonderful, magical, sensual experience...but somehow it didn't quite come together. And when there's lip syncing and people miss the words....well that about says everything. Clothes on or off. I mean it's vegas they can't find people who can sing AND dance?? C'mon!",3
Arts & Entertainment,"First - have accurate expectations. 

Are you looking for girls girating on poles that will let you stick a bill in their g-string? This is not the place for that. 

Are you looking to be awed and amazed by feats of acrobatic dexterity? Check out a Cirque du Soleil show. 

Are you looking for a more artistic/classier version of a strip show? Than this may suit your needs. 

Are you looking for something on the sexy ends of things that you are more likely to enjoy as a woman or as a couple involving a woman? This is definitely a excellent choice. 

Crazy Horse Paris is a set of beautiful, natural looking women who pose, dance, and move to various bits of music under various types of lighting where variations of nothing and next-to-nothing. There are no poles, no girating, no dancing in mid-air on a bolt of silk, no synchronized swimming - just pretty girls, nearly nude, being pretty. 

Compared to Zumanity - this show is really only 3 stars. But it got a star bump for being half the cost of Zumanity. Tickets are typically $50-70 rather than $110+. If you want something to put an extra sexy edge into your evening with your partner, this is not a bad after dinner treat to set the mood for heading up to your room.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"creative, fun, unexpected and sexy! genius use of lights and routine made the whole show fantastically surreal in a more intimate setting. some parts were like a high-end perfume ad--in a good way! although they are barely dressed, it felt artistic rather than pornographic.  definitely recommended.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"These girls are goddesses!

They all clearly have dance backgrounds and perform amazingly!

The girls on the revolving ring did some insane stuff, it was spectacular.

If you're looking for a show that brings home the good old days of true burlesque, then this show is for you. No trashy strippers half-performing their routines here.",4
Arts & Entertainment,Fun show!,5
Arts & Entertainment,"This show is a must see!

My boyfriend and I went to Vegas for his birthday to celebrate. We decided on the Crazy Horse Paris show because not only is the price so reasonable it's really a great show.

These girls are amazing and mesmerizing to watch. I really think anyone can enjoy this show, everything is very tastefully and creatively done. 

The theater itself is small but intimate. If you can, get one of the tables in the front lower section. Beware of flying bananas!",5
Arts & Entertainment,Absolutely marvelous. Simply well done and well rehearsed. Luscious playful eroticism at its best. Highly recommended.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"Not a fan.

The performers were beautiful, sexy, and did the very best they could. I loved some of the lighting and stage effects, but th choreography was boring boring boring BORING. The ONLY acts I enjoyed, were the two ballerinas in the spinning hoop and the pop-n-lock ""filler"" gentlemen. the former were obviously classically trained and their technique was remarkable. The latter were entertaining, well rehearsed, and had fun and engaging choreography.

The drinks are super expensive ($9 for a small Sapporo) and the waitress came by only once at the beginning of the show and never came back throughout the 2 hour show. Really?! The drinks were expensive but that didn't mean I didn't want more than one! Fail.

The theater is super intimate, and it was only half full but it was off-season.",2
Arts & Entertainment,Boring.......only like the one with prison bars props,1
Arts & Entertainment,"Went there in Dec before X'mas and it was pretty good exotic show compared to the over-hyped ""jubilee"".  I fell asleep during Jubilee, partially because of the EST time difference and partially for being bored.  Anyway, wife did some research online and we went to this show unprepared.  So we got the half off tickets from the tix4less stand.  Don't know about others' experience, but the seats we got were pretty bad if not the worst.  They were to the very right side and in the very back (just in front of the sofa).  Despite all the ticket sales pitch about how small the theater was and how seating would not matter, we found that seating in the back gave you nothing.  I could barely see the dancers on stage let alone any details.  And for this show specifically, the lighting effect would cause you vision even worse if you sit too far away.  So I'd suggest you go ahead get a better seat in the front.

I wouldn't give out spoiler but the show girls in this show were way hotter than Jubilee's.  That's all. Your call.",4
Arts & Entertainment,I was expecting something different. Really not that good. The best part were the two guys doing the pop and lock dances.,1
Arts & Entertainment,"I loved this show!  I'm a big fan of burlesque, cabaret, etc.  This was a great topless show.  Classy, sensual, erotic, but not trashy in the least.  The numbers were great, some better than others.  Loved legs!  The soundtrack was super cute and loved the French inspired songs.  The girls were gorgeous, talented, and overall it was just a really well done production.  

Only complaint is how the theatre is set up.  I think it would have been better if everything was round tables, not so close together, and if the stage was slightly bigger.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Visited my boyfriend's cousins in Las Vegas and we saw this show.  We enjoyed it a lot.  Alcohol drink prices were okay but $9 for a bottle of Fiji water? After the show, we were waiting for my car from the valet and they were giving out FREE Fiji water. I bought mine at my local Stater Bros on sale for .99 plus tax in California. (Reason why we bought one water was because my boyfriend's cousin's fiance is pregnant).

The women in the show are beautiful.  Definitely a lot of legs and a lot of nice, perky breasts.  Bf and I don't go out much since he works all day and there's no way I'm going to see titties without him so this was a treat for us.

The boys had 2 each of double shot margarita comes in souvenir cup= $22 each
I had a pineapple upside down cake martini= $14 each
Fiji water= $9 each",4
Arts & Entertainment,"How is it that gorgeous women, all extremely talented dancers, can perform almost completely naked and not titillate the audience? During this entire show, the audience never did more than tepidly clap. I looked at my watch a few times, and if it hadn't been for the two comedic interludes, I might have left early. I was so bored. And I don't think it was just because I'm a straight woman. There was something blasé about seeing carbon-copy little-boobed Barbies dancing with more precision than passion. They were beautiful, but the show was so uptight! I felt like I was watching a performance art piece that just happened to be nude sometimes. Other times, it was flirty and innocent, while naked. The theater was very nice, though.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"This show was so unique! I really preferred this type of a show vs. the flashy Cirque shows (minus absinthe which was amazing as well). The women in this show were all the same in size and I think that's such a cool thing that they managed to make the show so in sync. It was very sensual but tasteful. I liked the way that the theater was sort of small and intimate so that you could really take in the performance up close no matter where you sat. Every seat is a good seat. I'm sure the show changes rather frequently but the one that I saw I really enjoyed. It reminded me of something from the 60's. My favorite performance was the one to the song ""toxic"" and there were a few others that I swore I would remember the names to write on yelp but of course cannot remember now! Any-who, this is a must see in Vegas for the tastefully sexy crowd. 

** FYI it is topless so don't bring someone that you would feel uncomfortable watching the show with.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I loved this show!

I'd been wanting to see it for some time, so I took my boyfriend (what a great girlfriend, huh!) to see it, with some friends. 

We got front seat tickets, so the view was really good. The show was unique, the girls were gorgeous and very apt at dancing and gymnastics. It gave it a sense of class, and not smut. The music and (what little clothes they had on) costumes were cute. The Robotic dancers and Michael Jackson skits were hilarious!

Only con? A cocktail and a beer were $24, but the drink (peach something) was SO good...I should have taken the glass it came in...

In short, if you're not looking for whores in a g-string, dancing on a pole, burlesque and vodeville fans should definitely check it out!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Great show, tastefully done, beautiful girls with authentic bodies. If you come here expecting D sizes cups, walk yourself out the door and go to another show. I was told by others this is the best and classiest cabret show. I would say this is the new cabaret show for vegas. No large feathers and funny suits needed!

Very simple stage set up, nice use of lighting

I purchased tickets  a couple of days before via vegas.com (I think the offer a better price, but don't quote me on that) and got front row seats

please be aware you must pick up tickets an hour before the show starts. They also have a 2 drink minimum and they are pricey",5
Arts & Entertainment,"still a great show, they have changed it up a little bit.  We saw it twice this time!  Highly recommended.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"As so many reviewers have said, this is a sensual, classy show. The dancers are all gorgeous, lean, and talented. A few of the acts are good old-fashioned squirm in your seat with sensual build-up cabaret style, which were the best in my opinion. I expected a bit more out of the choreography, knowing all the dancers were classically trained, but the whimsical parisian cabaret style was entertaining and sexy. certainly a great show for the price, but as noted, the drink prices were outrageous. I didn't notice a drink minimum as noted by another reviewer, though.",4
Arts & Entertainment,interesting,3
Arts & Entertainment,"As a woman attending her first burlesque show, Crazy Horse Paris is a perfect choice. You can tell by the eclectic crowd - we were surrounded by older couples and young men getting drunk and catcalling. It was beautifully done. The women are beautiful and talented. The music is very fun too! I would definitely go again.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"!!! I have never been to a burlesque show before. Wow. This was great. The women were absolutely beautiful and danced extremely well. The seating was very intimate. The music was good too. I really can't think of anything to complain about. Even the guys that did the pop-locking routine halfway through the show were entertaining. The show was very tastefully done, I didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. My girlfriend enjoyed the show just as much as I did. We got lucky, the playmate of the year Claire Sinclair performed with the cast, which was incredible. I am definitely going to see this show again.",5
Arts & Entertainment,TERRIBLE....ASKED FOR OUR MONEY BACK.....Since we bought the tickets at half price tickets we couldn't get our money back but they did give us our money back for our drinks.....BORING.....Don't waste your time,1
Arts & Entertainment,"Not sure how the seating system works but when we got here, they tried sticking us off to the far right which didn't even have a good view of the stage. We had to go back up to the front to see if we could be moved and fortunately, they were able to accommodate. 

The show was overall entertaining. I have to admit there were parts where I dozed off as I felt it became monotonous ( I was also battling a virus). I wasn't a big fan of the solos as I was with the group numbers (opening, buns, etc.). There were breaks that had male performers which didn't seem to really jive with the overall mood of the show (but even then, they were crowd pleasers).

I'm not a big fan of the seating structure as you are screwed if you are sitting directly behind someone who is heavy set or has a big head. We had that scenario the night that we went and it definitely ruined part of the experience.

All in all, I enjoyed the show!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I saw Crazy Horse Paris several years ago and really enjoyed the show.  It was sexy, classy, and very entertaining.

Now that it's closing at MGM in the next week, I needed to go see it again before it's gone.  There was only a minor difference in the two shows I saw.  The one number I really didn't care for was the jailhouse dance.  It seemed interminable and was not that good.  The magician was OK as an interlude, but the three guys who did the ""short leg"" dancing were a hoot!

I really like Upside Down and Chair Me Up.  These are cleverly choreographed and artfully done.

I am sorry this show is closing but I'm glad I had the chance to enjoy it twice.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Sexy Frenchies dancing on a small stage in an intimate French theme theater. I'm glad to have watched this show before it was taken off, everything about this show from the ticket booth, to the entrance and theater design was just a fun experience. They seat you very close to other guests and would take pictures like they would in any other show. The show is about admiring the female body and is very tantalizing almost like strip tease and not to mention topless!

Restaurants,"Get ready for a one-of-a-kind dining experience. Bak'd isn't an everyday kind of place, but perfect for a birthday, anniversary, or uber-impressive first date. Set in downtown Mesa (yes, Mesa), Bak'd has a beautiful, intimate dining room featuring leather couches, low lighting, and shag area rugs. 

The concept here is unique -- you call in advance (at least 24 hours) with your dining preferences, food allergies, and choices from the basic entree items, such as filet mignon, chicken, swordfish, veal or rack of lamb.

Then, based on the information you give them, Chef Timothy and Chef James create a custom 5 to 7 course gourmet meal. The food is delicious, artfully presented, and the chefs are a kick. They look more like bouncers than gourmet chefs, but give them a try. At $40 per person, this private dining experience is worth it.",5
Restaurants,"We went by this place a hundred times, and always commented on the fact that we should go there. We went on Valentines 2007 for the first time. We have been there twice since. The restaurant has gone above and beyond our expectations every time. I am a bit of a picky eater, I will eat ANYTHING they serve.

Bakd is run by a catering company, they use the restaurant to try out new ideas on their patrons. You must make reservations ahead of time, I have always spoken to Chef Tim when doing this, he has always been nice and accommodating even when changing reservations multiple times.

Depending on how many reservations they have they will ask what protein you would like, or just tell you. =) (they are always accommodating of  vegan and vegetarian diets)

Typically they will serve 5 - 7 courses and the chef will come out and explain the dish and his thought process in creating the dish. We have always felt apart of the process. Never has a single course been bad. We have stolen several of their ideas and used them in our own kitchen. The chefs are open to discuss where they shop, what they look for. 

This is by far the most compelling, unique, exciting, wonderful, and amazing dining experience I have ever had.

I encourage everyone I know who enjoys food to go there. 
The store front is small and intimate, it does not feel like being in downtown Mesa at all. 

The price is $45 a person, and well worth it. I do not normally pay this much for a meal, but this is no normal meal! 

Please go and enjoy this is to good not to be packed every night.",5
Restaurants,"Bak'd appears to have closed it's doors as a restaurant.

Have been many times before, and have always had great food and service.  We tried to make a reservation for next week and were informed of the sad news.  They only do catering now.",4
Restaurants,Have been there twice!  Dinner there is great and the service is amazing! You have to make reservations to eat here. Thanks Chef Tim & Rocky!,5
Restaurants,Count your change or if using a debit/credit card be sure to ask for the receipt. I was overcharged by $5 but didn't realize it until I checked my bank records. And with no receipt I can't prove it.,1
Restaurants,I don't think I ever been to one worst customer service and ripping me off and getting my order right I don't think this is a place worth coming to...,1
Restaurants,I have been here several times and they are consistently great! Even when we add or take away items on the burger they always get it right!,5
Local Flavor,"Oh Wickenburg, I enjoy your restaurants and your convenience when I drive to/from Vegas.  You're a welcome respite from the heat and doldrums of a long drive.  However, I do not enjoy the 35 mph zones and speed traps.  Any chance to build a real highway through or around town?  

Return Factor - 60%",3
Local Flavor,"This is a small Arizona cow town serving partly as a watering hole for the Phoenix-to-Las Vegas crowd, along with the local ranchers, etc. Local shopping supplies basic needs, but anything else means a 60+ mile round trip to the northern Phoenix area for a Costco, Walmart, Home Depot, shopping centers, or the like.  Of course, this is less burdensome now in the days of online shopping, where you can get almost anything delivered right to your door, often with no tax or shipping.
It seems quiet, unhurried, with a walkable downtown area. The clear days are really nice, absent the Phoenix area dust-smog haze. it has a smattering of restaurants of the ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"" (Food network show) category. No haute cuisine here. 
There are a few low-key local attractions, such as the cowboy museum and the Hassayampa River preserve where you can see water and green vegetation, in case you forgot what that looked like.  There are a few interesting drives in the local countryside, with curvy roads, hills and vegetation.
All in all, this is a nice friendly place to stay and even live, if you are compatible with the conservative culture, the cowboy ambiance, and the lack of a local KFC or Dunkin Donuts (remember the 60+ mile round trip remark earlier?).",3
Local Flavor,"I do love Wickenburg.  So sad the new freeway passes it but that now adds to the charm that is Wickenburg.  Nestled on the banks of the Hassayampa and preserve it is an oasis of greenery amidst the other desert scrub.  The downtown area is adorable - exactly what you would imagine a ""western"" town to be.  It has a smattering of high dollar homes as well as middle class homes, retiree double-wides and some places that need help.  It is an All-American town with a Wild West flair.  It is a clean town and all those I have encountered there have been very friendly.  It has perfect climate - not too hot in the summer nor cold in the winter.  The cottonwood trees make sure there is beautiful fall foliage as well.  It is perfect and it has always been my dream to be able to retire to a place in Wickenburg and open up a yoga studio.",5
Restaurants,"Best place to have your taxi cab driver or DD drive through to pick up monster tacos and an oreo shake that you will greatly enjoy while still inebriated, but completely regret the next morning! Yeah, buddy!",5
Restaurants,"Got the chicken fajita pita, curly fries and two tacos... Food is always awesome, but not the healthiest... - 1 star for slow service.",4
Restaurants,"What a perfect business! Depending on the time of day, this Jack-In-the-Box will be hosting a steady stream of Cocopah Middle Schoolers, or a crowd of Chaparral High School students or a parade of young adults sobering up from a night of partying. And let's not forget Jack's core target demographic, the late night stoner suffering from the munchies. 

That's what a diverse snack-oriented menu, a dining room open until midnight and a drive-thru open 24 hours a day, will do for you. And it doesn't hurt that most of the workers here are very friendly.",4
Restaurants,"This restaurant advertises itself as being open 24 hours a day. Yet I've been through twice in the early AM (~4AM - 4:30AM), only to be told that their systems were being rebooted and they couldn't take my order.    No provisions for taking an order the old fashioned way -- just flat out ""we can't take your order"".

You're either open 24 hours or you're not.  Don't advertise something you can't deliver on.",1
Restaurants,"I stopped at Jack In The Box on Shea Boulevard in Scottsdale Road tonight ask for four of the two for $0.99 tacos extra crunchy so that way I knew they would be hot and fresh well I got the sack drove off went to grab one and two of them were halfway out of the package in the bag . And they were cold.  the meat was not hot, cheese not fully melted completely and they were packed full of lettuce the worst Jack in the Box tacos I've ever had",1
Restaurants,"Layalena is a real nice spot to come and smoke hookah and relax. My girlfriend and I used to come here on a regular basis about 6-7 months ago. They have a pretty nice selection of shisha. We always end up going back to the rose flavor though. The hookahs they have to smoke out of are very nice and easy to pull through. There is usually someone there who's job is to keep the coals burning on your hookah. 

I've only had hummus here as far as food goes, but it was pretty good. We received a decent sized plate for the price and lots of warm soft pita bread to go with it. I usually get drinks here. They're a little overpriced, but they have a nice selection of top shelf liquor, and the pours have always been more than stiff. 

The three star review is because the last two times we've been in, the service seems to have gone down hill a little and it seems like the Scottsdale bug is starting to bite this little spot. Hopefully things are improved next time we go in",3
Restaurants,"Because Layalena is the closest and most centrally located hookah bar between me and my best gal, we meet up here about once or twice a month. Like all other valley hookah bars, poor Layalena has been reduced to forcing us tobacy smokin patrons out to the patio.

I remember back in the day when you could sit for hours sucking away at the tobacco pipe on the floor surrounded by pillows. Now you get stuck on patio furniture. It's okay Layalena, it's not YOUR fault. Hopefully you get heaters on said patio so I don't freeze to death. 

What I don't like and IS your fault is that you never have the tobacco flavor I want and I am always reduced to getting something second rate. In addition, you really only serve four wines and twice you have been out of what I wanted.

I guess the service is a little above average for a hookah bar, but I still feel like it takes 20 minutes to get anything and I feel like the hookah cashes out a little early, but whatevs. 

The food is good. A little overpriced. I normally get the sampler plate. The baklava (sp??) is realllly good.

I would love to sit inside and watch the bellydancers shake their moneymakers, but I am banished to the patio, so I watch admiringly from afar until I have to go into the bathroom.",3
Restaurants,"As for a chain restaurant this one is superior as for the service, cleanliness and food are top notch. Very friendly service.",4
Restaurants,"Gave one star because I had to give something, don't let Bianca take your order because she doesn't know the menu. I had to take my food back 3 times before they got it right.",1
Restaurants,"Worst place ever! I did not stop in fast food places in ages. Decided to use restroom after shopping & get quesadilla . Girl was cleaning floor then smashed her nose , cleaned with her pants, then decided to take order..... I asked her to wash her hands first. She said Oh yeah, & went to restroom . Later took my order, just one quesadilla .... I had to wait it for 11-12 minutes.... Really? 
Fast food????? Easier to stop in restaurant ! Place is sooooo dirty! Trash over filled .... I thru away quesadilla but left just a coke to drink...... Yucky!!!!",1
Restaurants,"Ordered the Teriyaki Burger combo with no lettuce, tomato, or mayo. Waited a while for our food and they brought it out to our table. When I unwrapped my sandwich, it had everything on it that I didn't want. So I had to take it back up to the counter and wait for someone to acknowledge me so I could tell them it was wrong. Had to wait awhile longer to get my new sandwich. Ate fries while I waited. They were ok, not super fresh. The burger came out as I asked, however there were onions on it which I was not sure about when I ordered, but those were easy to pull off. The burger was quite tasty with the pineapple and teriyaki sauce. Ran out of napkins at our table and had to steal some from another table. Overall, could have been better.",2
Restaurants,"I went to this place on 12/14/15 and a worker by the named of Jesus was making racial comments as I was ordering. And to top that off after I paid for my order and left, somehow they charged my card for another amount. Now I have to go through the hassel of trying to dispute this with my card. I will be filing a complaint on this restaurant and finding out who owns this dump.",1
Restaurants,"The only reason I gave an additional star was because I was greeted as I entered and the employee opened the door for me. The food was pretty good.

The bathroom was utterly disgusting. The urinal was bagged and labeled out of order. The remaining stall in the men's room was just horrid. I took a picture for reference.",2
Restaurants,They take foreverrrrrrrrr everytime! First time actually going in and it was super dirty!,1
Restaurants,"Good food, good prices, and good service.

Nothing too ""Extreme"" about Extreme Pita, except maybe the welcome alternative to a burger and fries.

It also has an over-lit, generic, fast-food decor which inhibits digestion.",3
Restaurants,"I have to agree with Michael C, there's nothing extreme here.  The food was A-OK and better than McWendyKing's.  I did find the service and presentation fit the mold of other fast food joints and that's not a good thing.

One of the guys behind the counter was a persistent up-seller which quickly became annoying.",3
Restaurants,"I hang out in this complex a lot (at Gold Bar) and finally broke down and ate here recently.  Here's my thoughts on the whole place.

Extreme Pita isn't bad.  It's just not great.  I mean, theres a decent menu, prices are okay, service is mediocre.  But, something about it feels like a subway with pitas.  I got the gyro pita, and it was fine, but it just isnt anything that I would crave/miss food wise.

Like Micheal C said, it has an overlit, generic fast food decor feeling to it.  I think he said it best in his review of this place, and pretty much covered how I feel about Extreme Pita.  Go Micheal C!",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Great dance studio. Wonderful teachers. Hip-Hop, tap, jazz, ballet, pointe, youth to adult. Even home to the Dancin' Dads.

The only issue I have is that during the busiest class times, it can be difficult to find a place to sit and actually watch the kids dance. However, since many studios don't allow that anyways, I guess it is not a bad thing.

Their website is http://www.MadAboutDance.com",5
Arts & Entertainment,It's a nice and a friendly place for my kids. Great studio. The teachers are pacient and take care and kind to everybody.,4
Arts & Entertainment,"My child doesn't go here, however, I was sitting at churches eating right next to this place & a little girl about 3 or 4 years old came in saying she couldn't find her mom. I somewhat panicked because I had no idea of the studio in the complex or where the little girl came from but I decided to walk around with her to figure it out. This young girl was supposed to be being watched by these teachers and she was out roaming around! I'm appalled at this place and I honestly should have called authorities over it. I couldn't imagine how the parents would have been if they knew she was roaming the parking lot especially since churches is on the outskirts of Cactus Rd! So just a piece of advice, WATCH OUT for this place & who you are leaving in charge of your child. They clearly are unprofessional & when classes are out, they just throw the kids out to find their parents on their own.",1
Restaurants,Good wings.  Too bad they stopped serving carrots with them.  Don't order anything else though.,3
Restaurants,"We were at Gene Autry baseball fields for a morning game that lasted until 1pm and then we just had to get something to eat before heading back to Scottsdale. 

One of the guys had mentioned seeing this place, and it seemed like a perfect spot for a bunch of smelly ball players after a hot winning game. There were about 13 of us and we ventured on in. The restaurant was clean and the perfect sport bar/restaurant. Tons of tvs and very friendly staff. They pulled together four tables for us and got us started on drinks a computer game for playing trivia. 

Our waitress, meigken (not sure on the spelling, but the pronunciation was MIKEN) was very friendly and outgoing. She had enough spunk and quick retorts for even our best smart a*& in the bunch. It was great! We all got our drink orders and proceeded to place our food orders. They had some specials with pulled pork slammers, some good looking appetizers, wings, ribs, wraps, lots of choices. 

Several of the guys ordered the slammers, and I ordered a naked tenders wrap with honey mustard. Our first attempt at the trivia was pittiful until a bunch of the guys began noticing what was going on. More brains are better, I have decided. Our meals showed up and we all started eating. The pulled pork slammers were delicious. The sauce on the pulled pork was great, just what I like. My naked tender wrap was light, but tasty. I did put some medium wing sauce on there to spice it up a bit. I like spicy and the medium was right up my alley. 

Everyone seemed to enjoy their food. No real complaints to speak of. The service was excellent. All 13 orders showed up as ordered and the boys were content with their lunch. Who knows if it would have been different with a loss on the field, but I think the place got good remarks all around. All bellies content and it was back to all of our respective resorts/condos for a nap.",4
Restaurants,"I came here with the family the day after Thanksgiving to watch some football. We ordered some boneless wings that were pretty good and Miller Lites that were on special for $3. The bartender/server seemed pretty annoyed to be working and wasn't very attentive, even though the place was empty. After we finished the wings we ordered some more food. This food was bad, a few burgers and some sort of soft taco plate. Nothing was good. 
The televisions are very outdated as well, no HD, flat screens, plasmas, or LCDs. Just small 20 inchers and some very large projection screens. The video quality was very poor, the projection screens were very washed out, to where you could barely view. The small TVs didn't have a clear picture. I would think if you advertise so much as being a sports bar as they do, the TVs would be up-to-date.
I was really disappointed in this place, I love hot wings and beer, I thought it would be a good spot.",2
Restaurants,Stopped by to try the new Grilled Chicken Salad Sandwich it was good however the drive thru speaker needs to be updated because the guy taking me order could not hear me and I had to yell (not good). I have also had the Fish Fillet sandwich here and it was good too; it has been years since I had one of their beef sandwiches and I don't think I can eat one now that I know what a good Roast Beef sandwich taste like. But their Market Place options are quite tasty give them a try.,3
Restaurants,"So let's see....I know Arby's is known for it's world Famous ROAST BEEF.....however I want to talk turkey.....that's right TURKEY.....LOL. The Grand Turkey Club.....and Turkey n Cheddar Classics are in a word AWESOME!!!!! However....and not to offend you Roast Beef lovers.....The Arby's Market Fresh Turkey Cheddar and Ranch Sandwich may simple be the best Sandwich of it's kind in all of AZ. So if your brave Roast Beef fans....I DARE YOU to try Arby's Turkey and Market Fresh offerings and by all means Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!",4
Restaurants,"It's a fast food joint, that being said everything here went off without a hitch. They even brought our order to us at the table.  That's something I've never seen done by this chain.  I hope they keep up the good work.",3
Restaurants,My grams and I have been coming here since I was a very young girl. She likes sharing this Arby's with me when she is on this side of town. When I was little a woman named Penny worked here and she we always so polite. Now as an adult people come and go. Today my grams heard someone ask for a senior discount right after she ordered and paid. They were granted the discount. She asked if it was too late if she could get one and they told her yes it was too late. That is very disappointing. When I worked in food service we would have gladly refunded and then redid the order with the senior discount applied.,1
Restaurants,"Arby's is a nice change of pace when you're in a fast food mood (or time compressed).  

The Beef'n'Cheddar is a comforting reminder of simpler times (make sure to ask for Horsey Sauce to go with it) and their curly fries are really good.  

Used to LOVE the jamocha shakes (back when my metabolism could support that...)",3

Restaurants,"I entered Shabu Fondue this evening anticipating a fun and filling meal. While fondue is always fun, I found this particular meal was lacking in the filling department. My husband and I ordered the cheese course for two (swiss and emmenthal cheeses with white wine and lemon), which was really delicious with apple slices and bread chunks. We followed up with steak and chicken (served with a selection of vegs and a hot, seasoned chicken broth). In retrospect, we should have given this course a miss and ordered more of the cheese! 

The cheese course cost us $13.00 for two (portion size was very small), while the ribeye cost $15.95 and the chicken $14.95 (all prices exclusive of taxes). We both definitely felt that we would have been better off eating at The Melting Pot because, while it is more expensive, it offers better value -- bigger portions, a larger selection of meats and seafood, more choices in regards to cooking methods (oils and different kinds of broths), and fixed price menus for groups with 2+ people. 

The atmosphere at Shabu was also lacking. A restaurant's quality can often be measured by how many covers it has in an evening. On the day after Christmas Day a restaurant should be buzzing. Shabu was nearly empty.

I will say that our server was quite excellent, though. She was attentive and a great conversationalist. If the food we had consumed had been to the same standard, I would definitely have rated this restaurant with 5 stars.",2
Restaurants,"I lived in France for a few years, and I'm a bit of a cheese snob.

I found the cheese here to be much, much better than Melting Pot.

I do have to agree with the other reviewer in that it really was quite expensive, and each time I've visited the place was nearly empty.....",4
Restaurants,"This place is quite expensive, for a fondue experience that was kind of lacking. We had the Margarita cheese fondue, which was pretty good (soft pretzels, OMG), then he had shrimp and chicken, while I went with prime rib. His was soooooo boring. Mine was ok. The broth was forgettable, but the horseradish sauce was really good. My breath, not so much, but it made the meat much more interesting. Decent assortment of veggies, but I felt like I was in Munchkinland, with the portions. The dessert... well, who can go wrong with chocolate and caramel? Only chocolate and peanut butter would have topped that. 

The service was... mmmm, well, I went with my standard 18%. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good. It just was. 

Two stars for the experience falling way short of the usual fondue expectation, and for having to stop and get a something to munch afterwards.",2
Restaurants,"I've done the Shabu Fondue more times than I can count!  Usually, I order a cheese fondu for myself, and my main man gets a Shabu dish.  They both apply the same concepts... dip something fresh into something very hot and cook it yourself with long sticks.  Mm!  I've tried all the cheese fondues, and the Swiss is my favorite.  That smell is unforgettable.  I've tried all the Shabu sauces too, and they're all pretty strong, so they season those boring vegetables right up.  The cocktail menu should not be over-looked.  The caramel apple martini is the best!!!  Now the chocolate fondue....  Oh it's so good!  They serve it with marshmallows, fruit and even a slice of cheesecake to dip in!  For a very small price, you can also add a shot of liquor.  (I personally always add a shot of Bailey's to add some flavor.)  This is a PERFECT date restaurant, and it's not bad for groups either.  The dcor is pretty rad too.  The portions are healthy, but it only works if you end the dinner with the chocolate...",5
Restaurants,"I took my less adventurous daughter here one evening because I personally love fondue ever since I first had it in Switzerland.  She said she wasn't that hungry and didn't want ""the works"" so we just got the Swiss cheese fondue and the dessert fondue.  It was more than enough--we had to take some of the chocolate home to finish later!  Both were as delicious as I hoped and the service was very good.  We sat at a counter rather than a table but that's fun to do once in awhile.  I have no complaints.  We intended to come back here before I returned to San Diego but there were so many fun little restaurants to try that we just never made it back.  Maybe next trip!",5
Restaurants,"I'm a huge fondue fan and I really enjoyed Shabu Fondue.  I've been to The Melting Pot and preferred the ambiance of Shabu Fondue better.  It's more quaint and cozy.  The food was delicious; the sauces were flavorful and I was full!  It's a bit pricey, however, it was worth it.",4
Restaurants,"I was a bit disappointed in the experience as a whole.  The food was meh, desert was pretty good, but way overpriced for what we got and not made for a big guy.  I've done fondue and been well full and satisfied, just not this time and not for what we spent.  Had the bread, vegetable cheese appetizer and the chicken, shrimp, and steak main.  Sauces were excellent, broth was meh again.  Desert is kinda hard to screw up but the chocolate was oily and clumpy, didn't melt well.  The scenery was excellent and decor is what a modern restaurant should be. I won't be back but try it yourself.",2
Restaurants,"The first time I went, the husband and I took my mom when she was in town and I didn't get a great over all impression. In fact, I was slightly disappointed. Our server took FOREVER between courses. There is a difference in taking time to let us enjoy our experience since fondue IS an experience, not just a regular dinner but this was over the top. Also... my silverware was dirty and I had to send it back and request a new set. Ick. 

We decided to try it again being that the last time we went it was rather late on a Sunday night. 

Our second experience was better but they still took a long time to switch out fondue pots and get us started on our next course. 

The food, once  you finally get it, has always been tasty. I order the beef and shrimp combo. The chocolate fondue desserts are very good and they offer a decent selection of fruits and such for it. I must say my best fondue experience was in California though... that place even topped The Melting Pot, which I love. 

I would say this place is a good alternative to the pricey Melting Pot, good for a date or a group of friends, not so great for a special dinner or anything. They have a nice bar and everything is a fair price.",3
Restaurants,"The service was horrible!  Forever between courses, no wait staff was ever around.  Our waiter actually turned off the burner as he served our main course.  We could not cook our meal!!!  Then we couldn't find anyone to turn the dang thing on.  It took 15 minutes for someone to appear where we could flag them down.  It was a Wednesday night and only 5 tables had customers, so no excuses there.  It was horrible.

My shrimp was freezer burned!  The broth was flavorless.  The dipping sauces are very strong, no mild choices. 

Did they offer free dessert for screwing up our meal, no, nothing but ""here's your overpriced check"".

Melting Pot is worth the extra money!",1

Sure, we have some idiots in office that have made bad decisions, but I think as we get a little bigger (not to big I hope) there will be more voice from the people in this small town.  Roads need fixing for sure, but we chose to live out here, at least I did, so I knew what they were like - so for me to sit and do nothing but complain about it would be idiotic.  You knew what you were getting into people!  Anyway, I really do love it out here and plan on making this my home until I can afford a house on the beach in Ventura (true goal someday)  Even so, I will probably keep my home here and go between the two places - that's how much I love the desert and living out here!

Public Services & Government,"I'm very happy with the way this city is run, and the 30+ years of dealing with them in many capacities, I rank them with the best. So, why not five stars? ...Come on, we're talking government here.

The Building Department and Land Development is where I have the most experience, and it comes down to personnel, which when you follow the trail, leads to good training, good hiring, good management. People are always helpful at the counters, personable, and I've never been given an attitude, or have felt as if I was putting someone out by asking a question, like some government agencies.

City Hall is big, and the building is impressive with a large foyer with some seating if necessary, to meet with clients and associates. The high ceiling, some five stories high, makes it conducive to conversation without feeling like someone is listening in on your next big project, and there's a Starbucks located there to keep the energy going at that 3 o'clock slumping hour.

Arts & Entertainment,"Horrible customer service, the owner and both her mother and father are bossy and rude.  They are not helpful, they come around to your table and don't offer to teach you anything, just manage to interrupt you and try to engage you in conversation.
When you go to get your pottery they bark at you if you try to grab it.  If you are worried stuff with get broke, MOVE IT to the BACK of the store!!!
We've gotten other people's pottery in our bag before too...I'd be angry about that if my kids stuff was missing.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Customer service does not get much worse than it is at this place.  After my wife spent over four hours working on a nice plate for our family, we found out that it was broken from others that attended the event at the studio.  She called to speak to the owner and after a week of not hearing back she finally got her on the phone.  The owner said that as a policy, she does not call customers back.

I am fine with that as we are no longer customers.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"This is the worse experience with a pottery place I have ever had!  Don't do it!  Go to AsYou Wish where they value the customers, call you back, help you when THEY have lost something that really you can't just bring a four year old back in and redo.  Not only did they lose my Christmas ornament, they lost that of my friend.  My husband who has a terminal illness painted an ornament with my daughter.  After two weeks and I finally called them...they said ""you can bring them in""  -- not so easy.  Asked for my money back and they said no.  While we were there it was utter chaos as it was from the old woman who works there.  We were the only ones in the place and she was so incapable of helping us.  This place is awful and STAY AWAY!  Go to As You Wish.  Might be a farther drive but after going there three or four times...I will never ever come back to this place.  The owner is even a bigger rude woman than I have experienced.  She has no business in a retail customer service industry.  I was so excited to have a birthday party there and after this experience I decided NO WAY!!",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I passed by this studio after watching a movie nearby and decided I might like to paint some pottery.  The doors were open so I walked right in, it was empty except for two women working there.  As I walked towards the pottery, one older woman started quickly walking towards me with this scowl - I flashed her my pearly whites and she still approached me as if she was about to go medieval on my ass.    I have no idea why she was so cranky but hell if I was gonna drop a dime in there, I bolted.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I agree with the above evaluations.  I just moved here from the East Coast and have had a lot of fun with this type of pottery studio.  However, this business ruined the entire experience for my daughters and I.  The very unhelpful and grumpy woman that helped us didn't say a word to make us feel welcome.  The pottery is extremely over-priced and they will sneak in an aditional sitting fee for the adult who helps a child paint even a small section of their piece.  In addition, we hoped to give our homemade gifts to dad for his birthday and they never called to tell us they were  done.  When I went in to pick them up and was disappointed they didn't seem to even care.  This is one of the most unprofessional businesses I have ever been to.  I wish I could give zero stars.",1

She seriously should not be running a company, she has no idea how to treat people who are spending their hard earned money in her store.  I will never ever be back and I will make sure to tell all my friends to NOT go here.  The items are extremely overpriced and then to top it off the nasty attitude of the workers...it just doesn't get much worse.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I went in to Creative Hands Studio to pick up my ceramic that I created and paid for a week ago.

To start it off, Cody (the son of the owner) was on the phone talking to his friend saying he'd call the person back in a few minutes because a customer just walked in.  Told him that I was there to pick up my mug.  He couldn't find my ceramic that I picked up right away so he told me that he'd call me.

So I mentioned to him that I paid $34 last week for something that he lost?  And he IMMEDIATELY corrected me and SHOWED me the receipt and said, ""No, you only paid $28.""  I said, well, regardless, you LOST my ceramic?  He said, ""No, it's just not here right now.""  

His mom owns the studio, he says, and RUDELY says to me ""Can I call you when I find it or do we have to continue this conversation?""

Seriously....""do we have to continue this conversation?""

Honestly, if the owner of this studio doesn't get her son UNDER CONTROL with his attitude, she's going to lose all of her customers.

Whatever happened to the customer is ALWAYS right?

And WHAT?!?!?  Cannot find a ceramic that was PROMISED to me?

I will NEVER go back to this place.  Owner not there...puts her sons in charge... Whatever.

How do we put these people out of business????",1
Arts & Entertainment,I go here often and I have always loved it. They have a large selection to choose from. The store is family owned and everyone there is super helpful and nice. If you need help trying to create a certain look on your piece just ask and they will be more then happy to help. Everything I have made there has turned out great.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"My kids love to paint pottery and I like to support local businesses but I agree with the other poor reviews, the customer service at Creative Hands is the worst I've seen.  The helpers are surly and one worker wasn't even wearing shoes - GROSS!  I didn't paint anything myself, but did help my kids with detailed area and the other finish up as we were running out of time.  The owner insisted on charging me the 7$ paint fee for an adult despite the fact that I was only helping my kids.  Creative Hands got my 7$ but lost my business forever - As You Wish beats this place hands down, and they actually know what customer service is all about.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Wish I could give negative 5.  1st my nieces had fun...let that be known.  They are kids...boxes over their heads at Christmas time is also fun.  While they were there someone else dropped a piece of pottery and it cut and sliced my nieces leg and foot. The owner did not ask if she was OK my mom asked for a towel to clean up the blood and the young girl finally offered a band aid.  OK  things happen.  They were to call when the pottery was fired and ready. Once again the owner said she tried to call once any left a message....went through the phone log no message.  So my mom called spoke with the owner and said my daughter would be in to pick the pieces up.

I go in to pick them up the young girl asked for the name...my mom said it would be under my nieces first names.  So I gave the 1st names of my nieces....the young girl said NO we NEVER put it under the first name......so I give the two possible last names......Sorry can't find it...can't find the paper work.

I go over and ask the a women that is chatting if she is the owner (she was having a conversation with another employee and seemed bothered that I interrupted her conversation) and said yes what can I help you with.  I said my Mom said I would be picking up my NIECES work and it would be under the 1st name..... and your employee said we ""NEVER"" do that.  The owner said oh yeah it's under the 1st name.  ""NEVER""  REALLY?  ""NEVER""

They find the pieces keep in mind it has been over two weeks and the young girl asks what color is the lid to the cupcake was that your daughter made.....OK not my daughter....she again assumed....I said I didn't know I wasn't here when my nieces made them.  She said there was NO WAY OF KNOWING what cupcake top was to go with the bottom.  The owner explained that they fire several pieces at the same time so there is ""NO WAY"" to keep track.  Really how about paper work initials on the inside of the clay....Really ""NO WAY'.....my smart mouth response was it's a good thing you don't run a funeral cremation.  They young girl says my family is in that business and people get the wrong ashes all the time.  (I couldn't make this story up if I tried). Really wish I would have gotten the name of that business. WOW not only might I get a wrong lid to a cupcake but the wrong ashes of a loved one.  WHAT  THE  WHAT! I said I could see why they got bad online reviews.  The owner response we have been here for 9 years and all the people that take the time to offer bad reviews are negative people.  Well YELPERS look at my distribution.  I do not give bad reviews unless.......it is HORRIBLE!   It is a good thing she has her inner circle that keeps them in business.",1
Arts & Entertainment,Great place and people.  They carry a large selection of products and Paints!!!  Better then the chain one here in the valley.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"I happened upon this shop while looking to make a few special gifts. The folks there were very helpful and there were a lot of choices for pieces. There were lots of idea books around. I saw several pieces in the windows for inspiration as well. I wanted to try some techniques I was unfamiliar with and I asked for help from several of the workers as well as the owner. Everyone was very helpful and willing to support me.  I repeated went back and asked for support and everyone helped me along the way.  Toward the end of my piece, I ran out of the paint color I needed and the owner searched for some in her private stash and helped me finish. I didn't read the comments on Yelp until after I had been there. All I can say is that my experience was different and that I would return. Maybe they took the comments to heart and change how they did things. I would recommend this for any painting project.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"It's fun, and priced very fair, but have had a couple bad experiences here.  One year we had a birthday party, and with the party you get a plate made for your child.  I took over 7 months to get the plate and repeated calls.  The hours on the website are not correct, after driving to the place on a Tuesday morning to find out they actually don't open until 1pm not 11am.  It's ok, my 5 year old only waited 3 days to go paint, to find out that they were closed and would have to go another day because we have afternoon plans.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"The prices are decent BUT the customer service was HORRIBLE. The boyfriend and I went in for an afternoon of wheel throwing. The owner stayed in her seat and pointed where we had to go (we should have turned around an left then but I wanted to give the place a chance). I asked about the prices and she gave an sarcastic remark but we still stayed. She finally got up and gave us the clay and made sure we had all the tools we needed. I then asked an question about the wheel (b/c it had been 6yrs since I was on the pottery wheel); she had her back turn she answered my question but then she said it will come back to you. At that point my BF was ready to go to the owner was being rude and she showed horrible customer service. Once we were done we paid for the wheel throwing and I asked the owner when are we supposed to come back to glaze our items (we made like 10 items) ; she said in a week. Well a week past and I called to make sure our items were ready to be glazed before we drove back to the shop; well at first she stated she didn't have an order under my name (I put everything under my name), then she stated that she found it and she asked me how many items I had and I told her, then she stated ""it's not ready and she will call me when it's ready."" Well it has been over a month and she still haven't called. This place was an good idea but it is ruined by the owner having horrible customer service skills and horrible business practices.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"My experience here was aweful. I never write bad reviews assuming we all have bad days. But this place is an exception!  From our first visit creating our art to picking up the finished products, every employee and/or owner was unhelpful, unfriendly,  and down right rude. The customer service doesnt exist and any questions you have will be answered as though you are a bother to them. I always support smaller businesses but i will never return to this one!",1
Arts & Entertainment,"It's a shame that I have to write this review due to the fact that I've been here on other occasions and been happily serviced. But this one instance has ended my wishes to return. My mother and I have been going to this location for a couple years now with both my nephews and brother and just us ourselves as well and haven't had awful experiences as those who have reviewed so negatively below. We used to love this place. The owner seemed knowledgeable and somewhat friendly, but we never needed to pester her with too many questions so I can't say we saw her ""mean"" side as many have stated before. But my grandmother, mother, and I went in on a Tuesday a few weeks ago and were so excited to paint some Christmas presents for a few women from the church. We had been planning this day for about a month and had everything ready, even the coupon for my grandmothers first painting experience we had found on their website. The same website we found their hours, all listed accordingly. But, we were sadly mistaken when we as arrived to their location. The door was locked and unlike the hours stated online, it had said that we're closed on Tuesdays. Tuesday's? Really? Such a random and pointless day! At least update your website so that customers can plan better. We decided to go to ""As You Wish"" on Gilbert and Germann instead and had a far better experience we had hoped for. I am sad to end our business here, but something better came out of it.",1
Arts & Entertainment,We have been here SEVERAL times and the employees and the owner have always been nothing but friendly and accommodating! They have an amazing variety of pieces to chose from! It is not cheap ... But it is FUN !!  Well worth the $$ spent !!,5
Arts & Entertainment,"Just don't go!! The owner is not accommodating, in fact I am not even sure she likes kids? We spent about 65 dollars for 20 minutes of ""fun"" and there was no help with choosing paints, any instruction from the owner, hints, etc. also we tried to go on a Tuesday the first time and it was closed! 
She mostly seemed annoyed that we were there. 
Also I was charged to just sit down in a chair with my 10 month old son. I said that I may help my girls paint (which I didn't end up being able to do because of baby) and she still charged me a 7 dollar painting fee?!
Also she never called to say my order was ready and I was sent home with a piece that didn't belong to me!! Ahhhh! Just don't waste your time and money!",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Sad to see such negative reviews here as we have come to this shop many times over many years and have never had a negative experience. It's definitely not a chain store- you get the impression you are visiting an actual person's space and not a cookie cutter franchised paint factory (don't get me wrong- I like those too!)

I love all the tiles with good wishes from friends and I love how it feels like you are just hanging out in someone's art studio and painting while life actually happens around you. I love the selection of pottery to paint, every single employee we have encountered has been kind, helpful, knowledgeable and usually pretty fun, too!

I'm thankful for all of the good experiences we have had here and hope to keep coming back for many years!!!",5

(Father's Day gift) As soon as we entered, the door was held for us and we were pleasantly assisted! The first woman to help out was a loyal, returning customer that was actually painting with a visitor from out-of-state that was also a returning customer!!! The lovely woman that went by the name of D was beyond kind and very helpful every step of the way. My 2 1/2 year-old son absolutely loved her:) D helped us as we painted both my toddler and newborns feet and hands. So much patience! The items to chose from were many, by far and the colorful space for our littles was great! Thank you D for making our visit such a memorable experience. Highly recommended!",5

I like it for the Sauce, Borders, and Urban to be honest. Just steps a way from Fashion Square I usually only go as part of my fashion square experience. Above Scottsdale Waterfront are the Waterfront Condos which I haven't yet toured, but I'm sure they a pure luxury. I'm not sure what the new craze is with living above malls..Kierland and here, but people are loving it!

Local Flavor,"Jeez. A water front? Now I know peeps from Arizona LOVE to come and soak up the sun and play here in San Diego... But, PHLEEEEEEEEEEZE. Scottsdale! Shame on you.

I can only imagine that hotels will start to advertise beachfront rooms...",1

And did you know that Arizona has more boat owners per ca pita than any other state? Red or blue. So obviously we like our water. Naturally Scottsdale and their developers ponied up some dough to revitalize the waterfront. The stinky, stinky waterfront. Ahhh...yes, nothing like the stench of sulfur and sewage as you stroll the shops and eateries with family from out of town. But I have to give them props for linking Fashion Square to Oldtown. Brilliant. We were thre recently and, having never tried Olive and Ivy yet, wow, what a spread they have. Huge doors opening to the patio, overlooking the, er, um, water, river..., well it's a canal. A concrete canal with brown water. For now. Today. Three stars. But I'm an optimist who knows that more landscaping and better architecture are in the near future. Now if only they could install a giant Glade plug in somewhere. Or maybe we can hold a yelp event there with the Febreze people.",3

Waterfront is a stretch, its a canal, a stinking fucking canal.. leave it to the Scottsdale developers and planners to put a Scottsdalian slant on the turd.. kudo's to them! However, with its chain stores and restaurants on one side and pretty lame so far on the other (Southbridge) this has become quite a giant and over priced turd.

Local Flavor,"The developers have done a great job at marketing this place.  Only in Scottsdale can you dig up a ditch and call it ""waterfront"". I am debating whether to give it a three star, because I don't want to be a hater, but this is not what I think of waterfront.  I do have a waterfront condo in FL, now that is waterfront.",2

Local Flavor,"The waterfront area is coming along as it matures. Several shops/restaurants have closed - only to be replaced with better ones that are now thriving. I think this will be THE SPOT in old town within a few years. I like Culinary Dropout, The Herb Box, and Metro Brasserie. There are also dozens of other local restaurants, bars, gallery's, and independent shops too.",4
Local Flavor,"I literally walked in a giant circle looking for this supposed ""waterfront"" and when I finally discovered it, I just had to stop and laugh. It has potential to be a neat place to hang out, but they gotta do some more development. At least it's close to other stuff!",2
Local Flavor,"Only good as a laugh to show out of towners,  Come on!  It's just a canal and some irrelevant shopping,  probably the brilliant idea of a wealthy idiot with a coke habbit.   Nothing else can explain something that cost as much to implement to be so incredibly stupid and pathetic.",1
Local Flavor,"We run this baby ... ;-) this is where I run... to center myself.. to get my self 'back' . Some people go to the gym.. and no joke.. I do too..BUT trust me.. IF I have a choice, I would rather be outside with nature..and in PHX this is close to my home and the best I can do. It's rather safe, as I like to run at night. It's pretty lighted and friendly, in terms of other walkers and runners and what nots. No excuses.. get out.. get it done.",4
Local Flavor,"Once in a blue moon I take a weekend day off from work and head over to Scottsdale Waterfront to The Herb Box to treat myself to breakfast.  It being the weekend, there usually are local (and not-so-local) vendors that set up booths of leather belts, desert flora, crystal wind chimes and sun catchers, clothing with positive messages printed all over them, local honey, and even a sweet treat, or two.  (I've seen Hawai'ian pastries there once, or twice, and the last time featured flavored Italian ice treats!)  Sometimes, when valley weather is nice, the canal may even feature installations that catch your eyes, and sometimes makes you want to stop and take photos.

I've read a few reviews that comment on the stagnant-water/sulphuric acid scent (which is what I've always associated with the word ""canal"" and is the reason why I never visited the ill-fated restaurant of the same moniker that closed its doors years ago) that sometimes wafts over, but I usually only detect that scent when I've crossed over to the other side of the road from Olive & Ivy.  I guess I've been lucky enough not to detect the foul fumes near my beloved Herb Box.  :)",3
Local Flavor,"The name is a bit misleading.  Technically, there's water and this area is located adjacent to it.  However, it doesn't deliver on the goods for people, like me, who are accustomed to a different setting when they see/hear ""waterfront"" in a name.

Despite the misleading moniker, this area is still pretty cool at times.  There's a ton of special event.....festivals, outdoor shopping tents, and random celebrations.  I like how they're trying to do something different.  Sometimes I think Scottsdale gets stuck in it's ""old ways"" and at least this area will try something out of the ordinary and make it interesting.

If I were single, I'd live in one of the condos nearby and have great walking access to all of Old Town.  If it wasn't for the name, I'd give it 3 Stars.  The name alone is worth a 1 Star loss because it can't deliver on that promise when the ""waterfront"" is a canal that an old lady can throw a baseball across the width of it.

Return Factor - 50%",2
Local Flavor,My brother and his wife were in town and after having dinner at Culinary Dropout we wandered about the complex.  We did not notice any foul odors and had a pleasant walk off of our dinners.,3
Local Flavor,"I work upstairs and it is a gorgeous office space with a great view. It is near many restaurant and shopping amenities. It is practically an extension of Fashion Square Mall. I admit I had no idea that there was any water until wandering around the courtyard for the tall (exclusive) condo buildings this shopping center is built around, and it is only a canal. It is dressed up with floating lights from time to time and the bridge adds a nice touch as well. There is 24 hour security and a lot to do. 

What stops me from giving it 5 stars? The elevators are slow and need to be updated on the inside; also there is still a slightly weird smell near urban outfitters that needs to be remedied despite their best efforts. It used to be a lot worse - it is just barely there now but still.",4
Local Flavor,This really is a stream.  A place to take a short walk after dinner but only if you're in the area.  Do not make any effort to come here to check it out.  This is right between the mall and Old Scottsdale and the only reason I stumbled upon this place.,2
Local Flavor,Love it. Great shopping and dining.,4
Restaurants,"Not to shabby.. I really like the cavernous dining room here because from the outside the place looks so small. Its like walking into Dr Who's call box!!

Decent enough food, though I prefer Dillon's Grand this has a younger crowd and a similar menu.",3
Restaurants,This location is closed; email with folks indicate no reopening,1
Restaurants,"Best Jack In The Box manager ever!! Teodora, prides herself taking care of this store. And it is shown by her work. Goes over and beyond a fast food staffer would ever go. The other employees there are also so friendly and make you feel you are at your own home not a fast food resturant. Had one issue first visit but Beno fixed and was very apologetic. HIGHLY recommended!!",5

Wow, just wow, now that I got a few to think, their food was bad, it was just thrown together and then then Niagara Falls of sauce, I guess to cover up that they didn't give me what I wanted, or show that they really care for my safety, as their was so much sauce that I don't even think that it was hot at all, like it was a cold 1one that they had sitting their; for this is the worst Jack in the box that I have ever been too.. ..as, that Jack in the Box, has a high stander ed to step it up, as McDonald have given fast food a bad rap, as Taco Bell is next in line and yup, this jack in the box was lower then McDonald's and that saying something.....I will not be happy if I have to eat what ever they think us food when really it's trash  covered in a ocean of sauce that hides how uncool the food is and how over baring lack of cleaning show me that they must pay their # #healthfoodinspector , for I don't think that they would pass if they had to be videoed for the text...for sure their is something off about that place...as when I came into that place their be the workers sitting down  and 1one  running around in the back as the 1one gets up to help us, as still over looking that fact that the floor be wow, food trash and all kinda stuff I bet that was not in customer eye sit. #date #dating #6#18#16#61816 @4:29pm#jackinthebox #vJackInTheBoxstorewtfe# #vstorewtfe  #needsome #deepclean #whatif#andthen #whatisthat #bathroom #mansbathrooms #mensroom#cakedpee#unwhipped , #undertoylet#unwhipped , #undertoylet #toylet",1
Public Services & Government,"I love Mesa but their utility dept. needs to be investigated for fraud. Since I'm on and off employed, I pay as many bills as I can in advance. I sent $320 in to the utility dept. which should have been about three month's worth. When my next bill was sent the following month, I noticed that my credit was not applied. I couldn't reach anyone on the phone (high volume of calls) so I took a photograph of my money order stubs and sent in a letter to this address. Two weeks later, I received a letter explaining how I was not ahead, but ""right on time"" with my payments. I called and finally reached somebody and they made every excuse in the book to make it ""make sense"" for them. I need to write to the Governor, I guess. Don't take a summer vacation and try to pay your utility bill in advance. They will take your money. Pay your bill exactly one month at a time!!!",1
Public Services & Government,"Just received my bill in the mail and for no reason, my $200 credit has been applied. It now shows nothing due at the end of this month. It's funny, first they argued and even sent a letter saying that I was right on with my payment. Now almost two months later, it's fixed without warning. Me thinks that yelping paid off.",3
Public Services & Government,"I just tried to get information about starting a Water Utilities account with the City of Mesa.  This department needs a SERIOUS overhall.  The clerk helping me was EXTREMELY rude and impatient.  She was also very ill equipped with knowledge of utilities.  This was after I had to wait 30 minutes on hold to speak to this Neanderthal.  There are a lot of pleasant people without jobs at this time who would love to work.  It is time to get rid of the ""lifers"" who consider their jobs so secure that it is not necessary to give great customer service to the inhabitants of the City of Mesa.

 they'll do it every year until the balance is done.
*My husband's driver licence was suspended because they miss-match the name on the ticket.This part has been corrected but only after many moon of suffering.

A radar trap ticket showed I drove 46 miles in school zone 3 months before.
Try ague about something happened 3 months ago when you don't even know where and what.

If you get a radar ticket from City of Mesa , deal with it right away.
or even better, avoid doing business in that city.

Public Services & Government,The city of Mesa is the absolute worst. No other gas companies charge for an upgraded meter. No pool companies have ever heard of someone getting charged at all. The city of Mesa? $800!!!!! Are you serious? And what am I supposed to do about it? They have a monopoly on my property. Worst city ever.,1

Restaurants,"this is for the superstition location in the far ne valley wings and a salad 5.99 not a bad deal 8 wings/salad service good beer selection  standard az bud, bud lt coors coors lt ect after i said do you have any good beers on tap she finally told me they had blue moon",3
Restaurants,"I love Native New Yorker!  I frequent the Gilbert and Germann location usually.  Bartender Angela and server Victoria are my favorites :)  The wing specials on Tuesday and Thurday paired with a nice cold beer, make going out to eat super cheap and enjoyable.  I love the variety of sauces they offer for the wings also.  Friday nights are karaoke and that is a blast!",5
Restaurants,"It's a sports bar. Well at least the side I go to. The other side is a restaurant but I wouldn't be throwing out 4 stars for their food!

Big HD TVs! Lots of them... That is what we want in a sports bar, right? Plus, they buy all of the sports PPV stuff. Cold beers, Big HD TV's, chicken wings and the game - this makes me happy!",4
Restaurants,"Went there on Saturday night, wasn't that busy. We sat in the lounge and did like the amount of TV's with different sporting events. Waited about 5 minutes for a server (not ours) to come and take our drink order. About 10 minutes later our drinks came, then waited for another 10 minutes for our server to take our food order. All we ordered was an appetizer, which took about 20 minutes....point I am making is it took a long time to place and receive drinks/food.
The NNY Combo Platter was good, not sure the wait is worth it though!",3
Restaurants,The crossroads of bad food and worse service. Some of the food was so bad that one taste made you spit it out. The rest of the food was cold. The server was never to be found. We had to get up and search through the restaurant four different times when we needed our server. Don't waste your time or money here. Your better off eating fast food.,1
Restaurants,I have been to the place several times with large and small groups and haven't been disappointed once. I think their honey hot wings are the best period (better than Buffalo Wild Wings and Teakwoods). Service has been real good too. I highly recommend.,5
Restaurants,"Do not come here if you are hungry.  We waited 10 minutes before someone sat us. After ordering our drinks it took 15 minutes to see our sever again to order food. After we ordered food it took 30 minutes for our appetizer to arrive. I have never waited 30 minutes for tortilla chips and spinach artichoke dip. The server warned me that the bowl was hot. The bowl was very hot but the center of the dip was still refrigerator cold...... I informed the server and she said she would be back with another.  15 minutes later she arrived with ANOTHER cold dip. I changed my order and waited.... after another 45 minutes without our entree we asked for a manager. After 10 minutes no manager showed up and we left without our food. If you own a tv and a microwave save your time and money, just cook at home. All these guys do is use a microwave and they cannot even handle that. I should also mention that the restaurant was not even half full. They will receive none of my business. ...",1
Restaurants,"I found the worst service restaurant in AZ. The app came out minutes before lunch. I had to ask 2 times to get a fork and napkin. I had to beg for a refill and the only thing promptly given was the bill. That happened to be wrong as she charged me for a side salad which I didn't receive but ordered it. I said I received fries soothe salad should be removed and the bill reduced. Then her response was well actually fries are more expensive so you are getting a discount. Thanks Miranda, I'll hopefully never see you again. If you hate your job , which is obvious, please quit and find something you are good at.",1
Restaurants,This is the 4th time I've gone in the night & sit down. It's like a ghost town...No one comes over to take our order. Sitting at the bar tonight and no bartender around. So I get up and leave. Not happy with this.,1

Restaurants,Awesome place. Great beer prices and food and Shane is a phenomenal water. Extremely attentive and efficient not to mention Shane has a great deal of charisma.,5
Restaurants,"If you're into mediocrity, this place is for you.  3 stars because they couldn't mess up the tater-tot appetizer and the queso sauce was tasty.
Roast beef for the French dip tasted old.  French fries were overly seasoned and apps and soups came out with the entrees.",3
Restaurants,Blah... The service was poor the food was average and the place reeks of bleach water... I won't come back.,2
Restaurants,"Food is good, but they seem a tad understaffed. The staff they did have was hustling and friendly, but way over worked.",4
Restaurants,"Wow. I have been to many restaurants but this one takes the prize as the worst. I had high hopes. First service was slow. Took forever to take our order. Waitress brought us a stack of appetizer plates. We did not order an appetizer. Plate on top had some black oily film on it. Back side was much worse. Informed waitress she laughed and carried it away saying something about her hang over. Next my husband opened his napkin to find encrusted food on the fork and napkin. He grabs another. Same thing on the next one. Waits an eternity for more silverware. Waitress comes back. He informs her of this, giggles, says sorry and walks off. Food was bland and boring. Never again.",1
Restaurants,"Dang it, why do I keep coming back. Crappy service everytime. Getting a menu here is near impossible after the sunsets. Getting the waiters to come over afterwards is even harder.",2
Restaurants,"Best service I've had in years
We had the fish and chips
Very well done
My only suggestion is the need more dressing on the coleslaw",5
Restaurants,"I seen the commercials, I thought the place looked cool, very '50s burger place, you'd expect girls with roller skates bringing the food. The food wasn't spectacular, it was just burgers and fries, etc.",2
Restaurants,"I've never eaten here and never had a desire to.  My wife insisted, so she won.  The food wasn't anything special, but the customer service was top notch.  And in my book customer service us 80% of the experience.  Plus, my kids dig it too.  Next time my wife suggests it as a fast food option, I won't complain too much.",4
Restaurants,"I love Sonic but this location never gets it right and they take too long. I am not exaggerating. They either can't get special orders right, orders are short, take too long, or all of the above. I usually get suckered to go back once a year thinking they'll  improve but no more. Last time I went, I ordered a cherry limeade and after waiting over 5 min on the drive thru, I left. They weren't busy or anything. Again, I love Sonic but this location is simply awful. They have serious process and quality control issues that have persisted since they first opened.",1
Restaurants,"I feel a little weird writing a review for a concept like Sonic. I mean, they're effing everywhere! If you dont know what sonic is or havent been to one, you need to get off the couch more.

Let me start by saying this. Its fast food. Theres nothing too special going on here with a couple of small but very important exceptions. The food, for the most part is unexciting. Decent burger, ok chili dog. What sets Sonic apart from the rest is the fact that they have tater tots!!!! Yes folks, tater tots. I'll eat their burger just to get to those crunchy, fried tots! They have an amazing drink selection too. They're deserts and shakes are on point if you need that late night sweet tooth fix.

So, over the past week, I've seen their commercials for their new line of hot dogs. I'm a sucker for a good Chicago dog. So I decided to pop into the local sonic today to give their new Chicago Dog a shot. I went in with ZERO expectations. I was blown away! They serve an amazing Chicago Dog. Dont believe me? Check it out for yourself. Good job, sonic! You nailed it!",4
Restaurants,Go for happy hour and try out a tasty beverage. I'm a vegetarian so I never get a burger. But its still most definitely worth a trip when you're craving a cold treat!,3
Restaurants,Average,3
Restaurants,"I have been to this Sonic several times and more often than not their credit card system is down. The problem is once you pull in the drive thru you are stuck. So you dont get the treat you wanted and you have to sit there. So annoying. So the moral of the story is, if you come to this Sonic make sure you have cash or it is a waste of your time.",1
Restaurants,I didn't like that there were people in street clothes going in to the kitchen and walking around and getting their own drinks. There were 3 different cars during the time that we were there that had numerous people in the car with them and they would all go in and visit the workers and get their own food n drinks. Maybe they are employees.  I don't know but it seems very dirty and unsanitary to me to have them in n out. It was about 9 30 - 10 30 pm that we were there. My sisters corn dog came out and it was smashed. It had marks on it like it was stuck in a waffle iron or something. Also...the debit card reader wasn't working.,2
Restaurants,"""Stick to drinks"". They used to have a decent value of food for the dollar. Nope, not anymore. 2nd time I've gone through the drive-thru and ordered a ""Ultimate Meaty Breakfast Burrito w/ Sausage"" and what I actually receive is an ""Ultimately Tiny Pathetic Joke Burrito"". I swear as soon as I got to work to eat my burrito and opened up the bag to pull out the burrito I was disappointed. I was looking around for someone to come up with a camera and say, surprise it's a joke!! I ordered medium tots but I guess those are now small too. What a waste of my time today and money, too many options out there then to spend my money here. One more thing, their drive-thru is almost the slowest I've ever been through anywhere. Bring your taxes next time if you go through the drive-thru.",2
Restaurants,"Will never go tongue sonic again, not sure what has happened to it, used to be good but now the service is painfully slow and the food is cold and disgusting. I know it's fast food...but have some pride in what you are serving people. I tried to call to complain to them directly but they don't answer their phone either.",1
Restaurants,"Great food. However no food is worth waiting 20 minutes in the Drive-Thru for. Its a shame because i love the food but fast food should have an emphasis on ""fast"".",2
Restaurants,Poor and slow service. My order is chronically incorrect and I have yet to see an adult managing all of the teenagers who appear to be more interested in socializing than doing any part of their jobs. I would recommend only purchasing drinks and only braving the drive through line when it's short and you have a decent amount of time out of your busy life to waste sitting in your car! Disappointing to say the least! The owner would be well advised to spend some time in his/her restaurants!,1
Restaurants,"Simply put, this location is understaffed (at all hours of the day) and under-managed!!

I have been to this location on several occasions to order breakfast. They advertise a breakfast burrito and a large drink for $3. They also advertise that this particular ""deal"" is guaranteed in under 2min or the ""next one is free""! Yeah... okay!! They have failed to deliver on this customer promise each of the three times I have ordered it... and have over charged me each time (I guess it's too difficult for them to understand their own promotion). Nevertheless, I am documenting each visit and have attempted, on several occasions, to reach out to the district manager. The next step is to contact the better business department regarding the false advertisement (because it is blatantly occurring here).

I encourage you to visit this location and document your own experience. I hope it is better than mine.",1
Restaurants,Wonderful fresh food and the nicest ladies you would ever want to serve you!  Love the soups and the fruit cookie is to die for!  Tell them MaryLou in San Diego sent you!  Visit the cute Rubber stamp store next door while you're there!  Hi guys!,5
Restaurants,"Despite this restaurants shabby location and exterior it was actually darn good.

It's grouped together in courtyard setting with a few other shops.

I ordered a half sandwich (ham, Havarti, cucumber, mixed greens and honey mustard on whole grain) and the soup of the day (corn chowder) served with a cookie of my choice for dessert $6.95 not bad!

Now this is a small place, cute and cottagy ,hence the name, one waitress and one cook.

 I had a view of the kitchen and watched this lady that was not unlike my own mother  prepare each order with loving care. Everything tastes better when Mom makes it right?

My food arrived after a short wait, the sandwich was generously filled and the bread tasted possibly homemade it was thick and tender, the soup was piping hot but just right to eat and was also delicious, just needed some salt and pepper. I thought it a nice touch that my plate was garnished with some pickles, a black olive, a few carrot sticks and a deviled egg. And lastly came the cookie, I chose chocolate chip and walnut, warmed and as big as the saucer it was served on. Yum!

Don't go here if you are in a hurry, Momma doesn't like to be rushed in the kitchen.

Take the time to enjoy this quaint little atmosphere with food like your Mom would make.

I would go again, I saw some salads that looked delish!",4
Restaurants,"I tried the Gilbert location of this restaurant. I believe it recently opened there on Gilbert Rd, in between Warner Rd & Elliot Rd. It was a cute location, and the atmosphere inside was quaint. 
However, the lighting was much too bright for a restaurant, and the kitchen sounds could be heard throughout the restaurant. 
Overall, my experience was horrible. My food was cold, even though it took 5 minutes longer for my food to come out than the my 3 friends' plates. The coffee was sub par, which made a horrible first impression on me. The price seemed a little much - however, I did not take advantage of the ""pastry bar"", because nothing looked too appetizing. French toast, which I thought was pretty foolproof, did not taste good. And the bacon was covered in maple syrup and some sort of brown sugar. 
I didn't feel too alone; no one in my party had rave reviews for their meals. There were 4 of us altogether, and our food barely fit on the table, which was inconvenient and very annoying. 

If I could give 0 stars, I would. I would say do not waste your time here! There are many enjoyable breakfast establishments around; this just happens not to be one of them.",1
Restaurants,"I will bet my money that the fish is frozen!! It looks like those frozen breaded fish sticks that you get out of the box...remember when you were a kid?
The salad was fine but the dressing I swear was the Kraft stuff - which is ok if that's what you want......somehow I was wishing that we stayed home.
The quality of the meal was pretty disappointing at best - so I dont remember anything else.",1
Restaurants,"Tried to eat here on Saturday night.  I say ""tried"" because we never ended up seeing our server.  We were seated promptly in a section with only two tables full.  The thing is, our server never came.  Never.  No ""hello"", no ""I'll be with you in a moment"", nothing.  Very strange, since the place was NOT busy.  A confused busboy walked by, and another waiter walked by, but nobody every came to our table.  WTF!?  We left after 10 minutes.  So, definitely give McGrath's a try if you want to be ignored.",1
Restaurants,"Horribly slow service, empty restaurant, salty broth, EXCELLENT live oysters

--server didn't know the menu. Not seeing a ""raw bar"" platter, I asked for it, was rebuffed and then saw ""raw bar"" options in the separate drinks menu
--the live oysters were awesome. So tasty!
--restaurant is cavernous but there is no one dining here. 

Go try the oysters.",2
Restaurants,"I'm glad I didn't get a chance to read the reviews here before I had my first visit, or I may not have given McGrath's a chance!  I arrived shortly after 11a (when my first visit to White Chocolate Grill turned out to be a bust since all of their breads contained corn syrup or some other allergen and so did the desserts- it struck me that the server had had enough of checking with the kitchen, so I decided I'd save him more trouble and take my business elsewhere) and was one of their first customers, so perhaps this led to my not having any problems with service.  

I found it refreshing to be able to ask the manager, who served as the host that morning, many questions and have him immediately know the answers (he only had to go back maybe twice).  This means that I don't get to annoy my server as much, although the server that day was very friendly and understanding- she also has a few food allergies to grapple with!

I had the parmesan-crusted cod, with veggies and wild rice.  However, the rice had allergens, but the server didn't even hesitate to ask what I'd like to substitute it with.  No frowns, no annoyed pauses.  Excellent service.  Afterwards, she even offered a complimentary birthday sundae!",3
Restaurants,"Was Aileen B. with me?  Actually, a couple of friends and I had dinner here last night, and if it were not for the terrific service, I would not have given this restaurant 3 stars.  The food was simply not good.  But where else in Scottsdale can one get a meal for $14.99, including bread and salad!?

The martini's were darn good, and a great bartender knows that we want that extra little yummy bit that is left in the shaker once he's poured!  This bartender did not disappoint.

My friends and I were celebrating our birthdays.  After two drinks, we had the courage to ask the Server if he could convince the General Manager and the Vice President (who were visiting that day) to come over and sing us Happy Birthday.  The General Manager did so with a smile on his face.

It's so sad when there is great service like this that the food is not better.  Where will these great Servers go when the place closes down?",3
Restaurants,"McGraths in Scottsdale is CLOSED!!!!!

The wife and I actually stepped in for lunch here today and they have a pretty affordable lunch menu. We both had halibut and shrimp fried with french fries. very good stuff! The Cole Slaw is also very good, creamy and flavorful. Coming from the Pacific North West I am very particular about fish. This halibut was white, solid and flaky. I'll be trying out the Soup and Salad next time. Gotta' have good clam chowder or it just aint' a fish house!",4
Restaurants,Tried to pop into White Chocolate Grill the other night only to find an hour and a half wait.  Should have waited!  Instead we walked across the parking lot and found a cheap seafood chain that is actually worse than Red Lobster.  Please stay away as you will only be disappointed by their failure at every turn.  The only reason for the second star was that our server was actually quite funny.  We probably should have been able to guess the quality of food we were in store for when the Mahi Mahi was $9.,2
Restaurants,"Honestly, I don't know why there's two different pages for the same restaurant, but regardless this restaurant is CLOSED!

I would've given the restaurant three stars for inconsistent service, but hurry up and mark this closed so you don't give false hope of close seafood.",1
Restaurants,"Let's Do Dinner is a meal prep kitchen.  I've been going there about once every other month for more than a year.  Prices are about $22 for a meal that feeds six...steak dishes cost more for obvious reasons.  You visit the website, check out the menu, choose the dished you would like to make and when you want to make them and pay with a credit card.   On your chosen date, you go there with a cooler or boxes to carry the meals home.  They've got aprons, a sink to clean up, and disposable gloves.  The recipes are framed and displayed at each station, and the ingredients are right beneath the recipe.  If you need 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar, you'll find a bin of shredded cheddar with a 1/2 cup measuring cup waiting for you.  If you spill something, one of the staff members wipes it up for you!  If you dirty a bowl, it is whisked to the back and washed.  Yes, I pay a bit more to make my family's meals here, but they do all the shopping, all the prep work (chopping, slicing, etc.) and the time savings makes it very worthwhile to me.  The portions are larger than other meal prep kitchens I've tried, and the recipes are very good.  I highly recommend trying Let's Do Dinner.  You'll be glad you did!",5
Restaurants,"i had a prepaid coupon for dinners at this place which say to redeem at 20165 n 67th dr. i drove out there but they were not at that address. the business there gave me a new address of 8976 w union hills and a phone number which i called to verify. their answering service answered and said they are open 11am to 7pm and they were busy and couldn't come to phone. i then drove to this new address only to find the doors locked and nobody there. 
i drove almost 30 miles to get there and spent $11 on gas for nothing not to mention my time of close to 2 hours. so i am sol with what i paid for this coupon and my gas and i have nothing to show for it.
this is no way to run a business.",1
Restaurants,"Food that's almost as convenient as a TV dinner, but fresh and unprocessed.  Everything we've tried so far has varied from great to spectacular.  Top favorites are the soufle and the Greek pork loin, with the whisky steak also well worth a mention.

The idea is great; they put together all the ingredients for a great meal, then you take them home in baggies to either cook fresh or freeze for later use.  The menu changes monthly.  You go to their site, choose your meals and portions, and set a time to pick up your stuff.  It's now much easier to put together an excellent fresh meal at home without spending an hour or two in the kitchen.

Be sure to ask them about their inexpensive veggie trays as an easy side dish.  They are not on the menu, but they usually have some available.",5

Restaurants,"The Silver Spoon Cafe describes itself as ""A warm and inviting bistro cafe at the San Carlos Hotel"". I think this is a pretty good explanation. 

While adventuring in Phoenix some friends and I decided to stop in downtown Phoenix for some lunch. We parked at a parking garage near the Arizona Republic on Van Buren and ventured on from there. Soon we stumbled upon The Silver Spoon Cafe a quaint and affordable lunch spot in The San Carlos Hotel. The cafe itself is pretty small but it also has a outdoor patio which gives the cafe a more secluded and peaceful vibe. The restaurant features a mix of sandwiches, salads, coffee, smoothies, wraps, pastries, desserts, and assorted breakfast items. I ordered the San Carlos Classic which includes roasted turkey, provolone, mayo, lettuce, and tomato on a french baguette. The sandwich also included a pickle and coleslaw. The sandwich was nice and big and tasty. They even made a grilled cheese for one of my friends which wasn't on the menu. She also had a refreshing Tropical Twister smoothie. If you are in the downtown area for breakfast or lunch you can get a yummy meal with a nice atmosphere for the same price as the Subway across the street!",4
Restaurants,"This is a cute little cafe in Phoenix's oldest hotel that serves relatively affordable and tasty lunch fare in a comfortable and friendly environment that looks out onto the streets of downtown. It still amazes me that spots this cozy and cheap can exist in a major city's downtown. To me, that's part of Phoenix's charm.Where else can you work downtown and walk just a block or two from your office tower to have a really nice and affordable lunch in a place quiet enough to have a conversation?

 I took my parents and grandmother here when they were in town last weekend. We found street parking spots after only circling a few times and then lingered over lunch here for an hour or so. I don't remember everything that everyone ordered, but my portobello sandwich was really tasty and my mom's salad (with dried cranberries and crumbled cheese) was really fresh and huge! Five of us ended up eating lunch (along with sodas, a smoothie, and cookie) for only $45 or so, and it was fun to sit by the big glass windows and watch the lunch hour downtown evolve. 

This is a great lunch spot either for people working in the heart of downtown or anyone visiting who wants to see downtown and grab lunch while there.",4
Restaurants,"Silver Spoon Cafe is a little bistro cafe in/under the Hotel San Carlos. I really want to love it, but I don't. I like the idea, I love the location... I just don't really like the food. The couple times I've been , something is always slightly off. Too sweet, too salty, too cold, too chewy, etc. The cashier boy who works in the afternoons is kind of snarky too.. I would give it more of a chance, but like too many other businesses in downtown, Silver Spoon closes its doors at 3pm and isn't open weekends.",3
Restaurants,"I've been to Silver Spoon once, I need to go back to really make the decision if I like it or not.  I went in the summer, it was kinda hot in there-- like most places in the summer but, the heat makes me grumpy.  SO I need to go back when the weather is normal.

I got a salad-- it was massive, a little too much dressing for my liking.  Okay, A LOT of too much dressing but I ate it anyway. 

I'll probably try something else next time.  The staff was nice, the snarky guy that someone mentioned was snarky, buy snarky in a fun loving way, at least that is how I took it.  Snarky can come off all wrong and bad if not done correctly or if you just aren't in the mood for it, or if you yourself is snarky too-- then it's a disaster.  

It's close by my work so the fact that I have not returned makes me keep it at a 3 star review.",3
Restaurants,"My husband and I are visiting Phoenix  from New England. W e wanted to go to Matt's Big Breakfast, but alas they are closed on Mondays. So we wandered around until we found the Silver Spoon.

There are tables outside the restaurant as well as a few tables inside and a counter to order from.   There was a small line inside, so we figured it was a good sign. We both ordered the breakfast burrito with coffee and decided to sit out on the patio area because at 8:00 AM, it was a little cooler outside than inside the restaurant.  

The burritos were quite large! Filled with scrambled eggs,peppers, onions, salsa and cheese. They came with a side of homefries. The home fries were just ok but the burrito was excellent.  The coffee was also good.  The service was also good.

We may be back to try some of the lunch specials. Their menu had a great selection of sandwiches and salads that seemed reasonably priced.",4
Restaurants,"Went in there recently to grab a coffee and my colleague grabbed breakfast. Her food was cheap and looked awesome. I was really excited to try it myself. I came back the next morning with my wife and child. This was a Sunday morning at 8AM. The sign on the door said they were open from 7AM-11AM on Sundays. I was terribly disappointed, and my rating will stay low until I get a chance to go back and try again. Maybe they won't be closed on one of the biggest breakfast mornings of the week (especially when the sign in the window said they would be open!)",2
Restaurants,"I'm not a big breakfast person, but there are times when I get to work and realize that if I don't eat something soon I'm going to crash and burn. This morning was such a day, so I walked over the The Silver Spoon hoping they would have their corned beef hash special. They didn't. So, I asked Jono to suggest something for me and he recommended the breakfast bagel sandwich. Since there was an everything bagel, I got that. And, of course, my meat was bacon. I'm very pleased with the end result and had to take a break from chatting about banking issues to finish this tasty treat.",4
Restaurants,"Service is good, food made in a timely manner.

I'm a vegetarian so only main option is the Mushroom Panini which is fabulous and comes with a pickle and coleslaw.

It is right across the Chase Tower where I'm currently training and will hopefully train in the future so Silver Spoon will be seeing more of me.

Only request would be more vegetarian, healthier, organic options.",4
Restaurants,"Best taqueria in North Vegas, period. Maybe even all of Vegas. I usually go with tres azada tacos , dos de pollo and dos al pastor. Get some guacamole too, which they serve in a styrofoam coffee cup. Wash everything down with a mandarin jarritos mexican soda, and you'll be golden! This place is the bomb, and reasonably priced. Sketchy shopping center though.",5
Restaurants,"The food is great.  My favorite is the carne asada.  Anything you eat will be good, except for any vegetarian adaptations.  I order some bean and cheese tortas because I was not in the mood for meat and one cook made it good while another cook did a horrible job.  I could've done better at home.  If you stick to what is on the menu you should be okay.  The place is really small so if you're claustrophobic or come with a group you should order to go.  Portions are good and everything is fresh right down to the sauces in the mini bar.  Like Mike said, the shopping center is in a bad location so come early.",4
Restaurants,I come here almost every weekend. I love the food! Plus it's inexpensive as well. The food is freshly made. The beans are cooked from scratch. I only get the boiled ones lol! The menudo is a great hit on the weekends. The cooking is consistent since it's the same two cooks from ages ago. On occasion you might see a new cashier.,5
Restaurants,The food is really not good specially since i know what authentic mexican food tastes like. Would not recommend it.,1
Restaurants,"This place is money, anyone who says otherwise is wrong! Al pastor tacos for the win!",5
Restaurants,"My wife got diarrhea pretty bad after eating from this place. The meat was chewy, the rice and beans tasted old and cheap like from a can. Nothing really tasted good except maybe  the fries out of my carne asada fries. I would prefer Robertos to place any day, and I don't like Robertos...",2
Restaurants,Best carne asada in town by far and their al pastor is off the hook! Must try if you are on this side of town,4
Restaurants,"Great tacos, quick service cheap prices. It's tough to find quality lunch options in north town (that aren't Chipotle, Five Guys, etc!), so I'm always happy to hear about any locally-owned joints in the Nellis area. 
The burritos here are really popular, but they're too huge for me, so I stick to the tacos. Steak, carnitas, asada are all delicious, but the standout is definitely the al pastor. If you're in the area, El Tizon is worth a look!",4
Restaurants,I always come here but they got new staff and now the food just taste generic it's sad because I used to spend like 30 bucks a week here I guess those 30 bucks are back in my pocket goodbye tizon hello tacos El Gordo,2
Restaurants,"Consistently great tacos, but you'll drive right past El Tizon if you're not careful.  The tacos are wonderful: hot and fresh.  You can get them individually with your choice of carne asada or chicken (of course), but be especially sure to try the tacos al pastor with everything.  Hungrier than that?  You can also get plates, burritos, nachos, menudo etc.  The menu is surprisingly large for such a small place.

The price is definitely right and the staff is always friendly.  If you work or live on the north east side, be sure to swing by.  El Tizon may just be your new favorite place to grab tacos.  Oh, and your taste buds and wallet will thank you.",4
Restaurants,Best carne asada tacos I've had in Vegas hands down they come with beans! Their chicken tacos are also really good! Amazing customer service. Next time I will add guacamole and cheese to my tacos!,5

In A Sentence™
It's way better than anything else around here. (There ain't much.)

Quick Review™
+   Great location within striking distance of CSN North Las Vegas.

+/- Food is alright. You aren't asking anyone to freeze it and ship it to you via courier service if you are in Antarctica with Cathy C. 

-    Restrooms are atrocious. Worse than the worst truck stop in Arkansas.

Pro Tip: Find it in the CitiTrends, Family Dollar, Super Pawn, O'Reilly Auto Parts-anchored shopping centre, next to Domino's®.

Pro Tip: One of the fast food places that actually have desserts (in the desert). Pide el flancito.

Pro Tip: No hay cerveza. 

It's alright. You get a shitton of food for a relatively small amount of money. No pesos accepted. 

They've always treated me well here. It's a small place; not a lot of non-Spanish speakers coming through. Everyone is welcome though.

Get the pollo or asada. Be kind, rewind. 

No tourists here and that is fine. It's pretty far from the strip after all.

Not good for kids*. (*Unless your kids are Mexican.)

Arts & Entertainment,"Rich Little after all these years is still professional class act!   He is known as the 'man with a hundred voices.'  

I was too young when Rich Little was at the peak of his career in the 1970's and 80's but I remember my loving watching his performances with my Dad on TV.  

When we took a family trip to Las Vegas for a family reunion, my Dad and I got to catch Rich Little's show at the Golden Nugget live.   

He is still amazing!   He can mimic the past 7 U.S. presidents pretty accurately and a host of other celebrities.   ie: Clint Eastwood, Andy Rooney, Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, etc. etc.  

 He comes off as your typical, funny, wise cracking Uncle in your family - except with 10 fold charisma!  

The show was worth every penny.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Just finished seeing Rich Little.  I grew up watching him and thought he did the best impersonations of all the great actors.  It is just amazing to see how he is able to capture everyone's mannerisms.  The show began with clips of Rich and his relationship with Jimmy Stewart.  It really set the context for the great admiration and friendship they had with each other. His impersonation of Johnny Carson was spot on!  Rich took us on a journey of Jimmy Stewart's life and through his impersonations, entertained us with all the great friends that he had.  Wonderful show worth seeing!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Was absolutely amazed, this was one of the best shows I have ever seen in Vegas, surely the best value, never imagined he would still be this good, or should I say great. I have been going to Vegas  for 40 years and it's great to see someone from back in those days this relevant and entertaining still around.",5
Public Services & Government,"The base is located in the Ghetto so that is the negative. But, on the base there are several resources for the AF member and the families. As far as entertainment goes then off base is probably your best bet. They have a BX, commissary, post office, two banks, a hospital, cdc, yc, and two gas stations and many more accommadations such as hotels.",4
Public Services & Government,Great base for Military members!! All the events as well as the Air Show (which you don't need to be military to come too) Is one of my highlights every year!! The people are usually nice but you must slow down while on base... 25 is the max for most areas housing is 15... Also when approaching the gate it is 15mph...they now have radar dectors at the gate...( i know beacuse they told my hubby he was going 35 in a 15 and to slow down) hahaha But yes all in all I love this base and all the activites they offer :D,5
Public Services & Government,"I've been frequenting Nellis AFB since I was a small child. As long as I can remember I've had access to the base because my father is retired military (now). I've seen this base go through many, many changes as Generals have come and gone.

Overall I think the base is pretty nice. They are building a new gym, there's a golf course, pretty good, nothing spectacular though. There is also a bowling center, movies and a few fast food places.

The BX and Shoppette are nicely located and provide decent shopping. The commissary has been remodeled a few times from what I can remember, and it does its job of being a place to get groceries.

I personally enjoy the planes you can walk by and look at by the entrance off of Nellis. Also, you can get discounted tickets to Vegas shows and theme parks from the base which is pretty cool.",4
Public Services & Government,"I love shopping here, much better than the local grocery stores.  This is my main reason for going out here.",4
Public Services & Government,"Great value for us as military retirees! We stayed at the Warrior Inn. Played all three courses at Sun Vista Golf Course and went into town each night to catch a show! A win-win for us!!  

*The beds in the Warrior Inn were beyond uncomfortable! Time to update them!",4
Public Services & Government,"Nellis is a bit of a hike for me, I rarely come here,just for doctor appointments and to visit with friends.

This base however is pretty good, the A&FRC offers support for not only just deployed airmen but to unaccompanied tours as well, which was a big help to me! 

The BX here is really nice, I wish they'd ID more people though, there were a LOT of people that should have not been using the BX, but whatever. I like the furniture store, but in true AAFEES fashion, its over priced and 100$ for delivery. 

The Commisarry is great, if I didn't live closer to Creech, I would shop here more often, maybe as gas prices continue to drop, I'll shop here more often. Great prices for meat and produce. I wish they'd limit the coupons here, these coupon hoarders come through here to clear out shelves.

All in all, this base is one of the better assignments we've had, hopefully more is come!",4
Public Services & Government,"LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG     LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS.   You go in, take a number, see that it's #643 and they just called #417.  I could picture somebody taking numbers and then selling them outside for $3 a pop so people could save time waiting.  I recommend eating at Yassou Greek Grill Cafe and then go and admire the Blue Heron property next door and wish you had $800K to drop on it and then come back in 90 min.  The staff person I spoke with was friendly and helpful.",3
Public Services & Government,"You're going to have to come here sometime- lost your card, name change, new baby in your family? Told you. Be prepared for a long line before the office even opens, so get there early. I knew that there were going to about 35 people in front of me. Bring an iPod, or a magazine or a book to occupy your time- might as well do something while you're waiting. It's like waiting at the DMV, but what else can you do? I think the last time I went here for a name change, it was just under two hours, total.",3
Public Services & Government,"So back in 1986, my parents went to the SSA office to get my brother and I social security numbers. And upon doing so... Wait for it... They put down my date of birth wrong! I went about life just fine until the Real ID Act was implemented. And upon coming to this SSA office for a new SS card, I learned the truth - was I born on the 8th or 9th of September? My parents say the 8th, but the federal gov says the 9th. Thanks mom and dad!

The first wait was horrendous. About two hours worth of waiting. Thankfully, the guy at window 15 was very nice. And instead of making me wait in line all over again the next TWO times over two days I had to come here to get everything all straightened out, he had me just come right back to his window. He remembered me, remembered the issue, and got it all taken care of. (I was, in fact, totally born on the 8th, not the 9th.)

So while the wait is excruciating, the employees (er, at least the one I interacted with) was awesome. So it all evens out to 3 stars (can a gov agency really ever get more than 3 stars anyways?).

If you decide to come right when they open, get here extra EXTRA early. The line starts forming at least an hour before the doors open. When you walk in, you go to a machine, push the appropriate button for the reason for your visit, and take a number. And then the waiting begins...",3
Public Services & Government,"The long wait is terrible.  The guy at window #11 is rude and discriminates.  IT's a 1 hour round trip from where I live to this place.  I came in on Monday this week and took a number at the ticket machine right next to the front door.  I sat at the seat very next to the machine so I never went around to the main lobby area to see the ss applications in the lobby. After waiting for 1 hour, my number is called and I go to window #11.  Guy was so rude and bluntly told me that since I didn't have an application filled out ahead of time ( I didn't know that I needed a appliction for a replacement card) that I needed to get another number and get back into line.  So I just took an application and went home planning to come the next day because I didn't want to wait.  I came back yesterday (Tuesday) and sat in the main lobby area this time.  I saw the same guy working at window #11 again.  Then I saw a lady come to his window who also didn't have an application filled out.  He let her go over to the application stand and waited until she filled it out and he let her come back to his window!  How unfair was that!  I had to make 2 one hour round trips to this place because the guy at the window wouldnt let me fill it out at his window!  He completely discriminates and is totally rude. When I approached him and called him out about it yesterday, he denied it and threathened to call security.  So readers of Yelp, make sure you get in line early and watch out for rude guy at window #11.",1
Public Services & Government,Arrived today 8:54 am. Forty fifth in line for SS cards. Out by 9:30am. Much better than expected. Upon leaving there were no lines outside.,3
Public Services & Government,"One of the longest and slowest lines I have ever encountered. The wait hellish and makes the DMV feel like a day in the park. The cold room feels drab and a sense of despair hangs in the air. If I didn't know any better, I swear INS was waiting outside to deport people. With way too many people coming in and not enough seating, people were lingering outside the door and in the rocks. After an excruciatingly long wait, we got up to the desk and were quickly dealt with.",3
Public Services & Government,Quick service to obtain you're social security card.,4
Public Services & Government,"Strangely, the people behind the counter are nice and personable. At least the one I dealt with. The security guard is a terrible. Wont even make eye contact when asked a question. I was so insulted, I made him repeat his answer. The system is cool. You go to a computer, check off what you are there for and you get a #. A large TV screen on either side of the room tell you what # they are on. All in all, I was in and out in less than 45 minutes! The girl behind the counter was great. The people going in and out leave A LOT to be desired. WOW! All I have to say is.....WOOOOOOOW!",3
Public Services & Government,"I am impressed with this location! My boyfriend and I were in need of replacement social security cards so we came here expecting a lousy process to do so. We were happily surprised as they have a separate office who only handles the cards! We input our info in a kiosk that printed out a number, filled out a replacement application and were called up. We were in and out in less than 20 minutes and this was on a Friday!

The office was nice, clean and air conditioned so the short wait was a breeze. We got a receipt and will have our new social security cards mailed out in 5-10 days. Social security cards are no charge and you are allowed up to 3 per year and a maximum of 10 per lifetime lol. 

This is the only location in the valley that handles cards so don't waste your time and go elsewhere like we did the first time, see other review!",4
Public Services & Government,"It took 2 hours to be seen, but the clerk was certainly friendly and helpful and got me out of there in less than 10 minutes.",3
Public Services & Government,"It is what it is: a long, boring wait until they call your number and then they're done with you in 2 minutes. Very anticlimactic. Helpful tips:
- Don't go at lunch. This will cause you to be at the SSA for 2.5 hours. 
- Take a book or something to occupy your time. 
- Don't take your children, it only creates a more hostile environment. 
- Help everyone out and learn what you should bring prior to showing up and fill out all necessary paperwork that can be printed off the website. Makes things go quicker.",3
Public Services & Government,For being Social Security they have Nothing for handicap access other than a button to open the door (going in only!!) the wait time is outrageous and the staff is just uninterested and bored with their job. One of the worst offices I have been in.,1
Public Services & Government,"I have dealt with this office for two different issues.  The first my x filed for Disability and really his attorney did all the work I just went in the end and signed my twins up and had no issues, Easy end of story. He however dealt for over 1 1/2 years.  This last month my youngest daughter's father died and I'm dealing with them.  I had never put his name on her birth Cert., but had court orders of DNA among other things.  The man paid child support for her life.  Nothing was good enough.  I have paid hundreds of dollars in babysitting going down there to wait to bring additional court papers.  The state knows and believes he is her father.  When I asked for her help what she would accept when I was unable to provide her with DNA testing since the Judge has them and they are with Millions of other paperwork to be scanned in for there paperless system she would not help or even try to find out.  I would finally fax court documents to her when I ran out of money to pay for babysitting and transportation and she would not call me back,  I then started calling supervisors every 3 to 4 days they never called back.  This went on for over a month.  I had to seek an attorney's help to know what to do and file a document through the court and before I could get it to them they denied my daughter's claim.  I tried to tell them what I was doing but again they did not care they denied her claim.  I made one comment to the case worker because she was shutting down everything I brought her.  It made her mad so she shut me down.  These workers hide behind the federal guards in there AND because they can hide behind the guards and have no one to answer to they get away with poor customer service and not doing the job they were hired to follow through with in a professional manner.  My daughter is paying that price.  But soon when the complaint is filed and the it gets out the Valley will know as well.  They have to start answering for there actions and stop hiding behind the federal guards that work there.  They are there to protect from the crazy people that harm in there not the people that are being served badly in there, so maybe those guards are to blame too?  I don't know.",1
Public Services & Government,"This place had a longer wait time then the dmv at noon. You feel as though something aweful is in here, just despair oozing out of people's pores as they wait for hours. Oddest thing is once you get up to a window, it only takes about 2 minutes.  A must if you need a new or replacement card in Clark County",3
Public Services & Government,This office is GREAT!  Its easy to find- well laid out - and I was really lucky I guess because I was in and out in less than 30 minutes.  I went on a Wednesday morning at 9 and was in my car driving away at 9:33.  They have a stand up desk to fill in your application and it takes about 5 minutes.  Then you sit down and wait for them to call your number. Lady was nice enough.  It was painless.,4
Public Services & Government,I came here for a name change a few months back. I was expecting to sit and wait all day as that's how it is at the social security offices in California...surprisingly though without an appointment I was serviced pretty quickly! They have a very clean and large waiting area. Large enough that you can have empty seats around you.,4
Public Services & Government,"My experience was not so great. Don't get me wrong the facility is nice and kept clean but the lines are ridiculous.  They have 19 windows but only have 5 windows open.  What the heck? That doesn't make any sense to me knowing that it's a federal facility. You know there are programs that calculate the amount of people who come in and out of the facility so I don't understand why they can't staff accordingly!!!  

They also don't have enough seats available.  Many people were standing up and of course this makes people grumpy and cranking. Please consider adding more seats or rearranging the wait area.

After the long wait we at least got a nice staff member who helped us out so I'm grateful they weren't a jerk who gives snippy attitude.  They were helpful so that is what bumped up the rating.

My advice, go earlier and have breakfast first!",2
Public Services & Government,"This is a government office, so of course there are going to be long wait times, but once my number was called things went swimmingly!

I recently got married and I needed to head to the SSA office to change my name on my social security card. I looked it up online so I knew what they needed from me to change my name and I printed and filled out the application online. So, other than the wait time, once I got up to the window, she took about 7 minutes to stamp a piece of paper and hand it to me saying ""you'll receive your new card in 2 weeks"".

Sweet! Thank you very much, buh-bye now!",4
Public Services & Government,The DMV has it more organized than this place with much larger crowds.  The only reason I give it two stars is the worker we had was super helpful and fast once we got there.,2
Public Services & Government,"19 windows and just a few that are open.  How lame is that?!  I was expecting like a DMV wait, thankfully they are going through the numbers a little quicker.  It's the day after Christmas so perhaps that is why it is not as busy.  

I made the mistake of going into the wrong office first, so luckily, my husband asked.  When you check in, make sure you go to the self service to get your number first and then wait like a couple hours later to be called, ha! I would eat prior to coming here because for as long as you have to wait, your tummy might be growling.  

Fill out your app here, or go online prior.",2
Public Services & Government,"I went in expecting the worst, and was partially right, lol. There are two separate offices, so I went to the office regarding dealing with Social Security cards. 

I was sure to have all of my documents ready, filled out my application online and printed it to take with me that day at 8AM. I waited in line for 1 hour outside, then waited 2 more inside until they finally called my number, only 6 windows were open! When it was finally my turn, the woman behind the counter tells me that I needed another document. So the next day, I return with the new document that I needed, and when the gentleman calls my number, he informs me that I DIDN'T need that new document after all!! =/",2
Public Services & Government,"This place is so small to be serving all of Las Vegas. There are not enough seats for everyone. There are so many windows & they only use like 5. 

There is no information desk. That makes me mad because I could have saved my last 3 visits & almost 6 total hours if there was one. 

Most of the employees behind the counter are not friendly & seem kind of careless..",3
Public Services & Government,"This office was super easy to find.  I lost my SS card so came for a replacement. I filled out the application online and printed it off before coming. The first office is for other ss docs while the second, not suite 150, is for ss cards. As soon as you walk in the kiosk is there to sign in and get your number. Seating is limited but when I showed up at 2:00 p.m. most seats were open. They close at 3:30 so if you aren't in by then, good luck. (A huge rush of people came in at 3).

They were on A688 when I showed up. I ended up waiting for an hour before they called my number (A752). It wasn't a bad wait at all as long as you have something to occupy your time. I got to the window, gave the lady my application and ID and was out in 2 minutes. It'll be 2 weeks before I get my card in the mail, but the people were friendly and place was clean.  No complaints here!",5
Public Services & Government,Two other offices in Vegas: North Las Vegas (Craig and Simmons) and Henderson (Eastern south of St Rose parkway)....,5
Public Services & Government,"Considering the last time I went to a SS office, it was in North town in the HOOD, I can NOT complain about my most recent experience. A new location (well not new, but not the old one that Vegas natives are use to) at Buffalo and Charleston. I hear the parking lot fills up but I had no issues getting a spot in the lot. 
I went at about 11am on a Monday. My expectations were not at all high. I was planning on waiting, and even told my daughter to bring headphones or something to read.
We were number 204, and they were calling 116. Great, about 100 people in front of me. As I scrambled to find a seat in the sea of unhappy people I notice they were already at 122 and had about 8-10 windows open. A glimmer of hope. 
Within 40 minutes in the super uncomfortable metal chairs, I was about 5 numbers away. 
The gentleman I dealt with was very helpful and kind. He answered all my questions as I was there for a card replacement but it was under very odd circumstances. I was at the counter about 20 minutes when most were out in 5-10. However the pleasantness of the staff did not bring any impatience at all. 
The security looked useless and confused. Had anyone actually brought a gun, or started a fight, I am not too sure they would be able to control the situation. They are more there for presence or to answer silly questions. 
Overall, I did not have a bad time at all. No one enjoys coming to a place like this, but they stepped their game up. So I will take it in stride and enjoy! Sorry for those who had to wait hours, I can see how that could be possible, guess I got lucky.",4
Public Services & Government,"I can only speak for the card services side, the benefits side was mobbed and looked pretty miserable. Thankfully, someone called out that card services were next door, so we quickly ran over there. 

My girlfriend needed a replacement card, and we pulled a number that was about 25 from the current number. It wasn't that crowded, and they went really quick, only maybe a 15 minute wait. 

The woman that helped us was really great, and made the process so smooth. Typically you're worried something crazy is going to happen, or mistakes are made, etc. This lady made sure everything was handled quickly, and we were out the door in like 5 minutes 

Great and fast service, exceeds expectations when thinking about government!",4
Public Services & Government,"I'm not sure what all of the fuss is about. I came to this location for a duplicate social security card. I came prepared with required documents. 
Location was easy to find and the parking lot was pretty full. Monday 1245. I walked into the highly air conditioned room and pulled my ticket then found where the applications were and filled one out, noticing how packed the place was I got discouraged. I walked to my car filled it jot and came back in, standing against the wall until a seat opened. 
They were calling numbers extremely fast to my surprise, about a number a minute. I pulled my ticket at 1245 and left at 2pm. I was expecting a long wait but this was nothing! The man who helped me was extremely quick, just typed in the computer and gave me my receipt. 
Obviously places like these (including dmv) aren't going to be a joyous trip, but I was pleasantly surprised at the fast pace!",5
Public Services & Government,"Window 5 your are so funny, you didn't even look at my papers like they were poop.  I was in & out in less than 30 minutes.    Keep up the good work.",5
Public Services & Government,"After driving by one day and seeing the line, I started searching online for advice on when to go. I was so happy I checked yelp to see there are actually two doors. Suite 150 is benefits, and the door to the left (Suite 100 I think) is for cards. The cards side is about half as busy as the benefits side.

Since they open at 9am, I decided to just show up at 7:45am and camp outside on a Wednesday. I brought a towel, book, and a bottle of water. Some people brought pop-up tailgating/camping chairs. I was number 5 in line showing up that early. Not many people came after me - maybe 3 people? It wasn't until 8:20am when more people started showing up steadily, then around 8:45am in masses. By the time they opened at 9am, the line was around the building. If you show up right when they open, you'll be standing outside a while. It's not because there aren't chairs inside, but the machines you check into right when you walk in the door create a very slow moving line to get inside. 

I was walking back to my car at 9:07am, so my wait time was 75 minutes. The folks you're in line with will provide plenty of entertainment for you. The guy next to me who kept using a piece of paper as his telephone and talking to himself about how he's hungry and wants to grill himself ""one of them anaconda snakes,"" made me want to start a live tweet from the Social Security Office. People were still checking in to get numbers when I was leaving and squeezing past them. The benefits side was a zoo.

It's the typical government office wait, and it sucks. It's totally a one star thing. However, since there seems to be some sort of benchmark set for waiting, everything else ran smoothly. I came prepared with my paperwork filled out and more ID than you could possibly imagine. Around 8:30/8:45am, someone actually came outside and passed applications for a card out to the line.They opened promptly and started calling numbers. The security guards directed people as they moved inside to get their number, talking pretty sternly and authoritatively which helped move people quickly. The window I got was nice and efficient, did what I needed, and got me out quickly.",3
Public Services & Government,"I needed to change my status with Social Security. This place is pretty far from me but I honestly heard really negative things about the other locations so I decided it would be worth the drive. This is place is pretty quick. Theres two entrances. The first door you see walking from the parking lot is where you line up for the Social Security Benefits. That line gets really long so come early! The second door you see is for just Social Security Card related inquiries. That line was pretty much non existent compared to the other line when I arrived at 9:30am. When you get inside there is a little computer where you can get your number so don't just sit down right away. Don't forget a grab a number! 

I honestly had no issues with this place up until I went up to a security guard to ask a simple question that needed just a simple answer, but what I got was a unappreciated, unnecessary, exaggerated answer. He replied to me in which he thought I was a little uneducated girl that did not know how to follow directions. I simply replied with, ""Sir it was just a question the unnecessary attitude isn't needed."" How rude. I over heard him talking to other people the same way. It's like, you work at a Social Security Office, Yes there will be repetitive questions but answer them accordingly. Acting like we are a bunch of idiots isn't going to make your job any better. 

Lady at the desk was very helpful though & she is a Breast Cancer Survivor. Extra star just for her! 

Other than that, if I had any issues with Social Security, I will defiantly return to this location for the lack of waiting time.",3
Public Services & Government,"Think thats bad? we adopted a child and had his name changed, I went down to the one on s. buffalo blvd. in Las Vegas, Nv, waited forever, finally got my number called, went up their with the original of everything i could think of only to be told I had to mail it in and not politely either, Miss Thang should be happy to have the job she has!! My first mistake I went home and made copies of everything I had mailed it in only to get it returned telling me they needed original copies, well got all the originals together ( Keeping copies for my records) now they want my original drivers license or ssi card.  First if I mail my original driver license id in what happens if I get pulled over or need my license?  This is probably why foster homes have a hard time adopting children, then government make it to hard for people who would love to have children to get them and probably why c.p.a. continues to give the children back that they take from these unfit parents.   Wish me luck, think I will send my original ssi card in....  Thanks SSI for taking a pleasurable moment of life to make it so rough on the people who is there to help.
then to top it all off i only have so many days to get it done in and now I am down to 4 days.",1
Public Services & Government,"Finally decided to correct my Social Security card with the right DOB (guess it's been 1 day off since I was 12), and thanks to Stephanie K for directing me to the 2nd door furthest from the parking lot - guess it's pretty common for people to walk into the first door (benefits). The process was relatively quick and painless, I probably shouldn't have put it off for so many years since replacement cards are free.

Note that the benefits office closes at 3, but the cards side is open till 3:30pm and you just need to be in the door by then. My strategy for places like this is to go right before closing since they want you out as quickly as possible. Going by the numbers, there were about 40 people ahead of me but the line moved pretty quickly - I was out within about maybe 45 minutes, so going on your lunch hour is doable at least. 

Office is depressing as hell, but it's clean w/ a lot of seating. There are guards on site and they were surprisingly needed to kick out a very angry lady and her elderly dad. I'm really not sure what could possibly piss you off at the cards office, but the guards were actually good at calming her down and let them back in eventually. They also made the 2 morons blasting youtube crap on their phone turn it off speaker, so yay for that.",3
Public Services & Government,"I had applied for benefits for my daughter and I was dealing with Mrs. Knudson who I found to be a truly awesome lady and after my first month she informed me she had to give my case over to another social worker named Tammy. 

While dealing with Tammy at first she seemed alright, now I feel she doesn't know how to help people correctly. I leave message after message and I never receive a call back like I did with Mrs. Knudson, I have to call the main phone number for social security and try to get a hold of someone and I have to wait on hold for over half hour and or it will say call back later without getting anyone. 

I also was told by Tammy, my daughters benefits would only change if I made over 3400 in a month which I never made that much in a month I made way less, so my daughters benefits dropped out of no where and when Tammy calls back she leaves a pointless message on my cell and doesn't even tell me why my daughter had her benefits cut or why she lost partial benefits... 

What we need in this office is diligent workers not people who claim they call back and don't or give crappy messages that make no sense. YES it is my fault for not picking up the cell and answering Tammy, but I also deal with doctors for my daughter.",3
Public Services & Government,"1. Its a government office, expectations start at 0. 
2. On a decent side of town. 
3. Surprisingly quick, I think there were about 20 windows, maybe 15 open.  
4. I saw an air force guy come in and he got to skip the line...always nice to show military appreciation.
5. People from every span of life, including homeless and babies, and i didn't see any porters or maids, lesson: bring hand sanitizer. 
All in all, I hope i never need to go back here, but if i had to its cool.",3
Public Services & Government,Drove in had front parking!  Picked a number and within 15 minutes we were called and done with getting a duplicate SS Card.  FYI nice clean bathroom :),5
Public Services & Government,"I'm sooooo glad I looked here on Yelp, before heading out to the SS office a lil closer me!! There WAS a line....but NOT to get just a SS Card. The other Yelpers were right...see suite 100!! I was in and out...in about 20 minutes!!! YAY!!!",5
Public Services & Government,"The security people are the most rude, disrespectful, egomaniacal jerks ever born...They love to hassle people when they are bored and push their weight around to feel better about themselves.  It is bad enough that you have to wait forever for services without these mean people there to harass patrons...In a city of 2 million people there needs to me more than one place to get a card...insane.",1
Public Services & Government,"Be prepared to have your information lost and you pay for it, I had to redo paperwork, because they suck and lost it. Then now they lost my wages I turned in using their envelopes and paperwork and still they can't get it right. I called up and due to the fact I work from 7AM to 3PM Monday through Friday I am unable to take off, because of work, so I called up and some guy named Chris is a punk ass who did not listen did not help, but hung up when I was explaining how many times I have called to speak to my social worker and I have left over 4 messages for a lady named Tammy, if you get her good luck with a response. 

They want everyone to come in and not pick up a phone. If anyone gets the fact that some people just can't up and leave work to sit for hours at a time for bullshit service and need money for bills then you'll understand why you have no choice, but to call. Some jobs won't let you leave unless you're willing to find other work else where! 

Now I see why people fight in here and or attack their social workers lol, because they are shitty ass people who work here and can't seem to get it right. I am far from attacking anyone, but I am just saying I see why now, because the last time I was here I heard the yelling and over heard why the person literally attacked the social worker I now see why!",2
Public Services & Government,"The screens were all DOWN, only 5 windows were OPEN, there is NO information desk, the security ""officers"" and I use officers very loosely were rude, condescending, and rarely got off their behinds to help ANYONE. The minute you get there you have Obama phone people bothering everyone literally 2 people per door outside of each entrance /exit to get private information in exchange for a free phone.  It was sad having to watch security  treat the elderly, disabled, and non English speakers like garbage. I'm sorry but people who are severely disabled shouldn't have to seek you out for help when trying to find the benefits side that is your job. When the only people who are doing their jobs correctly with decency are the tellers/ people behind the glass. That was the only positive thing.I understand there will be a wait, it's a government building so my expectations were not high but at least have things more organized and hire security officers who make people feel safe not like an inconvienence.",1
Public Services & Government,this is the new ss card office they are very fast for the amount of people who come in.  Very efficiant too!,4
Public Services & Government,"Warning: to anyone getting married and changing your name here, you cannot make your MAIDEN name your MIDDLE without going to court. This is per NAC 483.055 (it took me forever to find) and it is rather recent.

I filled out my application prior with my maiden name as my middle. I gave the SSA worker all of my stuff, and she handed me a paper saying my new ss card would be mailed to me. Quick and easy, right? I looked at the paper she handed me and it had my middle name as my middle, not the maiden name I asked for. I immediately brought it to her attention and she said I could not use my maiden as my middle without a court order or something. Ok, so that is the case I had then learned... But TELL ME before you go ahead and change my name!!! I would not have gone through with changing it! 

Otherwise, the office was fine. I arrived about 20 mins before they opened. There was a line out the door. It moved quickly. Honestly I think I may been better getting there a half hour or so after they opened. I thought this was going like the DMV... thankfully it was not!",3
Public Services & Government,"Security guards don't secure anything, they are smartasses! I waited for 2 hours, tried to sit down on one of the chairs , they told me I wasn't aloud too, but there was no sign to say I couldn't, I have a broken foot & have crutches! No drinks aloud? Stupid. DMV is more efficient & they know what they are doing! This office needs some tips from the DMV",1
Public Services & Government,"Let me start by saying everyone in this office is amazing, mrs Staples is an angel from heaven. But I have been treated like dog waste by the security guard  there on 3 separate occasions. He has gone as far as treating me by placing his hand on his gun and saying now what. I think maybe he hates white people. He is extremely rude to many that I have observed. This last trip I was asked by a very nice lady helping me to get some info. She explained that I should step away from the window and she would call me back when I was ready. So I did! The little twerp with glasses started yelling at me to move, so I did but I said you don't have to yell at me. He stated that if I listened he wouldn't have to yell. I had already complied. Yet he called for back up and made me leave. I'm not really a violent or angry person but he decently brings out my worst. I am truly sad to say people like him are the reason this country has a racial problem.",1
Public Services & Government,"Two offices co-located: 

Card Center opens Mon-Fri from 9AM to 4PM. The paper receipt from the DMV is not proof of ID to receive an SS card. If you don't have another valid government ID (not expired), then it's best to wait for your driver license to arrive.

District Office (benefit office) MTThF 9AM-4PM. Closes at 12 noon on Wednesdays. Can file for retirement and disability online (SSA.GOV)

Best time to get a Social Security card is Wednesday afternoon. Everyone thinks both offices are closed then,  but only the benefit office is closed,  not the Card Center.

Most questions can be answered on the phone: 800-772-1213.",5
Public Services & Government,"I have had to come here on several occasions and I myself prefer to get in line before the office opens. 

There is a public sidewalk where one or two people will preach fire and brimstone over a  bullhorn, which can be quite annoying -especially when people aren't in a position to walk away and is an unfortunate situation for those who would rather not listen to an improtu sermon. 

Frankly, if I wanted to hear a sermon I'm sure I could easily find a church that could accommodate my request if that is what I were to be seeking.

The service here is a typical Social Security where it is often filled to the gills with people needing name changes, social security cards for children, and other miscellaneous issues.",3
Public Services & Government,"This place would be a perfect if it weren't for the fact that you get treated like a criminal by the security guards. This is my second time to this office and the second time the same guards have treated us like trash. 

I'm just here to celebrate my marriage by changing my name, I could care less how long the wait or how crowded the building. This could have been a pleasant experience except for the fact that the staff here act like they are employed at Alcatraz.

Public Services & Government,"My wife and I came in to get her signed up for Medicare part B (she's on disability). We took every piece of paperwork with us that we could think of.

Having read some of the previous reviews, we were a little apprehensive about the security guards, long waits, rude people, etc. I have to say that we were treated in a very professional manner from the minute we walked in the door (greeted by 2 security guards) to when we spoke with the guy who gives out the numbers. We found out that we had taken the correct paperwork, gave it to the guy who gives the numbers, and he smiled and said ""thanks, you're all done"".

The guards wished us a good day as we left. Total time spent: under 10 minutes.

My advice (worth what you paid for it): take every piece of paperwork with you that you can think of. Fill it all out ahead of time.",4
Public Services & Government,"Went in out a Tuesday around 1. Wasn't a fan that there's only 1 parking lot & you have to find the entrance of  building 100. After the nice little walk I had abut 50 people in front of me. Wait wasn't that bad at all, under an hour. 

I kinda wish the wait was longer because the people that go in there are a mess. The security guard clearly didn't like children because he got on to kids for screaming and running, jumping etc. I say he didn't like them because of his tone. Even tho the parents should really be the ones telling the kids to behave. Oh, and the guard wasn't scared to get into lowkey arguments with people that came in & asked questions about where they should go. He's really good at smart remarks. 

The guy that helped me was um.. Odd to say the least. No social skills whatsoever which really confused me. 

Anyways, decent waiting times, mean security guard, and great for people watching. 

I hope my boyfriend losses his Social so I can have a chance to go back and watch the train wreck of people.",4
Public Services & Government,"While the Friday I was there, the security guard told me it was actually a ""slow"" day, I still waited 2.5 hours until my ticket number was announced. 

Back up. When I arrived I stood in line outside in the breezy chilly morning until I finally was able to get inside, only to still stand in line to get a ticket at the ticket kiosk. 
Getting the ticket and luckily finding a metal chair seat against the wall, I settled in for my wait, half enjoying the people watching. Why I was there with my daughter to obtain her social security card so she can take the driving permit test, it appeared others were there for other security card related reasons. 
Finally after my number was called, we jumped up as if to yell ""Bingo!"" in delight, we sat at window 14. Appearing behind the window was a glass is half full kind of guy, our clerk was friendly and easy going. He patiently waited for me to pull out the plethora of papers I had brought in fear of not having enough or the right paperwork. He issued both my kids their new cards and when I'd mentioned I thought I'd misplaced mine, he kindly filled out an application for a card for me. Nice customer service! 
Hope to never have to return to Social Security office because the wait, along with the smells, I can do without!",4
Public Services & Government,"Came here today to get a new social for my newborn son. Parents know how precious time out is, having to lug around multiple kids. Well the guy working booth number 5 younger gentleman with a black beard clean cut hair- you need to slow your roll and pay attention to the documents we bring you. They don't accept birth certificates and He kept on telling me he doesn't accept documents from the hospital and I told him I got something from the dr. And he kept saying no documents from the hospital. I pulled an immunization paper I got from my dr But he said it has to be stamped. So I went down to my dr to get my sons immunization record and what do you know!!!!!!!!! It was the same damn document. Not only did you waste my time but gas also I live on the south side of town.

So parents of children trying to get a social security card. If you call the 899 social security number they will tell you birth certificates are ok but it's not and be sure to Bring your immunization records stamped.",1
Public Services & Government,"Four months after getting married, I decided it was finally time for me to file my name change.  

Friday morning, my husband and I got up super early, and made the journey down to the Social Security Administration building.  

We arrived at 6:50am.  Yes.  I know that it doesn't open until 9:00 AM.  I had made the conscious decision to get there as early as possible to wait outside, to alleviate the need to spend ALL DAY there.  

I chose wisely. 

We were the first in line for the card services (suite 100).
We waited patiently, and at about 8:45, the door opened, and a VERY rude security guard thrust a packet of papers at us, practically shouting:  ""These are applications for new cards.  Take one and pass them back.  and YOU need to move the line to the other side of this door so you don't block the other door!""

Slow down there, guy.  I understand that you probably hate your job, but being rude to people who haven't done anything but stand on the wrong side of the door isn't the best way to start the day.  Perhaps if you all had signs up, indicating which side of the doors you wanted the line to start?  There were NO signs.  There was very little signage period:  several people had stood in the wrong line for an hour or more.  I was about to start charging people to answer questions about which door was for cards and which was for benefits.

When they let us in, the security guard was standing there barking questions at us: ""Did you fill out the application?""  Yes.  3 months ago online, and I have it here.  He directed me to the window I was to go to, but barely moved out of my way.  

Dude.  You're not a cop.  You're a security guard.  Stop acting like such a dictator with something to prove.  Be nice, and people will be nice to you.  And don't be a bully and not move out of the way so people can go where you tell them.  Do you think you're going to be rushed or something?    

Once inside, the process was quick and painless, and the lady I worked with was very nice. We were done within 3 minutes.  

Hopefully I will never have to come back...but if I do, I hope someone brings the security guy some coffee and doughnuts.  Maybe he'll be in a better mood and be nicer.",2

There is a check in kiosk to get your number in line. 40 numbers away after checking in and took 35 minutes to get our number.  Not too shabby.

I was expecting the worst but turned out to be pretty painless.",4
Public Services & Government,"I've had the need on two occasions to come to this office.  Both times were quite easy and I avoided the lines by having an appointment that I made over the phone.

In that case, you can skip the line outside and go directly to the window and someone will call your name at the appointment time.  

The only problem I had this time was the parking.  There are so many people at the office that you have to keep circling until you see someone backing out and you lay claim to that spot.

The two staff members with whom I interacted--several years apart--were knowledgeable, pleasant, and efficient at their jobs.",4
Public Services & Government,"This was the second time I've had to use this social security office.  Absolutely worst experience I have ever had at any govt office.  Most unfriendly and organized place I've ever been to.  20 windows and only 5 of them open.  It's a shame that all of these govt facilities treat people like shit.

The officers are rude and treat people like crap.  I sat there for over three hours to get a replacement SS card.

Not that this review will do much good but if you can do things a different way, please do!  The worst of the worst sitting in there.  Not one open seat, and the place over capacity.  Smells, and is just horrible!",1
Restaurants,"Your regular small casino bar. Interesting people and a smaller selection of drinks. They also have one of those 1/2 yard drinks.

Found this place during our St. Patty's bar crawl of the strip. Located right between the Venetian food court and the shops with the gondola rides. Beers were cold but most of their selection is bottled. Price wasn't too bad from what I remember lol.",3
Restaurants,"Heaven in a martini glass is a pineapple sorbet-tini at very Venice. Made with pineapple sorbet infused with alcohol (I'm guessing rum on this one), you get a big ball of pineapple sorbet (so delicious) in some rum. 

They also have other flavors like watermelon and lemon, but the bartender recommended the pineapple. So glad I did, it hit the spot!

And by the way, this was my first drink of the night which means it really did taste good, it wasn't just something I chugged in a drunken casino stupor, although I did yell ""OMG WHAT'S A SORBETINI?!"" :)",5
Restaurants,"Nice place just to grab a drink, we always come here to get drinks and they make them good!",4

It was a great experience along with a great vacation it was a pleasure seeing people who care about their work and were more than friendly. I hope they stay around for my next trip to Las Vegas, I am a definite repeat customer!",5

Restaurants,"This is a small little bar in the Venetian and they had a great little happy hour. They had $2 drafts, which sounds great, but their only draft was PBR. They also offered $2 shots (not specialty shots but basic shots of liquor), and buy one get one free well drinks ($8, so kind of like $4 each). They had 2 TV's but one of them kept freezing up.",4
Restaurants,"Ordered a dry dirty gin martini. Very good. My wife ordered a lemon drop which tasted like a lemon rind. She being a bartender herself, was disappointed. Our bartender absolutely ignored us for her sugar daddy sitting at the bar. It's ok. We had our cocktail and now off to see Rock of Ages.",1
Restaurants,Bartender Angie was amazing!!!! She really made the experience great. She was very friendly and her drinks were all soooo delicious. You could tell she really enjoyed her job and it for sure showed. We stopped at the bar for one drink and ended up staying for a couple more JUST because of her.

Restaurants,"PATTY the bartender with the short hair, yellow teeth, and stank attitude needs to be fired ASAP.  Came here with my boyfriend and our friends and had a horrible experience. We sat down and pretty much was ignored by the bartender. When she finally approached us for our order, we asked what specials she had for happy hour. She responded ""pabst,"" without even mentioning the wine specials.  My boyfriend ordered a Heineken and she asked for his ID which I had in my purse since it was a passport.  I was pulling it out and she kept rudely asking my boyfriend for it saying ""if u don't show it to me now, you need to get up.""  She literally didn't even give me 10 seconds to pull it out.  After her rude response I asked her ""Are you ok? Having a bad day?""  We ended up leaving because she was so darn rude, almost as if she was racist. We asked for her name and she said ""patty, but I don't work here."" Someone train this lady customer service.",1
Restaurants,"I didnt have a pleasant experience with the bartender Pattie. She came off rude and very uninterested in serving me or my party. Looked like is could of been a quick place to grab a cold beverage and possibly a snack??

$100.00 or so slid right out the door due to the service we received. Wont be returning",1
Restaurants,"When all the restaurants and pubs are closing, where can you go for drinks? Some of the little drink booths and bars scattered around inside the connecting malls are gems in their own little ways. We hit up the Very Venice Bar when most other restaurants and pubs were closing down. This place also seemed to be closing for the evening but the bartender was more than willing to serve us a few drinks and have a bit of pleasant conversation while she cleaned up. She didn't rush us or make us feel unwelcome at all. A few other patrons were also finishing off their drinks at this location as well.

Nothing overly fancy in menu: well drinks, beer on tap and in bottles, some wine options. We were there mostly to just top off our last few drinks for the evening so we were keeping it simple with mandarin and soda.",4
Public Services & Government,"I have mixed feelings about this department. Once, a couple of pit bulls ended up in our backyard (twice this happened). They were nice dogs, but since we have two dogs of our own, we could not have them wait for pickup inside our home. We ended up waiting for animal control to pick up these dogs, about four or five hours- which tied up our day. We had them secured in another area, away from our dogs. 

We are responsible pet owners (pick up their feces regularly- this is what we do, when we walk our dogs in public, at parks or around our neighborhood) as well as considerate neighbors. When we had complaints, we found a solution. But alas, we have inconsiderate neighbors who had five small loud barking dogs, at one point (it's illegal- you have to have a breeder's license now). When there were complaints about them, they claimed that they did not speak English. They've gone down to two dogs, however, they leave them outside in the backyard to bark all hours of the night. I can't tell you how many times they've done so- that's how frequent (and it so happens to be right outside our bedroom window where their dogs are kept). (When we first moved in, over five years ago, these same neighbors had two huge turkeys, ducks, and more than a dozen chickens and roosters- this is illegal in Las Vegas city limits. If you're in an area marked ""Horse Property"" I think that area of the city is fine with these kinds of animals.) These are the same neighbors who will do handywork in their yard at 6:30 am- I think they believe that other people in the neighborhood are up that early on weekends (or maybe they don't care about the noise ordinance law- 7am-10 pm).

Here's a summary of the process: complaints are recorded, two complaints are given to the offender, before going to court to file officially. I haven't gone down farther in the process so I will keep you posted. The number (for complaints) posted online is not the correct telephone number- for Las Vegas call 229-6444 (OPTION 2), for North Las Vegas call 633-1390, and Henderson call 267-4970.

Noisy animals are misdemeanor violations which if witnessed by an Animal Control Officer may result in the issuance of a citation and criminal prosecution of the owner. Should an Animal Control Officer issue a citation for a noisy animal the complainant's name will be listed on the citation as the affected party and you will be required to testify in court to the habitual nature of the noise. This is also why we suggest that you speak to these parties and try to work together as neighbors before filing a noisy animal complaint. We would suggest that you try to resolve this with your neighbors. It is only with your cooperation a case can go forward towards resolution.
 
If Animal Control is unable to witness the violation the complaint will be forwarded to the Neighborhood Justice Center for mediation. Should mediation fail to resolve the problem you will be provided with a District Attorney's packet. In most cases a letter is sent by the District Attorney's Office prior to filing a Criminal Complaint to bring this matter into court. This process also requires the corroboration of two neighbors to process the Criminal Complaint.",3
Public Services & Government,We called in a pitbull running around in the park no owners. Tried to keep an eye on its location for when animal control showed up. Upon the mans arrival me b my husband told him where it was and that the animal seemed frightened. Not one word was said from the man or acknowledgement that we were speaking to him. Very very rude person! If he treats people this way I cant imagine how he treats animals.,2
Public Services & Government,"first of all I don't understand why you have to be listed on the complaint.  you should be able to report excessive barking dogs in a HOA neighborhood anonymously without fear of your neighbors you are reporting, able to seek revenge, its a crazy world out here and you just never know how someone will react.     There is a pitbull that is constantly barking in our HOA community and the HOA is not doing anything about it even though its a rule violation and I cannot report this dog to animal control because I have to be listed on the citation.   This department needs to relook at the way barking dogs can be reported without harm to the person reporting it.",1
Public Services & Government,"My daughter had my cat in a pet box in her car and my cat busted out of the box and jumped on the dash board and was hissing, she was scaring my daughter.  She called Animal Control and they told her to listen to them.  Open her car door and let the cat run off, they weren't coming out to help my daughter.

My daughter explained she was in a busy intersection and they repeated, open the car door and let the cat run off.

That's my pet!!!  She would have been killed.  Seriously, what if my cat did run through traffic, it could have caused a terrible accident from people avoiding hitting a cat?  It would have killed my cat, I love her, the thought of her being in pain like that, makes me so upset, I still can't stop crying.

My daughter waited for me to get there, it took an hour, she left the cat in the car with the A/C running, it was 108 degrees outside, my daughter stood there on the hot pavement.

What is animal control there for anyway?  My daughter needed help!!",1
Public Services & Government,"I appreciate what animal control is there for...I really do. But when I witness them run around a neighborhood chasing a female boxer with a hurt left leg for over an HOUR as she huffs and puffs and has a FREAKING heart attack...I have come to realize these IDIOTS have no CLUE how to catch a dog. 
How about we try and calm her down, give her water, giver her some freaking food. Lions will run their pray till they almost die of exhaustion. It seems thats the only thing these overweight losers know what to do. 
Get in the car...chase the dog...get out of the car...chase the dog...get in the car...chase the poor dog. REALLY?

Public Services & Government,"A boy and his dog...inseparable.  Except when he leaves for the evening and someone else leaves the gate to the yard open.  This prompted a call to his mom at 12:30 am all the way over in California and social media blitzes internationally (I'm not kidding!).  ""Mom!  Starr is gone!""  We got that dog when he was a boy of 8 and he and that dog have been best friends for almost 17 years.  This was a catastrophic nightmare for all of us and for our extended family and friends as well who love her as their own.  

So what is a mother to do when she is this far away?  Well, first I called the microchip company (1-888-HOMEAGAIN) and ensured that our information was up-to-date.  Secondly, I purchased a package from them for a mere $17 that would send an email notification to all of the vets, Home Again subscribers, PetsMarts etc that may somehow see the animal.  That is one cool service!  

Thirdly, I called Animal Control.  Dispatch calmly listened to me frantically explain our situation and gave me the number and website information for the Lied Shelter, where all strays are taken.  (702-384-3333 and AnimalFoundation.com).  The number at night has a recorded message giving instructions and letting you know that the website is updated hourly with pet information. 

 I checked the website and used the user-friendly filtering system to sort the categories:  Dog, Female, Over 1 year old, Brown, Medium sized.  It came up with 12 dogs, none of which were our dearest Starr.  This went on through the night.  I kept checking, we were monitoring all the social media and the kids were combing the neighborhoods.  In the end, one of the kids went to Animal Control and found the intake paper clearly showing our beloved Starr.  She had managed, at 16 years old, to take a journey in a relatively short period of time 8 miles from home!  Thank goodness she was found! We are all really happy! 

Now, a few words of advice after this episode:

  Animalfoundation.com is useless until after the intake process. According to Lied (I left a message on their recorder and they did call me back today by around 1 pm) the animals are considered in-transit till then.  They are not scanned for microchips until the morning following their arrival at Lied.  Lied can hardly be blamed for this as they get 50 TO 60 ANIMALS PER DAY dropped off at the shelter.  Wow!! Per day including weekends!! So best bet is to just go to the shelter as soon as they are open to see if your dog is there. It would have been nice to have known that our pet would not be on the website for at least 24 hours after she went missing.  That is really my only complaint about the entire process. 

 I was very happy with the service from Animal Control.  Starr was picked up from a usually busy intersection unharmed and kept safe until my son arrived to pick her up.  They were particularly busy that night because the wind was up and many gates were being blown open, apparently.  

Thank you, Animal Control, for being a key part of bringing our beautiful pet back home to us!

Public Services & Government,"My first and only time riding Las Vegas' bus system was just a few days ago on New Year's Eve.  I wanted a cheap and safe way to get to the strip and this was my best option.  Despite living here on and off going on seven years now, this is my first adventure, so let's break it down.

The ride to:  Actually kinda fun.  I was able to hop on at a stop just a block or so away from my apartment.  The first leg took us to the South Strip transfer station where I got on a bus driven by a friendly young man ""staight outta detroit"" and a self-proclaimed ""gangsta"" but not in a creepy/scary way.  It was New Year's, the bus crowd was in a good mood and he made good use of the PA system, especially when we stopped at a red light next to a car that featured a couple having sex in the backseat.  Oh, Vegas.

The ride back: Not so great.  Had to walk a couple of miles just to reach a bus stop because of all the closures on the strip, which isn't the RTC's fault.  But once I got on a bus and reached the transfer station it was a bit of a fail.  We waited in the cold for a good 40 minutes for a bus to arrive.  People were worn out and just wanted to go home.  Would have been wise to have more buses on the ride during the busiest night of the year, but them's the breaks when you live in a city in financial dire straits.  Still, we all ended up getting home just fine.

I wouldn't want to ride RTC with any regularity, but it does the job in those special occasions when you need someone else to do the driving.",3
Public Services & Government,"Pros:
Well, at least we have a bus.

Cons:
Long waits inbetween buses/infrequent service.
Ridiculous fare prices that seem to go up every 2 months. 
HORRIFIC routing.
Gives priority to The Strip/tourists.(Well isn't that surprising?)
Assumes everyone who lives on the far north, west and south sides has a car.
The monorail failed, so now they're using bus riders as a scapegoat by raising the bus fare.

I hate Las Vegas public transportation. It's truly, utterly ridiculous. I don't think i'm ever going to get over how I have to take 3 buses to get to CSN on Charleston just because they refuse to place a bus on the major street nearest to where I live.",1
Public Services & Government,"For the regular RTC bus lines, I am not impressed.

 At least we have a bus, but useless in helping you out if you're not near on a main street going to a simple destination. When I first moved here, I used the RTC Tropicana line down to the strip. That was A-OK, easy enough and I'd give it a 3.5 star, until one day they had nearly started a riot. We had ridden the bus a few blocks down from my stop and told us the bus got hit last night and that they were taking it off service and another bus is on the way...maybe 10-15 minutes away. This was during peak morning hours where it was a jam packed extra length bus of people who worked in the casinos- we can't be fucking late! WTF? Why didn't they take the bus off last night when it got hit or taken it off service at the end stop of a route or why didn't they have the new bus go ahead of time and be waiting for us at that stop? IDIOTS in high places couldn't figure this simple solution out, but I sometimes feel they really don't give a damn about standards since what other alternative do bus riders have to the RTC? Yeah, many people were yelling, walked out and RAN to the strip, some walked to the Orleans to catch cabs, some like me stayed. I figured whatever I do, I'll be late and I was late. I had to run from the stop by Tropicana Hotel all the way to Planet Hollywood to make it 5 minutes before opening up shop in Miracle Mile. Pffft. It ruined my day having angry customers banging on the door while I'm trying to count out and open the register in a hurry and knowing I had one strike on my tardy record added. 

And when it comes to getting to other places around the city, forget it. I route a few spots that seemed simple enough to get to, it was like 2-4 bus transfers and a good 30 minute walk. It was pretty laughable to get 10 miles away it would take me that many bus stops and about 2-3 hours. It just means for things like that, people should have bicycles and they'll also get a nice exercise and be there in 30-60 minutes. 

Regular RTC gets a ONE star. 

Now why the 4 star after talking the smack about the CAT bus? 

Well, it's for the ACEXpress lines that restored my faith that they are trying to improve.

There is a ACEXpress C-Line that just opened up by my house in Centennial Hills. The transit starts at the Transit Station on N Durango and Elkhorn, goes on the 95FWY and stops at 4th St and Fremont in downtown, then goes to the Premium Outlets on Grand Central, then to the side of TI on Spring Mtn., Howard Hughes and Corporate Dr. and in front of UNLV. 

It wasn't a bad ride and whole lot easier for me to get down that ways to meet the BF at his work while I don't drive. Given, I'm probably not going to need it in a few months when I have a license, but I'm also thinking about my visiting friends and family. Don't have to pick their ass up- they can ride their on the bus up to my house now. HAHAHA 

One bit of sadness though- 

TWO WORDS: DESIGNATED DRIVER. 

If you live in Centennial Hills and planning to go to the clubs and get smashed, just riding this back home would be a good idea, but I think the last bus is 12am and doesn't start until 6-7am for work commutes. It was about 38 minutes from the transit center to TI and stops about every hour so would be convenient and just as fast as a car ride. It'll probably take a $60 cab to get up here when a C-Line one way ticket is $2 for locals and I think $3 for non. The short walk can be sobering or you can puke al fresco. RTC, tap into this. 

Otherwise, I'm happy there's a convenient bus for tourist friends who complain I live too far. No excuses now! Wooot! For that simple fact, they deserve the ""I'm a fan"" rating though I think it's just a A-OK service. 3.5 stars I suppose would be the most accurate (Yelp put a broader point system in!). rating of the new C-Line.",4
Public Services & Government,"Another gripe:

Why is it that most of the bus pass vendors are sketchy check loan centers such as Check City or Money Tree? And at the same time you guys take forever to supply the bookstore at CSN with more bus passes(as of today, they have been out of them for a week).
(P.S. I'm already aware that they finally decided to start vending them at Alberston's, which, you know, makes sense seeing that it is a grocery store, which is a place that people are more likely to go out of their way for than a fucking Check Cashing place. That's besides my point). 
Excuse me for not wanting to be forced to pay 3-5  bucks more for a piece of paper which you guys already charge too much for to begin with so I don't have to be forced to spend close to ONE HUNDRED dollars in one month on the bus rides I need to get back and forth to school every day. 

Just needed to let that out. It always feels slightly better to ride Las Vegas public transportation when you have an outlet to air out your frustrations about it. :)",1
Public Services & Government,"Important Tip: Don't mistake a RTC bus pass for the monorail pass.  It's a waste of $5.00 and you end up having to purchase another $5 monorail pass.  No, we weren't drunk when purchasing this but we weren't offerred a lot of guidance either by the automated kiosk.  [Original Visit: November 6, 2010]",2

MOAR Problems with the RTC:
Inconsistent Scheduling - For this semester of CSN I decided to pick earlier classes, so I figured that the schedules for all the buses in the morning would essentially be the same as the schedules in the late afternoon/evening. I was wrong. 
On my old schedule, when I was taking the Flamingo bus to Rainbow, the Northbound Rainbow bus would come within 5-10 minutes after the Flamingo bus arrived. On my new schedule, the Rainbow bus gets to Flamingo going Northbound 5 minutes BEFORE the Flamingo bus gets there. And that's just one issue. I decided to take a closer look at my bus schedule since I only pay attention to the times when I have to catch the bus and then promptly forget afterwards. It was then I realized that the schedules for the majority of the buses are random as all hell. I guess I was pretty naive for being annoyed that most of them only run every 30 minutes, I realized that their schedules greatly fluctuate between 20-40 minutes. It's ridiculous and makes absolutely no sense.
Detours - ENOUGH WITH THESE BLASTED DETOURS ALREADY. RTC, do you have any idea how annoying it is when I'm somewhere on Flamingo east of Rainbow, ready to go home and hop on the Flamingo bus only to see that it ends at Rainbow. WHY? Flamingo is a very major street littered with businesses and close to the homes of many, THAT DETOUR MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE. And yes, this isn't the only example. 

Also, there really need to be buses on Fort Apache, Hualapai, Durango and Buffalo, but that's just beating a dead horse. 

On a side note, at least a mild improvement has been made recently: No more upcharge for the buses that mainly serve The Strip and other tourist areas, and the new express buses, but none of that warrants another star from me. Sorry.",1
Public Services & Government,"http://rtcsnv.com/mpo/projects/flamingo/index.cfm

Okay, so the RTC has just proposed the Flamingo express which would be like the express buses we have for Strip/Downtown and Centennial Hills. Now this definitely sounded like an upgrade....until I got to this part:

""10-mile corridor that would extend from Rainbow Boulevard to Nellis Boulevard.""

ONLY to Rainbow? This express bus is incapable of serving anyone west of Rainbow?

I have no words.",1
Public Services & Government,"RTC's reply to my question:

""The project is defined as Rainbow to Nellis since that's where the roadway improvements will take place as far as a dedicated bus lane.  However, the route would extend to the ends as they do now on the existing Route 202.  Unfortunately the information provided on the website understandably leads people to believe an express route would only operate between Rainbow and Nellis.  If this is ever constructed, we have full intent of operating the route from the current Grand Canyon area to the Cannery and make use of the dedicated lanes between Rainbow and Nellis.
Thank you for your feedback.""

Okay, I'll take back what I said previously.",2
Public Services & Government,"Having used public transportation in cities across the country, I found the RTC buses to be on time, running often and clean, hbrid motored, and easy to use. Getting from Fremont street to the convention center was easy. Additionally, the people riding the bus were very sharing with seats and polite.  Ride the Bus save money and get there quickly! The all day pass is great!",5
Public Services & Government,"My very first trip to Vegas was dampened by the rude Bus Drivers! I work for a Transit System as well, so I am aware of the challenges of people and the road, but there is no excuse to be so rude. Caught the 104 , asked the Bus Driver if he was going past the Mall, told us No, kept saying to us ""Are you riding with me or not..Im late"" He wasn't late, had a 10 minute layover at the South Transit Centre. He only kinda helped after I informed him I am a union member and also drive City buses. Caught the SDX bus back, while it was at the Transit Centre, not moving, I looked in the Black Plexiglas window to check out the cockpit. A Female driver violently banged on the window, telling me I couldn't stand there and not hold onto the blue handle that is right in front of it. My friends also had similar experiences! I doubt very much that I will return to Vegas and spend my money there, the hotels make a ton of money, they need to get their own Hotel Shuttles going if they want to keep tourists coming back. Ive been treated better in 3rd world countries using their tiny buses!",1
Public Services & Government,Never ride this horrible thing there r psycho homeless people everywhere and the bus drivers are seriously extremely retarded I dont know how they still have a job and they steal your money if you make 1 little mistake I payed $5 to get 2 24 hour passes they are $2 each with a student id and the dumbass gives me 2 2 hour passes that isn't even worth $5 so I asked if I could have my dollar back and the retard couldn't understand me so I just got off this bus deserves 0 out of 5 it is just a waste of money to sit next to gross homeless freaks,1
Public Services & Government,"Horrible service outside the strip and too slow on the strip to be worthwhile.  An embarrassment to the las Vegas metro area. They only get two stars because the Deuce on the strip is not a bad way for tourists to ride a double decker bus up and down the strip (air conditioning, generally). However, even that's really slow -- but that's not RTC fault.

Everything else however is. They are a terribly dysfunctional agency who's service outside the strip is HORRENDOUS with buses routinely missing their scheduled time at least 2,3 times in a row. And this isn't due to traffic (as on the strip) its just because buses don't show up (I know because I often start at a terminus, and have waited an hour several times for a bus that is supposed to run every 15 minutes). 

I made the mistake of buying a 3 day bus pass in advance ($20, good deal or so it seems) for a 4 day trip. By the second day I knew I had made a horrible mistake, and there was no discussion but on the fourth day I used taxis. One of the taxi drivers (without me prompting) told me how everyone tells him the bus service is so bad and how its good for him. Personally I used to just rent a car but that's one of the few things that got a lot more expensive recently in Vegas. 

However, if you don't drink a lot I would just rent a car, otherwise, get a taxi. Don't get the bus, it will just ruin your vacation here. And for locals, it's even worse. These are people trying to get to jobs using the bus and they can only guess if they'll make it. RTC is by far the worst bus service in the country and the US has a lot of bad public bus companies. During my three days I noticed MANY fare inspectors on the buses; if RTC just instead invested in dispatchers and technology to make sure their buses run even close to schedule they would do a much better job. For a city with so many people so close by, RTC should have an easy job running buses profitably. But like the taxi driver told me, it's almost like a conspiracy to make the buses horrible so people will take the taxis/limos instead.",2
Public Services & Government,"RTC of Las Vegas is one of the most IGNORANT and insufficient Transportation Companies I've ever Encountered . This Company has some very Serious Issues internally ""Meaning Administrative "" and as well the Bus Service Itself. There is nothing good about this Public Transportation Service here in Las Vegas .SOME of the drivers are very rude and disconcerning about the passengers and are not helpful at all when a person that rides needs information and or directions about linking with another bus to get where they're going . The Worst experience that I've had  however is in regards to the Bus pass and or Transfer Transaction. this is the main reason for this Blog. I have been a PAYING CUSTOMER / rider and have exoerienced a Blank Transfer Dispensed out of the Fare Box  , in which the Bus Pass should Have Writing on the Back Indicating Time Of Purchase until Time Of Expiration.This has Been going on for Over 31/2 Years on My Behalf and each time I have filed a Complaint to RTC and it's Company.  I have at least Ten Complaints filed during this span of time to this Date . I've been into Disputes with RTC Driver about a PAID FARE and Also Attacked  by some of  the Passengers ,where they complained that ""I"" was holding up the bus because I wanted the driver to print out another transfer and or an alternative that RTC advised in case this happened again. The Bus Pass has a strip on back where you swipe the strip on the Bus Pass when you Board another Bus.RTC CLAIMS that if the Bus Pass prints out Totally Blank , that the black Swipe Stripe would still make the transfer Valid. On the Contrary I bought a Transfer /Buss Pass in the Past that came out completely Blank and the swipe strip did not beep in the fare box to confirm validity.My Comment about RTC BEING IGNORANT - comes from my Experiences with  Rtc Tansfers not being readable and or Valid .has happened to me Over and Over Again.,I've Approached The Business Offices In Writing about this Situation and RTC is still Dispensing Transfers Blank . RTC Says they have been notified to fix the fare boxes and have done so , Where the Fare Box runs out of ink !?!?  That is FALSEHOOD I have recently made moves to REMEDY this situation with  Pending Legal Procedures , this being the last resort on my behalf .

Where do I even begin? 

Take this standpoint from a local who has tolerated the frequent 30-minute delays for about 5 years now. All because I somehow convinced myself - for some reason - that my long background with commuter trains, buses, trams and minibuses back in Hong Kong would help me get by without a car. Reality is, you cannot get by without a car in Vegas. RTC did it for me today, I wave my white flag and am just waiting till exams are over so that my license will finally get into the picture. 

Today, I left the Sahara West Library 15 minutes before closing to give myself ample waiting time before SX-B would arrive. 2 hours later, not a single bus arrived. Don't take my words with a grain of salt. I'm not even exaggerating. As 8pm hit, I began to suspect that something was amiss. Were the employees on strike? Did the buses break down? RTC phone line only ran till 6pm so that was not an option. Friends/family who had cars were not available to pick me up. Before I knew it, a whole sunset had just taken place before my eyes and the sky was already dark. What on earth was this supposed to be, a layover of some sort? Even airport waiting times were never as long. Just tragic. 

Anyway, what I did next was brisk walk all the way from the Grand Canyon stop to Fort Apache, hoping to try my luck on the SX-A (which meets with the SX-B at Fort Apache).There were people - good sign of safety - and lights. Almost 3 hours into my wait, guess which bus arrived - SX-B - the one I had waited for all afternoon! And the driver did not even knew what went on. I was outraged. To think how much time it would've taken to get home - 5 neighborhood blocks away - which would've been 10 minutes by car! I had 2 books checked out from the library, both of which I finished reading by the time the bus arrived. 

RTC gravely needs to improve their payment system as well, by establishing a tap card-ish service (we called them octopus cards in HK, clipper at the Bay). Buses run late sometimes because people take long paying $2/$5 in pennies and many times, the swipe-in day passes don't work once they are crumpled up a bit. There have been numerous instances where fights broke out and the drivers didn't mind having it going. 

Recently, RTC has tried to up its services by installing wi-fi within the bus. Perhaps it would be more useful to have that installed at the stops instead considering the delays and waiting. I understand that public transportation is not a big thing in this city but why don't we stop to think that maybe the reason people are so resistant to give up driving is because they have heard discouraging stories - turning the situation into a vicious cycle. Ever since I started college, I sought refuge in RTC to get me to school on time. However, after that one winter morning when the bus never arrived for me to catch a chemistry quiz (thankfully a friend swooped me to school just in time), I leave the house 2 hours before my first class just to make sure I am punctual. 

For the sake of the people of Las Vegas, I hope RTC will be able to tackle the issues that have been surrounding the agency for awhile now and improve their efficiency. 

Sorry guys, 2 stars.",2
Public Services & Government,"I am writing this review as I'm I am trying to calm myself. I needed to take the bus from the Monte Carlo to Town Square. I get to the MC stop and there is no machine to buy a ticket. So I figured I could pay with my card on the bus itself. WRONG! I get on and ask to pay in card and the woman rudely told me, Cash Only. Well all I had was a $20 bill for a ticket that only costs $5. I asked if it would give change and she said, No Change. So I paid $15 EXTRA for a ticket because YOU, the RTC do not have a ticket machine at each bus stop! 

So we get to Mandalay Bay and the woman says, Last Stop. So she continues on and I walk down to the second level and say, ""doesn't this go to Town Square?"" She says no and I inform her that the maps for the Deuce at Monte Carlo said there is a stop at Town Square. 

I am extremely dissatisfied with my very first experience with the RTC and will certainly never use it or recommend it to anyone ever again.",1
Public Services & Government,Its a shame that most of the drivers are so rude u can say hello r hi and get no response what so ever was on 109 yesterday and the driver a female was just plain rude and nasty like she hated her job and everyone in it no customer skills here,1
Public Services & Government,"This bus system is unlike anything that I have ever seen. Not even Miami-Dade buses are this wretched and they have sky high crime. Riding on board feels like the Twilight Zone meets musical chairs in broad daylight. Some bus routes are mobile war zones (e.g. 206 and 105) while others offer a more diverse assortment of M&M's (e.g. would-be murderers, dirty vagrants, substance abusers, people engaging in trash and flash and etc.) for one's riding pleasure. Not even riding the 6 train to the Bronx nor taking the PATH at night was ever this bonkers. Oh yes, here's looking at you, Vegas.    

I am not even going to fully detail RTC's lack of punctuality and disdain for paying passengers such as not informing people of detours. The bus drivers and administrative staff could care less; they are in their air conditioned offices looking important from their cubicles. Las Vegas (including RTC) makes the fallacy to presume that all people who ride the bus are poor trash. That mentality only attracts the same people they deride. Maybe the concept that some bus passengers ride to be green, have the passenger view and chill is too abstract for them to comprehend at this time. 

The markup prices that RTC charges tourists are so not worth the sh.. service that is rendered. If you do decided to board the bus for some odd reason (driving here's dangerous, I know), always purchase your bus passes at an RTC bus terminal. This way, you can obtain the locals price. If you're gonna blow $20 on the Deuce for a few days, why not spend $35 on a residential two week bus pass? When you leave Vegas, you can always pay it forward and give the bus pass to a needy person. There is a lot of poverty in this shiny entertainment mecca. 

My advice for tourists who actually decide to visit Sin City: drive and stay away from most residential neighborhoods. In the span of a decade (maybe longer, if I am right), this town has transformed into an open air zoo. You never know what kind of animals you will encounter be it gorillas, chimpanzees, feral hogs, bison and snakes (constrictors and venomous). 

Think of being on the Strip like having a chaperoned date that tells you, ""If you have sex, you die and go to hell."" The sad truth in this parable is that your conservative chaperone is right and actually means well. Stay in the better part of the Strip indoors or only venture outside to specific locales (e.g. Red Rock, Las Vegas Springs Preserve and Valley of Fire) and you'll tend to be okay if you check your lunar calendar. However, I can't issue any guarantees for anyone's safety in Las Vegas. I hate to sound superstitious, but observe the cycles of the moon and the people, and see what you come up with.  

Riding the cab is at your own risk. This isn't NYC where you can flag a cab and set a negotiable price. From the moment that you hop on in, your life's being billed away. That, and cabbies get into a lot of accidents here over unsafe driving and the results for the parties involved are often fatal.",1
Public Services & Government,"$6 bucks for a one way three stop ride... Wow.

Anyways. Driver was nice and very informative. Was a nice ride.

I think I waited for the bus longer then my ride was to south terminal. 

For $6 you get a two hour base fare. So it works, but still a bit high when LA is $1.75 per ride.

$8 gets you a better deal. So if you plan on using them get the $8 ticket.",3
Public Services & Government,"The worst form of public transportation this country has to offer. You're better off walking. Even if it takes you an hour and a half, you will get there before the bus. Its one thing for a scheDuled bus to be late but to just not show up at al!?! What the F@CK?!?! THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME TOO MANY TIMES TO COUNT!!!! Last time I checked I was paying, not getting on the bus for free. The standard needs to be raised immediately!",1
Public Services & Government,"Terrible. I gave only one star.  While SDX and Deuce are convenient and little cheaper than cab to move down the Strip to/from downtown, it has issues with inefficient and mediocre service. I was taking it only 2 days and I already ran into buses that were unreliable. 

For example I was trying to take northbound SDX at Casino Center/Carson south of Carson street after 5:45 pm,  the one which takes the detour and doesn't stop at the station by parking garage due to light shows. When I see bus coming, it doesn't stop and instead stops at the original non-evening location. I run there, see all people offloading, I am trying to board the bus and get refused. For some reason they made it last stop and did not take people I think. The RTC that did not let me wasn't professional, when I asked isn't this bus that goes to LV Premium North, he says it was, and the door closes. WTF?

The cheapest fare is $6 for only 2 hours or $8 for 24 hours. This is the most expensive US public transportation system I have ever seen in the US compared to San Francisco, LA, Chicago or New York. 

Also good luck trying to catch bus to the airport on the strip. There is no one stop convenient transfer station and the map guides they give you lack important detals, maps with route stops are misleading and look like share some  stop for couple routes, but they are actually two different stops that may be a 1 or 2 blocks away. The only convenient station transfers are outside the strip at SST, BTC and downtown (where I saw WEX and SDX share same stop, why they can't make one in front of any single casino on The Strip?).",1
Public Services & Government,"I utilized Yelp talk to find an alternative to expensive airport parking and this RTC Park and Ride was suggested.  

I am unfamiliar with public transportation so the night before my flight I did a practice run because I didn't want any morning of stress.  I went into the facility to verify cost,  route, where the bus picks up, and how long my car could be parked there without a problem.  The clerk at the information desk was very helpful.  

Thursday morning I arrived at about 6:45 and was on the bus by 7:00.  $2 to the airport, and I think we made one or two stops on the way and arrived at the airport within 20 minutes. The return that Sunday was just easy.  

So $4 to park my car for four days, I call that a bargain.  Add to that not having to inconvenience any friends or coworkers.  Also, there is no time limit on how long your car is there.  A posted sign said if you plan to leave it more than 7 days just let security know.",5
Public Services & Government,"The worse form of public transportation.  I have yet to find one route on time.  Never seen a supervisor.  The drivers don't care.  It seems like the times are ""suggestions"" half the time the bus doesn't even show up at all.",1
Public Services & Government,"The Deuce! 
This double decker bus takes you from the Strip to the Downtown area, and all points in between. The bus is air conditioned, and has free Wifi. The bus here is a lot more expensive than the other public transits I've taken in other cities. Even NYC isn't this expensive for the bus. But they offer a 24 hour ticket that pays for itself at three rides. The 24 hrs is a running clock, not calendar, so that's helpful. 
The buses run 24 hours a day, and there's stops everywhere. 
The problem with this bus is that it takes forever to get anywhere. It was about a 45 min drive to get downtown. They stop at every podunk stop along the way. It'd be nice if they had an express option. 
There aren't any bathrooms on the bus. Don't drop a deuce.",4
Public Services & Government,Some of the worse bus drivers. Not sure why in a customer service/experience area people suck at providing even sub par customer service. I always learned if you don't like your job quit OR suck it up and do what needs to be done. There are very few drivers that actually act like they care but for the driver on the 119 at 2:45 you sir need to go reassess and learn to be more personable and stop at stops that are scheduled and not skip stops cause you dont wanna stop,1
Public Services & Government,"Absolutely Abysmal.

I take the bus to work (the strip) every morning. The first bus is usually always on time. It's been late maybe one or two times since I started using the bus 2 months ago.

The praise ends there.

The 119 (Simmons) is ALWAYS late. It has never been on time. It typically runs between 8-12 minutes late. Mind you, my stop is maybe the 6th or 7th stop on its route. The bus driver has a piss poor attitude and always looks like he just crapped his pants. He is rude and clearly doesn't give a shit about his job. I've seen people greet him and he'll just snub them completely. We're supposed to feel safe with someone like that?

The other passengers are trash. Maybe 20% are decent people but the rest of them make you lose hope in humanity. Gang bangers, junkies, prostitutes, uneducated beings... you name it, you'll find it.

Some of the people are LOUD. Screaming on the phone, Yelling their conversations (when literally two feet away from each other) Of course, the bus drivers do NOTHING!!!


*note; As I'm writing this a loud mouth uneducated banshee is screaming in my ear (talking to someone else) butchering the english language, eating food and spilling it everywhere...

So much for rules... I'm appalled.

The bus is disgusting. On top of overpaying for a less than stellar service you have to deal with this garbage. What a joke. The bus sucks. The drivers (90%) suck. The passengers will make you hate humanity and you will get sick and tired of it very quickly. 

If I could give 0 stars, I would...",1
Public Services & Government,This review is coming from non-local who visits Vegas occasionally. The last year or so I've taken the bus to either get to the local shopping mall here or downtown Las Vegas. Sure it's loud and sure it can be late at times but I'd rather let the bus driver worry about driving in night traffic than myself. It's better for my health. Walking the whole strip was cool and good exercise but I'm glad I can take a bus to do that now.,3
Public Services & Government,"These tourist make me laugh with these good reviews. Your here for a week and took the bus twice!! I've been riding this shit bus daily for over 5 years and let me assure everyone The Las Vegas RTC SUCKS.  The busses are always late if the show up at all. The drivers are absolute ASSWHOLES.  Fortunately for these tourist with the nice reviews didn't have to ask the driver for directions, or it would be a different review. ...",1
Public Services & Government,"I have used RTC since I moved here 2012 and I have told myself in the pass that standing close to the RTC bus is a death sentence. Today, 03/16/2016 at 12:50pm at Swenson x Desert Inn, RTC (small white 8-10 passenger bus) sentenced a pom-papillon mixed dog to its death. RTC bus driver didn't even slow down when the 6 lanes already stop and they stopped in the middle of the intersection for the dog but the bus didn't bother to slow down. RTC need to drive base on the condition of the road. RTC is a killers, worst than truck drivers. 

Visitors need to be very careful standing close to RTC bus. The don't care for anyone because they think they have the authoritive power to do whatever they like. If you look at truck driver and RTC driver you will see the cruel driving method of RTC. They will leave passenger behind once they think they couldn't stop so they can save their brakes and time.",1
Public Services & Government,"Cons:
 
 Long wait time outside to pass through security. Being Las Vegas, waiting outside in the summer is not an enjoyable experience.
  Parking at the on-site parking lot is $$$. Even for downtown parking.
  Once inside no cell phone use. If you don't have reading material, it is boring.

Positives:
  
 On my two visits here, the IRS agents have been friendly and helpful. 

  Modern building. Although waiting is boring, the interior is not dismal.  So the depressing factor is nonexistent.

Recommendations:

   Park at a downtown casino, and walk vigitantly alongside the north sidewalk  along Ogden Street that passes under the railroad tunnel. With the money you save on parking, you can treat yourself to a good meal afterwards. I recommend the Main Street Buffet.
  
  Try to get there by opening time, to avoid a long line outside.

  Bring a good book or magazine. Cell phone use is prohibited.

  Be careful filing your taxes, so that you do not end up here.",3
Public Services & Government,"Very pleasant, moved quick, only waited 1hr when lobby was full. Parking sucks though.",4
Public Services & Government,"Very unfriendly staff at the front, very un-knowledgable about everything!! Don't let these  people ruin your day, It's bad in here disputing some
Bs charge !!!!",1
Public Services & Government,"Ohh boy... Ok well first of all I suggest getting here early and treat it like the DMV. They open at 8:30am M - F and according to the employee I talked to inside they always have a line. If you don't get here first thing in the morning and need to meet with one of their tax people plan on being here for at least a couple hours. 

Also, Parking is $3 per 1/2 hour! There is no other close resource for a parking spot, but I bit the bullet anyway and used a meter downtown just a block off Freemont street. You'll need $2 in change for 2 hours and that was the max the meter I used would go to. But it beat the almost $20 parking in the building would cost me. So long as I make it back to my car within 2 hours and don't get a parking ticket. It was still a couple block walk back to the building but I needed the exercise anyway. 

When you get here get inline to get a ticket. They give out tickets with numbers corresponding to your problem, then take a seat and wait. Also although they do not close until 4:30 pm, they are known to stop giving out tickets as early as 1:30 pm, which means you will have to come back another day. 

So to sum up, Get here early like 8 am, park a few blocks away and save some money on your parking and don't fall behind on your Taxes!!!",3
Public Services & Government,so I went at 7:30 on Monday ..parked in the casino garage and validated .. means I had 3 hours free parking .. walked thru the underpass and got in line .. only 9 people in front of me ..

Public Services & Government,"I arrive on two different occasions with more than an hour and a half before it closes, with them not issuing anymore tickets and 8people sitting in the lobby. In efficient!! And I have to pay for parking. Every other agency has validation. Ridiculous!",1
Public Services & Government,"Holy crap, be prepared to wait and wait and wait.  When I go there in the morning had to stand in a line outside the building in 105 degree heat for an hour just to get through security and into the IRS office.  Once inside the office you have to get into another line to state what reason you are there for and get a number.  Then after that I sat around for another 4 hours waiting for said number to be called.  On the plus side everyone that I encountered was very friendly and professional.",2
Public Services & Government,The line thru security was bearable for a Friday morning even though I arrived after opening. I waited two hours for my number to be called. Mrs. Lena was outstanding she solved my tax problem with the quickness within minutes I was on my way home,5

Are all the citizens here like sheep that they forget it's us who pays the salaries and bills for this agency created,approved and signed into legislation by President Taft. The charge for parking is not only outrageous it's criminal. I consider myself a taxpayer not a tax protester. But you can no longer call the IRS 800 number and get any tax question answered by an IRS person. So If you are a US citizens filing taxes requiring IRS assistance in Las Vegas you have no choice but to go downtown to its office. Our government which has and continues to give our tax money to foreign countries and our enemies who have killed and continue to kill Americans and are constantly trying to destroy our way of life shows utter contempt and unconcern for us taxpayers by making us pay more because of their own complicated and uninterpreted tax code. Certainly our fine Senators and elected representatives to Congress could find some of the billions of dollars given to actions against us and allow for us to have free parking or build a parking garage to allow same while we seek assistance to provide us answers to our current tax questions. I still cant believe just why we stand quietly by for this injustice while our government continually wastes our tax dollars. This is just another stab in our backs and kick in our butts.

They also didn't serve soup on this day which was sad since it was cold and raining outside.  A few of the dressings were very good though.  The place is small, clean, and empty.

Prices are average for a sandwich shop.",3
Restaurants,"While the place has an original menu, everything they serve ends up tasting the same in my opinion.  Perhaps it is because they offer only 2 bread choices, or in their way of cooking, but I just was not impressed by their sandwiches.  
I had their standard fries as well, and they used a seasoning that was not very complimentary to the sauces they served on the side.  I did enjoy the kettle chips that were included with the sandwich, but for nearly $10 a pop, I expect a bit more from a sandwich.",2

Arts & Entertainment,"Suck it ticketmaster. 

Not only do you have a monopoly on concert tickets, but you charge ridiculous prices, don't give enough to the artists, and then you add in all these silly 'convenience' fees and 'handling' charges that push ticket prices up 50% from the advertised price. A pair of $25 tickets can easily run upwards of $100 dollars when all is said and done. Thats just wrong.

The other day i heard on the radio that a local station was doing a deal where that day only you could get tickets to see one of my GF's favorite bands for $10 a piece. So as soon as i get to the office, i jump online and start to buy tickets, after all your silly fees and charges they were $25 bucks a piece, that's more than double the advertised price. 

Did i mention that i hate you?",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I'd give Ticketmaster negative stars if it were possible.  They charge ridiculous fees, they only send your tickets to your billing address (I'm on vacation here) in about 2 weeks and you can't get the tickets anywhere except ticketmaster.  I wonder if the venues care about how much business they are losing because of ticketmaster? 

Plus the website doesn't work very well, not displaying parts of the pages necessary to actually buy a ticket, or it can't find the event.

I'll just skip the shows or try to buy from the stand-by list.  

Ticketmaster sucks.  I'll never attempt to use them again, I'll never go to a show that requires me to buy through them and I'll write to all the shows I can find to let them know how bad ticketmaster is.",1

Arts & Entertainment,"Please do not use Ticketmaster if you are looking to be treated fairly.  It won't happen.  I purchased 4 tickets to a PAC 12 basketball tournament via website at my hotel room.

When it wouldn't allow me because the timeframe of the event, I tried to post them for sale on the same website.  It wouldn't allow me to post the tickets for sale.  Of course, I had to wait until the next day because there was no ticketmaster office open, which is the day of the event.  I am now stuck with 4 tickets ($193.00) to a game today that I cannot use.  If I had purchased them at the box office and was still standing there, I could have returned them, but because I purchased through Ticketmaster the tickets are non-refundable regardless.  I will never purchase anything from Ticketmaster in the future.",1
Arts & Entertainment,Buy tickets directly from the vendor. Do not use ticketmaster. They do not care about people. They do not do what they say. They only want your money.

I will certainly never do business with them again even if it means missing a show I want to see.",1
Arts & Entertainment,Very disappointed with ticketmaster not acknowledging a glitch in their system. Spoke with three different individuals regarding my recent purchase to see Donny and Marie at the Flamingo Hotel. I have proof that my initial purchase should have included a meet and greet. All they kept repeating is our system shows you purchased a standard ticket. Obviously that's what their system shows! That's the whole problem! They didn't want to see the proof I had. They had an opportunity to make it right by providing a meet and greet for the next show. But unfortunately their system doesn't allow for them to check that option. #ridiculous #poorcustomerservice,1
Restaurants,"So the entire point of fast food is supposed to be that it is quick and easy right? Not so much the case at this particular chain location. I have been here twice now. The first time was just for the drive through and all I order was a shake. After placing my order I waited in line for the cars in front of me to get their food for more than 10 minutes. While the cashier apologized for my wait, I then personally waited at the drive thru window for over 5 minutes while he made my one shake. Not really sure what that was all about. More recently I went inside and was the only person in the restaurant. It took more than 5 minutes to get my food too, and the employees spent a lot of time joking around with each other while I stood there just waiting and watching.

The inside is precious, decorated to the T-- not a single spot was missed.  Our food was placed on a silver tray and handed over to us to sit in a comfy booth and enjoy our wraps and pizza.  It was really good.  The place is just so darn adorable; it's hard to concentrate on the food when everything was so POSH while you NOSH.  Get it?",5
Restaurants,"-------------update: as of January, 08, I heard this place has closed ------

Posh Nosh - neither posh nor... nosh?

Actually, this place is OK. Although I wonder how it would do if it weren't for the fact that it's in downtown Mesa, so there is NO competition. At all. Unless you count the Taco Bell, the Subway or the Quiznos. Or that weird gas-station looking Mexican place...

Posh Nosh's pasties and pizzas are tasty, but overpriced. Their coffee is so-so. Their salads are waayyy too tiny for the price. However, things might be looking up -- the last time I was there I had the caprese salad, and it was really good.

The desserts look really nice, but I've never had them. So, I guess, when push comes to shove, I have mixed feelings about Posh Nosh.

Edited to let ya'll know: I had their gelato last week. Pistachio. AMAZING! Best gelato I've had.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"This show didn't do it for me.  I had higher expectations because it is the only ice show of its kind at the moment on the Strip, but it was quite a disappointment for me.  First of all, the room is set up for so that as a couple, you are sitting across a 2 ft wide table from each other (facing each other) and you have to turn your head to see the stage.  Let me just say that after 15 minutes, my neck and subsequently my side was aching (although I was 6.5 months pregnant).

The stage is surprisingly small which forces the skaters to go in small circles to do their tricks. The humor was painful to watch.  I don't doubt everyone was very talented but I had trouble with the very glitzy sparkly outfits and countless hair tosses.  It was cheesy to me, bottom line.  And I felt the performers had an air of ""too-cool-for-school"" as opposed to being there to engage and WOW the audience.  For some reason, I felt the performers were trying too hard to get attention, instead of letting their talents shine on their own.  

A few of the balancing tricks were amazing, I was somewhat entertained overall, but was very very glad I did not have to pay for tickets (thanks to attending a grueling 2.5 hr timeshare pep rally).

I have been spoiled by artistic details and original musical presentation of the Cirque Du Soleil.  ICE does not compare in the least.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"This show was wonderful. It was great to see both my 12 year old son and 5 year old daughter equally enjoy a performance.  The performers were daring, funny, graceful, beautiful.  Took three generations to see this show and all came away awestruck by the feats of skill.  Spring for the better seats - ice chips come flying at you as the performers zip around the stage.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"On May 21st, ICE celebrated it's 1-year-anniversary.  The way they celebrated this was by offering locals tickets for $1.10 ($6.60 after taxes).  Since the tickets are regularly $70, this was an excellent deal and a great opportunity to experience an ice/acrobatic show.  I'd seen the signs for this as well as the actors running up and down the Strip promoting the show, so my interest was peaked.

Now, having seen the show, my observation is mixed.  I really did enjoy the show, I found the theme entertaining and the acrobatics engaging, but this is nothing I haven't necessarily seen before.  Many of the acrobatics could be found in one of the small circus tent acts that come to your neighborhood from time to time (usually in a shopping center parking lot).  From balancing to leaps, many of the tricks in ICE are circus acts w/ ice skates.  Much like watching Terry Fator do impressions without moving his mouth (doing ventriloquism), it's great to watch and can be amazing for a moment or two, but you do get the feeling you've seen this before.

Another issue is the seating.  It's a small theater, relatively, for what you are watching.  The people are crammed into the theater in a most lazy fashion with booths and tables setup like what you may find in a lounge.  The area inside the ice which can only be accessed by a bridge looked much more comfortable, though part of the action goes around this area so you may miss something.

I wouldn't recommend bringing kids to this show.  It's a little too sensual in places and overall is not as flashy or exciting as La Reve (the only Cirque style show I've seen otherwise).  Cirque, ICE is not.  I stand by my statement that this is truly a circus on ICE.  Like another reviewer stated, if the Cirque people did take this act and make it ""Cirque"" then it may have a better overall appeal.

Lastly, the Riviera is an interesting choice for the location.  It's not dead center on the strip such as the Mirage or MGM where you find the true Cirque shows.  Moving down into this area, finding casinos like the Sahara or Stratosphere will also find you struggling acts in their respective theaters.  All of these casinos are too far away from the main part of the strip to attract that compulsive crowd that will walk in the day of the show.  Wohscigam, Matsuri, Gameshow Spectacular, Amazing Johnathan and others have all suffered from this north strip locality. 

The ICE crew does do a good job of advertising themselves on the south part of the strip, however, so they are making up for this lack of exposure.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I finally got a chance to see this show yesterday.
As many reviewers state before this is not an ice/skating show (even though a couple guys skate pretty good and do some tricks). It is mostly acrobatics performed on ice rink. 
So since I'm not the greatest show critic I'll just tell few things (but still take my opinion with a grain of salt)

- few parts were too stretched out and I was almost about to nap on my friend's shoulder :)
- not really a con but theater is rather small so choose seats closer to the center.
- guys really need to smile more during show
- clowns were somewhat boring
+ girls are great looking!",3
Arts & Entertainment,"My favorite show! I love this show! 
it starts off with the whole crew out skating while some do balancing acts. But it progressives well with different performers doing different specialites. 
The music is interesting. Who knew abunch of Russians could get down to James Brown? That is the best part of the show, and each time i see it I'm still amazed.
Also for an extra 20 you can meet the cast now. I did. I took pictures of everything and took pictures with so many of the cast. And yes they are all from Russia. 
ICE is taken from the Russian Ice Circus of Moscow. Which is an ice Cirqu Du Soliel type of show. 
The theatre is old. Yes it's the riveria. But screw that. the show is amazing. 
:) ANd if you need someone to go with you! I'm down!
Oh and you can bring in drinks and food. Just not glass. So i go across the street and grab 1$ margaritas and enjoy the show.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I was quite impressed with this show, another lesson learned that you shouldn't always pre-judge the quality of a show in Las Vegas by the casino it's playing in.  ""Ice"" plays at the Riviera, which is one of the lower-end casinos on the Strip.  But despite it's location, this show was definitely worth the time.

As the name suggests, ""Ice"" is based on figure skating.  But that's not the extent of it, there are many facets to this production.  There's about 8-9 individual scenes ranging from comedy to acrobatics to good-ol' artistic figure skating.  And each one ranges from entertaining to breathtaking.  The show starts off with some figure skaters doing balancing acts on top of poles, moves on to a beautiful artistic pairs routine, then on to some acrobatics and juggling, some more pairs skating, a woman who does a hoola-hoop routine on skates (possibly the highlight of show), some unicycling on skates, some ice dancing to funk and disco music, and some see-saw jumping (with the climax being a skater being catapulted backwards onto a chair 25 or so feet in the air).  In between, there are elements of comedy performed by the three guys who I gathered are the main characters of the show (admittedly, the comedy routines weren't always hilarous and sometimes went too long, but there were probably 30 kids in the audience and they laughed continuously during these portions, so they're doing something right).  

If there's one thing I've learned to respect about Russian performers from watching shows like this one and the Greg Popovich show at Planet Hollywood, it's their ability to be world-class in more than one discipline.  For example, the three guys that were the main characters, in additional to being exceptional figure skaters, were also top-notch performers in another discipline.  One was an excellent juggler, he would have impressed me with his juggling skills if he was on feet, let alone doing it while skating backwards.  Another was an amazing fiddle player, and the third had his own individual routine where he rolled around and did tricks in a large metal ""wonder wheel"" type apparatus.  This is one of the things that make this show so amazing- it's hard enough to become a world-class performer in one discipline let alone also become a world-class figure skater to boot!

All-in-all, I would definitely recommend this show.  It might lack the ""holy crap"" moments that the Cirque de Soleil shows have, but they're also doing their stuff on figure skates instead of their feet, so that's to be expected.  Ignore the fact that it's at the Riviera, I have a feeling it will be somewhere better in the future.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"There were a couple of applause-worthy moments, but otherwise, in a word...BLECH. 

We ordered VIP seats which are pretty nice in that they're right up in front of the ice, but as soon as we sat down, we detected the very strong stench of mold. So that was our initiation. The venue itself is old, old school vegas lounge which has huge kitsch value. 

The show itself just felt very foreign from beginning to end, foreign in that the humor, choreography and dancers' personalities just seemed so bizarre. I feel like this must have been choreographed by some old Russian guy about 3 decades ago. For example, a woman started doing a bunch of hula hoops. At one point, she had about 10 going at the same time from knee to neck, which was pretty cool. But then someone came out and dumped about 30 hula hoops on her. After a huge heave-ho, she hoists them all up to simultaneously swing them around about 2 full rotations. Then she dropped them, looking to the audience for applause, as if that was supposed to impress us. I wanted to jump up and say to her: ""sometimes, less is more honey.""

The acrobatic scenes had these painfully long pauses before one person would jump on a seesaw to have the other fly up in the air. They kept doing basically the same move over and over again with a 10-second pause before the little flip. 30 years ago this may have captivated audiences, but in today's hyperspeed media world, it doesn't cut it.

The curtain call was also strange. After each soloist came out and took their little individual bows, the curtain went down suddenly and all the lights went out. Everybody was desperate to leave, but after some awkward moments in the dark, the curtain and lights come back up 30 seconds later and they all skate up slowly to take a bow. Strange given that they'd already pretty much taken their bow. 

The humor sections were just painful, not funny at all, and the actors doing the humor were so cheesy. The skaters were for the most part joyless, not enjoying their time there and clearly watching the clock. They could have upped the kitsch factor by making this a topless show, but let's face it, that would just make this show a different kind of tragic.

The best thing about this show is that it is only an hour long. We pretty much sprinted out as soon as it ended.

We got these tix for half price, but still overpaid. I would value this show at around $15/person. Can I suggest you pay the premium to go see one of the Cirque shows?",1
Arts & Entertainment,"The Ice Show has very talented and hard working performers. I think the smaller stage did prohibit them a little but all in all I think the show is great! And I dont understand why people call the Riviera horrible. The Riviera is not as extravagant as the others on the strip but it is still a nice place. As for the theater, it is older but it has a history and there is nothing wrong with that. And as for the price of the show, that is up to the show producers not the Riviera. If you have a chance come see the show!!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Although this show isn't heavily advertised, it was a pretty good show!  I managed to get free tickets to this one from a friend who worked in it and I went to see it with my mom.  My friend got us some great seats right next to where all the skaters go by.  The acrobatics and the ice-skating were actually very impressive considering the size of the show.  The costumes were also great, and it's easily a kid-appropriate show.  It also had funny moments too.  I'm lucky I got tickets!",3
Restaurants,"I have been to the Red Room multiple times for both dinner as well as just lounging late at night as a bar/hang out.  

What really draws me to this establishment is the fact that in Pittsburgh, which hasn't really yet joined the rest of America's larger cities in becoming smoke free, this is a gem of place - smoke free!!!!  

It's interesting to note that the place is very hit or miss in terms of the number of people that come out to play at this restaurant/bar/lounge.  In the immortal words of my sister's boyfriend, ""sometimes this place is poppin' bee-yotch!  and sometimes it's not!""  :D

First, this ambiance/decor is very cool.  In one area, there are lots of comfy couches for people to relax and socialize.  Of course, there is the bar itself, and then there is the restaurant area.  So, whatever you happen to be in the mood for, you can get.  

The restaurant has an excellent menu, but it is a bit pricey.  This is definitely a place that you have to go to knowing you will be spending some $$$.  In terms of the appetizers, I highly recommend the Seared beef tenderloin and toasted brioche with blue cheese port fondue ($13) - this is always a perennial fave with everyone who has tried it.  I have tried a number of their entrees and specials and really haven't had a bad one yet.  But the entrees will run you $20-40.  And save room for dessert - the bread pudding is so great.  Anyone who knows this place knows that it used to be even better (if you can believe it) but even in its new form, still a dessert to plan on getting.

Drinks - they always have a nice by the glass wine selection.  And the wine bottles aren't too expensive, depending on what you choose.  The martinis are great - try the South Beach.  It will seriously knock you out after 1 or 5.  :D  And I don't say that from experience.  ;)  The expresso martini is also a good choice - if you want to stay up all night.

Overall, I love this place.  Try it if you get a chance!  And remember, if the first time isn't quite what you were expecting, give it another try.",4
Restaurants,"I can't really speak for the food. I've been to Red Room countless times for drinks. The Tomolive martinis, dirty, with gin, is pretty much all I order here. Ambiance is nice and the wait staff is excellent. I only wish it were open later. The only bad thing I can say is that the martini's are pricier than many similar lounge/bars in Pittsburgh.",4
Restaurants,"Great atmosphere in an up-and-coming neighborhood.  Red Room has an eclectic menu that changes frequently, and puts unique spins on American cuisine.  

When you walk in, the walls are of course a dark shade of red and the whole restaurant is mostly candle-lit.  On the left is lounge area with extremely comfortable leather chairs all along the wall, as well as a fireplace which makes for a great place to drink with friends.  We talked to a man who we think was the owner, who told us that he bought and shipped all the leather chairs from a specialty shop in North Carolina. This lounge would be great if you're bringing in friends from out of town. On the right side of the restaurant is the dinner area, which is private and would make a very nice date place. Just make sure you make reservations, especially if you're going on a weekend.  

First of all, you wouldn't think that a restaurant could do bread / butter really well.  But they gave us warm breakd with pomegranate butter.  We went through two baskets; I'm not kidding. 

Next, we had some mohitos, which were great for the first round.  The second round tasted a little bitter, but were still good.  

We started our with the arugula pirogi with the truffle sauce, sized enough for a taste and were very unique. For the entree, my wife had one of the specials, a heavier seafood pasta with a bold taste. I had the Gulf shrimp tempura with sticky rice, which was delicious. The dish came with ~6 fried tempura shrimp pieces on skewers, served on sticky rice with a spicy dipping sauce.  It was excellent. After all that, we had no room for dessert. 

The only reason I give this place a 4 out of 5 is that the service was somewhat slow, but the waitress was very nice and explained to us several times that they were running a bit behind. Both drinks and food took a while to come to the table. 

The only other issue would be parking. We didn't see any kind of valet service, but they might have it at other times (we went on a weeknight). We parked at the Walgreens parking lot and walked across Center Ave.  You could park across Center Ave on Highland Ave closer to the restaurant, but it can be tough to find parking. 

Overall, a great place to have in Pittsburgh. With faster service, this place would be a 5 out of 5.",4
Restaurants,"I had dinner here and the food was fresh and deliciously complicated.  It felt like I was eating food from the Top Chef.  Thankfully, our waiter Jim, who had worked with the chef Kevin Sousa at 3 previous restaurants, was able to explain to us every dish so that we could understand the party that was happening in our mouths.  

The chef used a lot of different ingredients in every dish, but the flavors went perfectly with each other and you could taste the each individual flavor despite how complicated the dishes were.

To start we had:
- Shrimp sausage with pureed shrimp fried rice, a korean bbq sauce, kim chi cole slaw and peas
- Massaman curry soup with a generous pinch of crab meat
- Cooked tomato butter with the bread

To eat we had:
 - Pork belly with crawfish, beans of a possibly refried nature, condensed snow peas infused with grapefruit, mushrooms and pistachio crumble 
- Pike wrapped in chicken skin, with rosemary, purple rice, smoked manchego milk and balls of guava 

For dessert we had:
-  pb and j: some kind of craziness with peanut butter, fresh berries, and ritz cracker ice cream
- chocolate chunk bread pudding: with fresh berries delivered that morning, some kind of delicious cream and a bit of ginger

The menu changes all the time, so I can't guarantee that you'll be able to eat what we ate if you go, but I do know that you'll enjoy it much.

We went on a Thursday night around 7pm and the place was pretty empty.  The service was a bit on the slow side so be prepared for a leisurely meal if you go.",5
Restaurants,"Nice atmosphere and though I have only seen it from afar they have recently added an outdoor seating area-more hip lounge than the leather and fireplace den-like style that makes up the main part of the restaurant. Can't believe I live close to this place and have never been in.  My group had drinks and wine. Service was pleasant, wine was tasteful. I recommend the Belli-tini. My friend go this berry laden martini and I plan on trying it next time I'm there...",4
Restaurants,"Underwhelmed, yes I'd say this word sums up my experience.  However, I will expand.  We were here last night for dinner and I was a bit disappointed to find Chef Kevin Souza who just arrived here weeks ago has now moved on again to Nine on Nine (3rd move this summer for this talented chef).  The space is very nice.  It is full of deep reds which automatically relax and a nice dining area.  The bar next to the dining area is a little bizarre because the seats are too low to the ground and force you to feel like your sitting at the kiddies table with you barely able to put your elbows on the bar.  I asked about the ackward seating and was told it has to do with them buying a bar that was too tall and insurance issues on getting properly fitted seating.  They have great big leather seats for lounging with your cocktails which are a nice touch.  They've also recently added outdoor and rooftop seating which is great on a warm autumn day.  The service was a little below average.  We had a very unenthusiastic chap named Mick who didn't commit any major faux pas, but it was clear this was not were he wanted to be.  The wine selection is okay.  They have a few more expensive interesting options, but the waiter didn't offer any suggestions or seemed trained at all on the description of the bottles.  The bread was okay. I'm guessing breadworks bread served with this interesting pomogranite and onion butter.  The flavors worked okay for the butter, but I would have been more pleased if the butter and bread were served warm.  I ordered the salmon tartare which had a nice flavor seasoned with cilantro and mango, however the fish itself was a little warmer than room temperature.  This is not good for tartare. It should be served slightly chilled.  Fiona had the scallop appetizer which was served on this extremely bland breadcrumb type pancake.  The scallop itself was delicious and cooked perfectly however for $12 I think one deserves more than one average sized scallop.  I had the lamb chops which were cooked perfectly and very flavorful, however the greens that accompanied were bland.  They don't put salt and pepper on the tables which is okay and I've been to other fine dining where this occurs.  However, if they won't provide the flavor enhancers they should be spot on with the seasoning.  Red room is not.  Fiona had the strip steak which was $42. This seems a bit much for strip.  It was very fatty and had a weird chemical flavor. I'm guessing from a charcoal bricket.  It was edible, but I've had better steaks at TGIF.  We skipped dessert.  The bill including tip was $180.  This place is overpriced for the quality of food and serving size.  I'd be okay paying this cost if I was trying something unique like I was hoping for with Chef Souza, however they have re employed an old sous chef who is now doing the cooking and in my opinion does not justify the cost.  It's a shame because I'm sure they've put a lot of money in overhauling the restaurant, but this won't be a top notch restaurant until they get better talent in the kitchen or reduce their prices.  This place probably deserves 2.5 stars.",3
Restaurants,"I really enjoyed my meal at Red Room.  Very unassuming from the outside, which seems to be the way of things in Pittsburgh.

I started with a salad... can't quite remember which one it was, except that it was good.  I also had the strip steak, which was excellent.  I didn't particularly care for the pickled veggies on the side, but if I stayed away from that, then it was fine.  We had the bread pudding for dessert, which was divine.  I'd come back just for that.

Atmosphere is dark and cozy, but the tables are far enough apart that you don't have to worry about being too romantic with the people at the table over.  Service is good.",4
Restaurants,"came here for a triple birthday and the only thing i liked about this place was that a lot of my friends were there. i know it's supposed to be more up-scale but shit, this place is still in east lib territory where i can get cheaper drinks at kelly's bar and shadow (including a cover). i waited for 10 mins to order a drink even though there was barely anyone at the bar and 3 bartenders. i can get quicker service at phi bar at its fullest capacity with one bartender.",2
Restaurants,Really nice atmosphere. The catering services were very impressive. Delicious soup and desserts. High quality and flavorful. I'd definitely return!,4
Restaurants,"I met friends for dinner at 2Red, the lounge half of Red Room.  The upstairs patio had a nice atmosphere, but the food was a bit lacking.  We bought several appetizers to share.  

- The blackened shrimp enchiladas didn't have much flavor.
- The red bean hummus was so so
- The gorgonzola port fondue was pretty tasty and very, very rich.  

Maybe the regular menu has more to offer.",3
Restaurants,"I dug it.  5$ Mojito happy hour special in the 2red lounge half was AMAZING, like, really good mojito with lots of alcohol.  I had the port-gorgonzola fondue and it was very tasty.  It came with bread and meat, and I kind of wish it had been cheaper and only come with bread, because I liked the bread + fondue better than the meat + fondue.  

It was comfy and quiet in there and our waitress was nice and changed the channel on one of the tvs from espn to the news for me.  There was hardly anyone there (reasonable at 4P on thursday) which is actually probably part of why I liked it so much-- it was quiet.",4
Restaurants,"The red room and accompanying lounge are very nice spaces, with a darker modern decor, it's a great place to hang out and have a drink, but you should go somewhere else for food. The menu reads nicely but the execution is a bit clumsy, and the service takes years. 

so grab a couch a libation, and hang out, just dont open that menu",2
Restaurants,"I really wanted to like this place.  I really did.  But the high prices, snooty wait staff and completely wrong-headed ""creativity"" of the chef (wrong-headed combinations of flavors) just turned me off.",1
Restaurants,"Ducked into this place while waiting for a table at Abay around the corner.  

$25 for a glass of House Red  and a Kettle One tonic.  Where are we - NYC - LA?? ? 

Not to mention  - the waitstaff practically made me beg for it!   Waited for close to 10 min then had to stalk /chase one of the 2 bartenders to the other side of the bar.    The kicker is..... the bar had like 10 empty tables and the bar seating was 1/2 full!!!! 

Hahahahahahahahaha


1st  - time you get me - shame on you.... 
2nd-  time.... shame on me... 

Won't be a second time....  and that's unfortunate cause it looks like it has potential.  ()based off of other reviews here - maybe I overstated its potential!!)

Not to mention  - in a shady (not shadyside - and can't even justify those prices there), if not the shadiest part of town.",1
Restaurants,"This business has closed, and judging by the ""sheriff's sale"" postings, it will not be reopening... 

Gone is the pleasure of the proprietors and waitstaff x-raying your wallet and checking how expensive your shoes look as you enter, that is, if they pay you any attention at all. No more sitting drinkless as the only customers during ""happy"" hour, while the owner shmoozes a liquor vendor (a woman who repeatedly used the word ""zing-fen-dale,"" no joke) in the comfy lounge seats next to you. 

Someone needs to get the message: upscale (real or imagined) is not the only way to succeed on the developing East Liberty/Shadyside edge, no matter how desperately the Red Rooms and Richard Chens of the world may think so. Also, Pittsburgh can support only so many ersatz upscale restaurants, thank god. 

Good riddance, Red Room...",2
Restaurants,Planned on going here this past weekend. We all showed up and found a 'sheriff sale' notice on the door. I would say it's a safe bet that we'll not be experiencing this place again.,3
Restaurants,"I visited Dish 1st week of September. The one thing I realized about this place was how overpriced everything was. Breakfast burrito - $9? Grilled chicken that was laying out in the deli  (no sauce or condiments) $8? There is another place like Dish that sells the exact same chicken for $5. I order the pizza at the restaurant and it was a really salty. I should have just went to Domino's.

I really had a hard time believing the prices they are charging for a grilled sandwich (almost $10) to pasta. Are you kidding me? Then I realized I'm in Scottsdale where people will eat anything in front of them as long as that place looks trendy (see Olive and Ivy). 

The concept is pretty good. You can pick up stuff for home if you don't have time to make anything. I think the prices are restaurant prices for a take out place. 

I think the location of Dish will attract considerable traffic. It's a huge place that offers pick up and a sit down restaurant. Most of the employees knew what they were talking about and were friendly. But, it's vastly overpriced for what they offer.

Update 9/12/07: People have said that the food is pricey, but it's Scottsdale...so it comes with the territory. That's what's wrong with most people. Location should not justify the prices, the food should. Actually, I don't mind spending money if the food is worth it (in fact, my favorite local seafood restaurant is Wildfish, not inexpensive). 

But, the food is alright compared to the prices. If you're a bit lazy and can't make a sandwich yourself at home, then by all means..spend $10+ for a sandwich here.  I think this is definitely catering to the right crowd.  This place is a larger, overpriced LGO with marginal food. I've tried the pizza, grilled chicken sandwich, burrito, and sushi. All were OK.  Perhaps, I am fortunate that my client/work pays whenever I go there. I think there are other places I would go to spend my OWN money.

I think Dish will do well because of it's location and because it is Scottsdale..where most people don't have a discerning taste bud.  

One positive thing I will say is that it's a quick, easy place to get a meal and the employees seem knowledgeable about what they sell. So, if you're not in the mood to cook or even sure what to eat, but want a myriad of overpriced choices then Dish is for you. 

Again, this is a personal opinion. I'm not trying to offend anyone.",2
Restaurants,"I drive past  this place at least once every day, and assumed it was going to be just another sit down overly trendy Gainey restaurant.  What it actually is completely surprised me.  The best way I can describe it is the deli counter at AJs on steroids.  

Just from what I saw they have salads, sandwiches, a hot carving station, an ice cream counter, a bakery, sushi, gourmet cheese, wine and pretty much any kind of side you could want from hummus to pasta salad.

Being in a rush, I opted for a ready made chicken ceasar .  Henri is right, it's not fast food-y type cheap ($9 for a meal-sized salad, and, i think, $6 without chicken), but it's also a lot better than you'd get from a drive-thru.  Along with the fresh greens and tasty dressing, you get nearly an entire chicken breast that actually tastes like someone tried to make it taste good, which is pretty unique for many take-away chicken ceasars.

While mainly a take-away establishment, they do have some limited seating.

So,  if you're like me and work in the Gainey area and are really looking to get away from fast food for lunch and a place where you can quickly grab a variety of different tasty things for lunch, this place is an awesome choice.  If you're looking for fine dining, you'll probably be disappointed.",5
Restaurants,"Their full name is ""Dish. A Food Experience.""  And that is pretty much what it is.

There is just so.much.food.  There are prepared meals, a deli part, a grill, groceries, a bakery,  fromaggier, desserts, wine, champagne, a coffee and breakfast bar and oh yeah, a full service bistro after 5.  The sandwich that I had was very good, all the ingredients fresh and the sourdough bread was delicious.  (I would go back to try some of their other breads.)  My husband chose sushi and found it to be ok, but it was probably a poor choice given all of the options available.  We split a Tuscan pasta salad that we didn't like, there was too much vinegar.  

The desserts, however, were outstanding.  I chose one of their chocolate filled cupcakes and it was better than any cupcake I've had out here yet.  The tiramisu was also quite good, and my husband enjoyed his latte.  On our way out I noticed that they had individual s'mores which I will be trying on my next trip!

It's a great place to stop for lunch, or maybe to pick up something for dinner if you don't feel like cooking.  I would also go back to get food if we were entertaining for cheeses and whatnot.

Oh, and just so you know the map here on Yelp is wrong.  Its not on  the corner of Scottsdale and McDonald like it suggests, but its at the corner of Scottsdale and Gainey Ranch/Via de Ventura, which is further north.",4
Restaurants,"I looked around the market part, but did not buy or eat anything. Instead we went to the restaurant/bar side and it was great.  They are a wine store, so when eating at the restaurant you can get bottles of wine for pretty cheap. It was only $18 for a bottle and the bread that comes on the table is amazing. The three of us ordered a pizza to split (this was a happy hour thing) and the pizza was so good. I can see how it is expensive if you buy things per pound in the market, but as for a restaurant, it was very reasonably priced and the food was delicious. THe bar part is totally seperate from the market so the atmosphere is really nice. I would definately go again",5
Restaurants,"I love this place.

They have the best DIY salads ever. I am seriously head over heels in love with the ""create your own"" salad concept. They also have a sandwhich station, which is like an awesome upscale Subway, as well as a pasta station. 

And the filled cupcakes. FILLED! My biggest complaint about most cupcakes in that all the yummy frosting is on top. Well, dish makes cupcakes with frosting in the middle. Heaven.

Dish is clean, sunny and spacious with very friendly and helpful staff. I never have to wait too long in the salad line and they are really cool about letting you sample before you buy. I have not eaten in the formal sit down section of Dish, but the DIY stations, bakery, coffee bar and deli case are all top notch.

Just thinking about Dish makes me want my butter lettuce/white bean/broccoli/asaparagus/roasted pepper/almond/cheese/shrimp salad with house dressing. So good.",4
Restaurants,"Having been a frequent visitor of dIsh since it's inception (did it seem like the build out took forever?) I feel like it is time to knock out a review.  Overall, I've been impressed.  There were a few kinks to workout in the beginning---whose idea was the bulk food section?  And who can forget the floor debacle?  You'd walk into the dining room side and the floor was like a skating rink. Amazed that didn't result in a slip and fall lawsuit.  

Now that they have a few months under their belts, I think they've begun to hit their stride.  The naan bread brisket sandwich is top of the recommend list (avoid the Reuben) and the salad and cold sandwich side has yet to disappoint.  For breakfast, I developed a serious addiction to the three blueberry pancakes---some of the best around.  My other frequent purchases are the hummus and the tabbouleh salad.  The only experience I've avoided so far is the sit down dinner service in the evening.  Frankly, I'd rather schlep the 25 yards down to bloom.  But never say never.....and when they start serving martini's (I've not heard anything re: their alcohol license---they had beer and wine at opening but weren't sanctioned for liquor) I imagine I will visit the bar a time or two.

My advice to the dIsh executive suite (that's you Darren!)--Consider something late-night.  You've got a steady stream of people heading from Old Town to NoSco from 11ish to 2ish who are looking for an evening bite that is not In-N-Out.  Something to consider.......",4
Restaurants,"For what it is, it's great. A gourmet style take out marketing with eat in dining area and bistro. I loved the look and feel of the market. It reminded me of Dean and Deluca in NYC. The one in Soho. I ordered a ""malke your own salad"" at the salad bar and a sushi roll. I was dying to try their sushi so I ordered both and took some to go. the salad bar was great I ordered tons of veggies, some cheese, a hard boiled egg and a piece of grilled chicken it was $8.  I think a fair price for a huge ass salad. The sushi on the other hand was mediocre. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and well I won't be getting sushi there again. The fish was fresh although the rice was not right. I'd say the sashimi would be a better bet. The did carry my favorite water from tuscany Acqua Panna although it seemed a bit pricing at $1.75 for the 16.9 oz bottle. Either way I recommend checking out dish. I think you'll agree it's a diamond in the rough.",3
Restaurants,"This place is ambitious:  they bake their own bread, churn their own gelato, make salads, sandwiches, pastas and stir-fries to order, and offer a huge selection of gourmet grab and go foods.  Starting at 5pm, the bistro to the side offers a hit-list of American favorites like burgers and grilled tuna as well as a full bar.

We chose to eat from the take-out side and ordered the fish of the day from the grill.  $8 includes two sides and a house-baked roll.  We ordered the salmon fillet grilled medium-rare with drunken beans (pinto cooked in beer) and mac-n-cheese.  By the time we had paid at the register and walked back to the grill, our food was ready,

The salmon was cooked perfectly with nice char marks on the outside and pink on the inside.  The pinto beans were tasty enough to be a dish in itself.  The mac-n-cheese was actually fusilli-n-cheese which probably works better because the twists in the fusilli help it to stay al dente longer.

We contemplated having the buttermilk panna cotta for dessert but when we saw that it didn't wiggle when shaken, we opted for the gelato instead.  3 bucks for a small cup of pistachio and coffee, which the guy behind the counter packed way high.

We plan to come back for happy hour which is apparently offered all day on Thursday.",4
Restaurants,"I really dig Dish!

I would agree with all of the reviews that came before met that the salads are kick ass!  There are not too many places that you can design your own salad with every ingredient that you want, and it is always fresh and delicious!  I've also enjoyed the gourmet-to-go salmon, hummus, sweet potato, and beef ribs.  I've never been disappointed!

So, it sounds like sushi is not their forte... I will stay away from that and stick to everything else. It's expensive, but it's exactly as the name says, ""a food experience.""  I've dined in the sit-down side once and food was good / service was slow... I've also had to wait a few times in the 'take-out' side for a cashier to open up and ring up my food.  Aside from those minor negatives, I'll continue to hit up the 'take-out' side for sure... as a matter of fact, i may make the drive over there for lunch today!",4
Restaurants,"It's yuppie, full of rich White people and I love it.  The food is awesome (the Southwest burger with green chillies and avocado) and they have great specials and a full bar.  I can't comment on the groceries but I'm glad it's way up in North Scottsdale or I'd be there all the time.",4
Restaurants,"They have good breakfast, who knew?  I must have driven by this place a zillion times (okay, that is clearly an exaggeration) , but never stopped in until one random Saturday morning after being, uhhhh... ""stranded"" at a ""friends"" house for the night.  He lived just up the street from dish, so we made our way there for breakfast.  The menu is limited, but my breakfast was excellent.  I also really enjoyed the modern decor.  I am not often in this part of town for breakfast, but it definitely has my approval.  Check it out.",4
Restaurants,"Dish is.... closed!

I was about to whip up a written tour of this gigantic and ambitious space, but it's too late.

Looks like Dish had a severe case of bad timing: http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/2008/07/14/20080714dishclosing.html 

Too bad, after the enormous investment and effort!",4
Restaurants,"I give them a 2 not a 1 because they actually had the best ribs ever!. They were over priced and the corn bread and various other things had trans fat in it. I confronted the president to alert them of my finding. 
I told them I saw it listed in the ingredients on the corn bread. 
Then questioned why have a bakery and have fresh baked bread when your using the ingredients of a sit on the shelf forever and not go bad bread?

She wrote back and told me they called the chef and they dont use it. 
WTF?
Its on the ingredients on the package, you idiot.
She didnt even know what was in the food so she told me a lie.

Weird, they didnt even make a lot of the stuff there. Thats why she didnt know",2
Restaurants,"Like the restaurant says, it's a primarily based noodle shop covering asian, american, and italian.  I didn't expect too much since it looks like a typical fast food restaurant that you see at a shopping mall.  Well, needless to say it really wasn't much. 

I ordered a Pad Thai when I first went there.  And it was tasteless.  Gave it a second try and ordered one of their recommended dishes.  It was better tasting than the Pad Thai, but not by much.  I pretty much bought a $11 dollar stomach ache. 

I'd rather heat up some cheap ramen in a microwave.",2
Restaurants,"I really do like this place! I loove the pad thai! it's really filling and yummy! I don't care for the key lime pie, it's too sour for me. 

I also love the pear and  baby spinach salad, that's always amazing! I've been going there for a couple of years now and is one of my favorite resturants.",3
Restaurants,"I was not impressed with this place much.  It is nice that they offer tofu as an alternative to meat for add-on's in your noodles.  However, vegetarians beware: they cook on the same surfaces, and the tofu took 10 minutes longer to arrive than my other friends' chicken dishes.  The specials have decent prices, when you do a combo.  Otherwise, I think this place is over-priced and avoidable.",1
Restaurants,"Bad, bad, bad... No breadsticks, no silverware, no clean tables. I think this place is gonna be closing it's doors very soon.",1
Restaurants,"Okay, so for the most part the food seems edible, however I wouldn't recommend getting the Asian dishes. You don't go to Mexican food place and get a burger, don't go here and get Pad Thai. First of all it was served with a lemon instead of a lime and the eggs were all in one big clump. It was as if I ordered scrambled egg with noodles. I wasn't impressed.  I might go back and try something else . . . if I didn't have any other options.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I'm more of an enthusiast than an expert but the PSO was one of my favorite things about Pittsburgh in winter.

Despite the fact that they were between music directors and had a series of guest conductors (or maybe because they were in transition) every performance I went to (except maybe one) was very exciting. The whole hall vibrates with a cozy intensity and the seasons have been very varied - classics, modern stuff, interesting guests - so we always found one or two performances that we really wanted to hear.

The cheap last minute tickets are a great deal, and if you look presentable, they'll put you in the dress-circle.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"When I was kid, we would go to the symphony on almost a monthly basis. They have really great guests that rotate through fairly regularly. 

The hall itself is simply beautiful and very comfortable, its certainly a great aspect of the city and worthwhile thing to make a point to experience.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Cheers!

Great music, great music director.  They take chances and do some of the all time favorites.  

Lucky to have such a well respected orchestra in Pittsburgh.

Everyone should try to find a concert they like and go at least once a year!   Some of the Pops series and guests are so much fun.  Even the kids like it.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Cheers!

The PSO Pops can be fun and they do different themes and have different artists that make it more interesting.  You can pick a theme and artist that is of your interest.

Dave Koz performance was wonderful.  Gregg Karukas was assisting.  Get night, lots of foot tapping.  For those that like jazz, this was a fun night.

Also had a choir made up of some of the better voices from about 8 local colleges and universities.  They were great.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"We are very fortunate in Pittsburgh to have one of the best symphonies in the country here in our hometown!  My wife and I subscribe to the Pops series and enjoy the talented musicians and performers they bring in.  Subscribing has been a great benefit, as they are very flexible allowing us to change concert dates either to another night in a concert weekend, or changing to another show altogether.  We enjoyed the support Marvin Hamlisch gave the symphony and look forward to what his legacy holds in the future!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I had a really unique experience seeing the PSO with Ben Folds back in June. he did many of his regular hits and his new piano concerto. he was able to have the PSO do a rendition of his concert classic ""Rock this b*tch""-which was just so awesome to see a classical orchestra playing along with him.  I'd recommend looking for what other unique shows the PSO has throughout the year like this one. It provides for a different experience than a typical performance.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"So I may not be 100% in love with their main venue, but I can promise that I'll never speak a bad word against the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, or PSO as I'll be calling them for this review. This orchestra was founded in 1895 and it's one of our city's greatest sources of pride and joy. It's also a world-renowned performance group, meaning that any show of theirs you see will be excellent. And boy, does the PSO offer show options! Whether you want to enjoy a classical music performance or see the music from your favorite video game performed live, chances are that you can buy tickets for that show thanks to the PSO. Just a few of their performance options include their regular holiday pops show, a variety of live musical movies (where the orchestra accompanies the movie playing on a screen above them), and a range of special concerts that include a lot of non-classical period cultural items (including Pokemon, video games, Disney, etc.). 

The PSO also does educational and community engagement shows throughout the year, both at Heinz Hall and in the community; I've seen some of the artists at the Carnegie Science Center during 21+ Nights, for example. But really, you need to see at least one show at Heinz Hall; even I go back to this venue despite the fact that it's not my favorite, all for the PSO. There are really no words to describe how excellent the PSO is - they just have to be experienced. So seriously: go check out their calendar and grab a ticket, and don't forget to enjoy a concert prelude workshop if you can (which begins one hour prior to certain concerts). And if you don't love them, the citizens of Pittsburgh reserve the right to ask you to move elsewhere. ;)",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I am a complete fan of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and I attend many of their concerts.  I was lucky to take a tour of their building, and on one of the walls backstage I saw a picture of Richard Strauss with the PSO from when he appeared with them as a guest conductor.  That's just one example of the rich history and tradition of the Orchestra.  But the Symphony continues to make history and remains one of the top 10 orchestras in the United States. 

If you are attending a concert, the sound is excellent particularly up in the balcony.  If you are sitting underneath the balcony, I don't feel you are getting the complete richness of sound that you get elsewhere in the hall.  So you best bet is about row N and forward downstairs or anywhere up top.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"What's not to love about having one of the top orchestras in the U.S. located in Pittsburgh?

I probably attend the Pittsburgh Symphony performances 10+ times per year.  In the last year, I have seen the BNY Grand Mellon Classics concert, POPs, and a few performances that I cannot categorize.  The Symphony always sounds great, though some of their programming I enjoy more than others.

My favorite concerts are the Grand Classics.  They are usually pretty empty, which is disappointing, but the Symphony always does a great job.  Any concerts with Concertmaster Noah Bendix-Bagley are always amazing, but he is sadly moving on in his career.  Also, I really enjoyed the West Side Story movie with live music a few weeks ago as well.  And kudos to the conductor for using that crazy system to keep the orchestra with the movie.

While I am in the right demographic for POPs, I have despised these concerts since childhood.  I don't enjoy them.  The last one I saw was Sci-Fi themed.  The orchestra was great, but the tacky lighting and bringing in George Takei (while cool) was too gimmicky for my tastes.

Overall, a great way to spend an afternoon or an evening!  The tickets aren't as inexpensive as the opera, but it is still much less expensive to go to the Symphony than a Steelers game.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I love the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra; I do.  I love their home venue of Heinz Hall.

However, I was disappointed with the setup on stage this last visit for the performance of the music for the Oscars.  Maybe I just didn't notice before or maybe I hadn't felt it was as critical before but the stage setup was awful.  

On stage were both the orchestra and multiple rows of choir members.  Now, mind you they got the setup right for the choir -- they were elevated and tiered such that you could see each individual member of the choir.  The orchestra, however?  They were all flat-lined level with one another and stacked several rows deep.  I imagine sitting in cheaper balcony seats would be the better option.  We were sitting in the center of the orchestra section and had a grand view of the stage, that is to say we had a grand view of the conductor, the first row of violins and the entire choir.  

Maybe that would have been ok except there were many times the integral instrument being played and the focus of our attention was on some other instrument besides the front row violinists.  I could see part of a flute when the flutist had a major role; I could see part of the piano when the pianist was playing.  No amount of straining could elevate me to a position of seeing who and what was being played.  

The sound was wonderful; the conductor super; the venue awesome; the staff polite, courteous, and helpful.  But, I cannot help feeling I might as well listened to the performance on the radio; being there in person did nothing to enhance the experience without being able to see the performers perform.

Will I go again?  Yes.  But if I experience the same setup, probably not after that.",3
Arts & Entertainment,I saw the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra perform in concert as apart of Dollar Bank's Three Rivers Arts Festival. I received a free general admission ticket as part of a class I was enrolled in at Carnegie Mellon University. I attended the concert on 10 JUN of 2013 at 7pm,5

Public Services & Government,"The Tempe police department is such a corrupt system. They think the are God's on this earth who are unstoppable. They can do whatever they want and there's not a single person that can do anything about it. Less the 5 hours ago the story begins. Me and a group of people were out for a friends birthday party. We bought a table at el hefe to celebrate, everyone was having a great time until someone from the crowd started to get to aggressive with a girl we were with. The guy was trying to pull her off the table to dance with him after she told him no several time he got angry and and tried to get on the table. Once he got up someone who was in our group told him to leave and get off the table, the guy got angry and pulled him off and started pushing him, our friend wasnt going to allow that so he pushed him back and someone got security. Security escorted the guy out. This all happened 10 mins before the club closed, so after we all had to leave the bar we were walking outside to get a taxi to go back to our hotel. On our way to the street the fellow who got escorted out was waiting. He started running across the road with a friend to attack our friend. They grabbed him and pushed him on the ground. Someone else in our group grabbed the attackers friend and pulled him off while myself tried to break up the fight going on with the other two. My friend who was doing nothing but trying to break up the fight then got pepper spray by an officer who had no idea what was going on. The officer ran into the scene which wasn't even bad and did that. He used such unbelievable excessive force. There was at least 6-8 office right there and there was no reason for them to use pepper spray. They then grabbed my friend who's was trying to break up the fight and tackled him to the ground, handcuffed him and Sat him on the curb. He was in unbelievable pain and he was begging for water and they would not even listen to him, they were just watching him suffer. After going over to the police and trying to explain what happen they told me to back up or I would be arrested next. I would not leave because they arrested him for no reason. I told them over and over he was just trying to break up a fight. There responds was ''well he's not the f**king cop is he''. They then took him down to the police station we're he is right now. I tried calling the jail house to bail him out and explain again what happened and they told me to stop calling and that my friend probably desevered it. The worst part is that they sprayed him on a public side walk were a ton of people got hit by the over spray. Everybody was in pain, they didn't even think about anybody else. A female friend still has it on her face, after trying to wash it off it only got worse. The police in this city are such a waste. I understand that they probably deal with drunken morons all the time but that doesn't give them the right to treat everybody like this. They didn't even ask what was going on, I had 4 witnesses trying to help but it did absolutely nothing. The worst part is the original attacker didn't even get in trouble. Sorry for my rant but our voices need to be heard, maybe one day the police will not be aloud to get away with anything.",1

Ich liebe Winter in Phoenix.

The winter makes me enamored so, so much so that I want to proclaim I love winter in Phoenix in romance languages.

Let's face it.  We all love this time of year as the 70 degree days makes us the envy of the nation for a few months.  Here are some additional reasons to love Winter in Phoenix beyond the obvious great weather.

* Outdoor festivals galore
* Luminarias at the Desert Botanical Garden
* MLB Spring Training in March
* PF Changs Rock n Roll Marathon
* Endless hiking opportunities
* FBR Open and the Bird's Nest
* Hotties from Minnesota and Chicago who are snowbirding it (I'd hit it)

And best of all...
* The hibernation of Swamp-Ass until April.",5
Local Flavor,"Today I am writing from NY. Here is a Haiku to describe the situation:

29 degrees

Jet Blue take me to AZ

It's cold as balls here",5
Local Flavor,"I love the PHX in winter!
I grew up in Buffalo NY, so no matter what time of year (yes, even summer!) I deserve to live here!
I'm out walking my 'hood today, just back from Thanksgiving in the OC.  It's sunny, a bit breezy, and....*gasp*...no jacket!  In November!
My parents finally came to Arizona in April to settle in Payson.  One thing they always remark on...the sunsets in AZ!
I've lived everywhere around the world, and I've decided Phoenix is where I'm stayin'!",5
Local Flavor,"I'll use the word ""winter"" loosely, for, you see, winter isn't winter to me without some sort of white falling flakes from the sky. Nor is it winter without some sort of annoyance, like scrapping frost off your windshield or slipping on the occasional ice patch. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't miss bruised tail bones or shivering to my bones while I wait for my car to heat up. I do, however, miss the change - the crispness in the air, the stark white backdrop to a new day, the trees bending under the weight of Mother Nature. I miss the cycle: life, death, rebirth, celebration. 

Extract all that from my brain (my own frame of reference) and I'll agree: Phoenix is absolutely great between the months of December and April. May's not even that bad, but can you call May a ""winter"" month? 

That's where I become disgruntled. You see, December weather in Phoenix is like fall weather where I used to live. October weather in Phoenix is like spring. I can't seem to keep track of my days here. Months cease to matter. I don't like that very much. 

Add in the concept of ""hot as ballz"" during the summertime, and any months outside the range of absurdity are going to seem like pure bliss. But, c'mon, it's all relative. 

Sure, I may rate ""winter"" in Phoenix 4 stars, but that's only because it's the only time of the year I don't feel like I'm drowning in my own sweat. It's the only time of the year I can enjoy walking outside, exploring Central Phoenix and other pockets of interest. It's the only time I can expect to need (hopefully) an umbrella (minus the scary monsoon season) or thicker jacket. Maybe even a scarf and gloves! It's the only time I will get to see my own breath, lingering long enough in front of my nose to remind me that, let's face it, these cooler temps are only temporary. What awaits around the corner is the worst kind of pain. Oh, the torment. Oh, the antagonizing sun. Oh, the hell that'll never end. Summer, how I rue thee!",4
Local Flavor,"Ahhh, Phoenix winters. Just nice enough to justify buying entire lots of ""light sweaters"" and just cold enough to give me a cold every two weeks from wearing said sweaters.

Winter, my weakened immune system and I commend you.",5
Local Flavor,I'm freezing ... I'd much rather melt than freeze.  Brrrrrrr.,1
Local Flavor,"I love winter in Phoenix. The cold, the rain, the clouds -- I LOVE CLOUDY DAYS.

I don't like what winter brings with it, though -- Uggs.
Seriously, girls, you looking fucking ridiculous. It's 55 outside and you're wearing huge furry boots. If you tried that shit somewhere up north when it was 55 degrees, you'd get laughed out of town.

I get it. You think they look cool and you're dying to wear them. But you know what? You live in Arizona. You don't get to wear huge, fuzzy boots. Get over it.",5
Local Flavor,"Seriously.

This
kicks
ass.

I just talked to my sister, who informed me that in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, it is -30*.  

But at the same time, I'm still wondering how I'll make it through summer.  We didn't get here until July this year.

Eek.",5
Local Flavor,"They should rename Winter in Phoenix ""Hoodie Time.""  That's all it is: time to put on a hoodie and get on with your day.  Every year I get three months to forget exactly how miserable summer can be.  On the flipside, somewhere in the middle of July I forget how outstanding Hoodie Time is so, when it arrives, I spend two or three weeks with a big fat smile stuck on my face.

Tomorrow's forecast hovers at a wonderful 56 degrees.  Hoodie Time's final gasp?",5
Local Flavor,Winter in Phoneix rox! Nuff said!,5
Local Flavor,"I'm tired of the rain and cold.  In Phoenix.  I've got my electric blanket on and even my dog is sleeping on the bed to keep warm!

Why?
Why?
Why?
Still better than Buffalo, that's for sure!",4

Dear Slush Puddles in the South End,

I'm so sorry to hear you are getting 10 inches of snow on New Year's Eve.  I know how much of a pain it is to have an awesome outfit all planned out only to have to prepare it for the snow.  I know that getting a cab on a night like this can be an impossible feat.  

May your closed toe shoes not get messed up, may your hair style stay in place in the snow and wind, may the bouncer at the bar/club not make you wait for long outside and may you not step in any slush puddles over a foot deep.  Chin up, NYE only means 4 more months of winter!

Happy New Year!

Love,

Bare legs and open toes in Phoenix",5
Local Flavor,umm nothing beats it. why else do snow birds flock here for the winter?,5
Local Flavor,"Born and raised here, got smart and leave for the summers.  I LOVE Phoenix in the winter!  Green grass, cool weather flowers, glorious sun, resort wear, swimming, cocktails by an outdoor fire vs snow boots, scraping the windshield of ice, wearing tons of clothes and sitting in front of a ""sad"" light.  Lets see, thats a tough one!   One nice cashmere sweater will fix this little bit of cold we are experiencing.",5
Local Flavor,"I'm loving this place!!! this is why people move here. a little rain, and not much more. the sun shines when the snow falls elsewhere. i can ride my bike in January...un-heard of on the east. i like that i get to wear a sweater, wigs and sometimes gloves-because i'm an accessories W----re. i now have the train at my beck and call...its making the city an even more beautiful place to be. i should stop complimenting this place or our population will triple again. YIKES. thankfully the sprawl has losts its glow and we are moving on up!!! the downtown sky rises and new housing is doing wonders for the city. i remember when the sunset=desolate baren city of phoenix, not anymore!!! gotta love this place, tried to leave so many times, but always end up right back here. maybe i'll stay....maybe.",5

Local Flavor,"Don't go Winter. Please. Pretty please. I mean I know you have to go eventually. To make way for your evil twin. Summer. That bitch. I'm just asking if you can linger until July 4th. Then I'll be ready for three digit temps, scorching sun rays and melting steering wheels. I just want to party with your 70 degree self a wee bit longer. Thanks for listening Winter. You've been good to me so far...",5
Local Flavor,"Wait, what?  Winter is over?  I....didn't even know it had come.

Winters in Michigan are spawned by the devil himself.  They are demonic devices used to torture people on the east side of the country, for whatever reason.  

Why would such a thing as frozen car door handles even exist?  Who does that to people?  The devil, that's who.

Where does 'Black Ice' come from?  That's not even a normal type of ice.  Only the devil can conjure up something like that.

And what about freezing windshields?  Huh?  Who freezes the windshield...INSIDE OF THE FREAKIN' CAR?!?!?!  

THE DEVIL, THAT'S WHO!!!!

Seriously, the winters here make the blistering summers an afterthought.  This is as close to paradise as is possible on Earth.  I couldn't believe that I was able to give away my winter coat for good.  

Hoodies as coats.  No need for Lugz boots.  Thermal underwear shouldn't even be sold here.",5
Local Flavor,"Distance makes the heart grow fonder, right?",5
Local Flavor,"Winter in Phoenix, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. When I am sweating in 120 degree summer weather, I think longingly to the 7 months out of the year that are a delicious 75 degrees. 

I love the smell of winter in Phoenix, yes the smell. It smells like orange blossoms and this perfume scent surprises me with every twist and turn. 

While I hate how they drive (can we please have a driving lane designated for snow birds?), I love how they make the streets come alive and make the businesses, events and festivals come together for entertainment of every shape and size. 

I love that I can wear sundresses in December. 

I love how I can climb Camelback Mountain in the dead of winter wearing nothing but shorts and a light pullover. 

I love all the events that happen, including the Fiesta Bowl, WM Open, Barrett Jackson and Spring Training. 

I love waking up in the morning and opening up my doors to a fresh breeze and birds chirping. 

I love that I can host parties on my patio in December. 

I love that I can read a book on my patio in December. 

I don't love the cost of living in the winter, but I do love that because of the tourist population in the winter months, the resorts can offer steal of deals in the summer for their loyal locals. 

I don't care what your opinion of Phoenix is. This city has amazing weather the majority of the year, tourists flock here to visit and we have every type of terrain just a drive away. #liveandlovelocal",5
Local Flavor,"Having lived in many cold weather climates throughout my years I have come to a realization, I am not a fan of shoveling snow. Seriously, who wants to do that? You start at one end of your property and by the time you finish you have to start all over again! 

Yeah, shorts on Christmas is a nice bonus too. Seriously, Phoenix in the winter is the bees knees.",5
Local Flavor,"It was like a vestige as a hummingbird fluttered in the blooming plant in my entryway as I left my Phoenix home for the last time in January.  I remember conscienciously thinking ""good bye palm tree, good bye outdoor swimming pool, good bye golf course, good bye"", as I drove away and headed for my dismal hotel by the airport.  Though a great adventure was ahead of me, I couldn't help but drop a tear as I watched my last Phoenix sunset for a long time.  It radiated pink and purple that day as if it was putting on a show just for me, with Camelback and the Papagoes as the backdrop.  

The people, oh the fabulous people that inhabit Phoenix, come to life in winter.  We have events, parties and conventions that are hard to beat...The Waste Management Open, The Super Bowl and even the nerdy International Science and Engineering Fair.  And I can't leave out the anticipation of spring training Cactus League baseball.  People flock to us in winter be it for the sunshine or whatever, I personally think it is for the nice people.  Don't listen to the foolish news, that loves to talk of our strange politics... I guess that is part of the allure in this wild part of the west as well.  

If you venture to the beautiful valley of the sun in winter, don't be foolish and forget a coat.  It may be sunny by day, but until the sun comes up there is frost on the ground.  This is after all a desert and it's mood swings in winter are no joke!  

If it chances to rain, a few days later go for a hike.  The blooming cacti and desert flora will fill your nose with the most amazing pungent tropical smells.  

As I sit here freezing with a jacket, boots and scarf on at a train station typing this review, the thought of Phoenix in winter makes me smile and warm inside.",5
Restaurants,"In the heart of Old Scottsdale, Pischke's Paradise lies in wait...catching tourists and locals alike with their diverse menu, and incredible food! 

Have had everything from breakfast to steak au poivre here.  Burgers,  salads, and steaks are good, but I always seem to gravitate back to their open face sandwiches on Boboli bread.  Try the Fire Island, or the Rocky Point Shrimp. Boboli bread with chicken or shrimp in a cream sauce topped with dofino cheese. You'll thank me later.

Ultra casual atmosphere, Fat Tire on tap, great food. What more can you ask for? Not much. Look for long waits at lunch or dinner...",5
Restaurants,Awesome little place right in the heart of old town Scottsdale! For Breakfast you can't go wrong...mimosas and pancakes or what ever you like.... This Family owned (for decades) establishment offers over 300 items on their menu!  I highly recommend breakfast but they are open for lunch and dinner as well!  It's definitely a hangover heaven!  You could go in your Pj's!,5
Restaurants,"Edit: Since I reviewed this place, it has become something else and I can no longer recommend it. I'll leave my original 4 star review in tact, but I'm taking away 2 of the stars to reflect the current state of the place - overpriced pretentiousness. I'm taking away one more star because they kept the name and ditched the no-brainer existing and working formula. My review of the new place is elsewhere here on Yelp. 

Here's my original review of the original restaurant - sad to see it gone:

Fantastic breakfasts - a little on the greasy side, but it's a neat little greasy spoon in old town Scottsdale. It belongs in Seattle or Minnesota really. It's certainly a favorable alternative to a breakfast at The Breakfast Club. The staff isn't quite as pretty (but so what?) and the food is a little bit more greasy (but it's oh so good). You don't have to get dressed up to go to breakfast like you do in some of the downtown scottsdale places which is nice. 

It beats going to Denny's and it's reliable for some good food... you can't go wrong here and the crowd is diverse and make for great people-watching. Sometimes it gets really busy, but the wait usually isn't too bad.",1
Restaurants,"I was a little dissapointed with the new Pischke's. 

Admittedly I was never a huge fan of the original, so maybe I'm not the most qualified to post the first review. 

The menu was pretty limited. I had the mozzeralla and tomato sandwhich with soup. The soup was cold. The sandwhich was boring. 

Maybe I made a mistake by not going with the burger or pastrami sandwhich (both looked really good), but nothing I had made much of an impression. The service was nice, but overall the concept seemed pretty uninspired.",2
Restaurants,"I am a big fan of Robert McGrath, who purchased Pischke's and made it ""Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe."" As far as I am concerned anything he touches turns to gold. Had a great brunch there recently with three other people. All four of us totally enjoyed our meal and the service from their very professionally-trained staff. Several staff members came by -- including Chef/Owner Robert McGrath himself -- to check on us and make sure our every need was being met. The food, presentation, service was quality through and through. I will DEFINITELY be back. For those of you who do not know, Robert McGrath used to be the chef at WIndows on the Green at The Phoenician, started Roaring Fork and I am sure has many other notable accomplishments.

Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe will continue to be a great success! Treat yourself to a great dining experience! (And no, I do not work there!)",5
Restaurants,"I must agree with Scott S, but I should point out that I'm probably even less qualified to write a review of this place as I didn't eat here... I merely wandered in and right back out. 

Gone is the crowd and the long wait on a weekend morning waiting for a Pischke's greasy and tasty breakfast. Gone is the kitschy decor that gave the place character. Gone are the sassy waitresses who looked like they needed a good night sleep. Gone are the bursting menus full of good eats at reasonable prices.

Replacing all of this is a bland and boring decor, 50% fewer menu choices, and 50% higher prices. The place was pretty empty while every other breakfast place in the neighborhood (we drove past 5 others) was packed with a line going out the door. Here's a tip for Mr Robert McGrath - if you buy a successful restaurant, don't make drastic changes and jack up the prices... in other words - if it ain't broke, don't fix it. 

I'm actually kinda pissed too because I thought Pischke's was pretty good and it was definitely adding character to our city... what's there now is just another boring restaurant. There's plenty of those around here... Pischke's was unique to the area. When I visit my sister in Minnesota, she has some really neat breakfast places she takes me to that are decorated as an eclectic mess, but that blow you away with good greasy food and are dripping with atmosphere and fun. Same story when I go to San Diego or Long Beach to visit friends. Neat hip cities have neat hip breakfast joints. Well now we have one fewer. 

It's true - I haven't eaten here and perhaps Robert McGrath makes the most bomb-ass bacon and eggs this side of the equator... but it would seriously have to blow my mind to put this place back on my list of places to go. The empty seats told me the story anyway. Before I left, I told the hostess to put it back the way it was. 

I plan to actually have a meal there sometime and then post a proper review... until then, this will have to do.",1
Restaurants,"Actually 2.5 stars but I'm feeling nice today.

Ordered several things. All of them turned out to be mediocre. Good menu, poor execution. 

The price of the food compared with the actual taste/presentation of the food is the reason for 2.5 stars. The service was good, though.

Plus, my soup was cold! Ick.",3
Restaurants,"This place was perfect before it was ""upgraded"". It was a simple, kitschy, affordable, little place that had heart. It was a Scottsdale legend... Tragedy struck the family recently. So. Instead of preserving what locals had come to love (obvious if you ever tried to eat here on the weekends), Mr. McGrath instead ""upgraded"" and turned a remarkable place into just another old town restaurant.

Don't me wrong, the Roaring Fork is genius... but this place was as well....",2
Restaurants,"The new ""Pischke's Blue Ribbion"" is a cleaner, updated, reinvented ""Pischke's""... and it really blows! It is overpriced and boring!

There is NO POINT in keeping the ""Pischke's"" name on this place whatsoever! I know tragedy struck this place once, and now it has again, with the complete disembowelment of what ""Pischke's"" was all about! 

It was a Scottsdale ledgend, it was a chill place to grab breakfast and work on the ol' hangover, it was actually perfect the way it was...

Too bad.",2
Restaurants,"Admittedly, two of these stars are for the $1 dollar mimosas that we drank several carafes of.  I mean pretty much the deal of the century- $1 Mimosas, PBR and Bloody's...not only for brunch, but also apparently on Sunday nights. The food was solid, but not amazing- we sampled the the burgers (yum) and the buttermilk fried chicken caesar- (pretty tasty). The fries here are also quite delicious- thin, crisp and just the right amount of salt. Service was not only prompt and friendly, but it was damn good lookin :) I think this spot is definitely underrated and worth checking out for a lazy Saturday brunch.",4
Restaurants,"Robert McGrath is an amazing chef.  That really is all that needs to be said when it comes to Pischke's.  If have have never been here before it is absolutely worth the trip.  You won't bump into a lot of tourists because the atmosphere is very laid back.  However, the food is wonderful.

We were huge fans of Roaring Fork (before Robert sold it) and we even had McGrath cater the rehersal dinner for our wedding.  

The green chili pork stew is by far one of the best items on the menu and it can be ordered to share with the table, or it is enough for a whole meal.

One of our favorite, casual, places in Old Town.",4
Restaurants,"Dear Mr. McGrath,

I recognize you are a talented award winning chef. I love the Roaring Fork. However, I am wholehaeartedly dissapointed in what you've done to Pischke's - its just not Pischke's anymore at all. Pischke's was a fun, friendly, unpretentious, comfort food joint. I loved hitting Pischke's for lunch after a NASTY hangover. The single BEST SALAD ON THE PLANET was the Blackened Cajun Ceaser Salad and now its gone. Old Pischke's would've gotten * * * * * five stars.

Now it's snobby and overpriced.

BOTTOM LINE: Bring back my salad or else!!",1
Restaurants,"If it were not for the bloody mary and mimosa specials....there would be no reason to step foot in the new Pischkes (and still, I would rather go pay $7 for a mimosa where there is some atmosphere and good food. 

What a shame, this used to serve the best breakfast in town and have an hour wait....people enjoyed having a cocktail at the bar and running into friends....now, it is pretty much seat yourself and enjoy a limited menu.  HINT:  Mr. McGrath, bring back the old menu and food....I love the Roaring Fork and eat there twice a month, but this place used to be the best breakfast joint in town....bring back the old Pischke's please!!!!",1
Restaurants,"Needs a new name - now.  

The Pischke's of old had such a sad ending.  I appreciated McGrath's effort to keep ""Pischke's"" alive.  But it is nothing, nothing, nothing like the Pischke's of old.  Call it ""The Blue Ribbon Cafe"" - take out the PIschke name - I can't imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.  

The current restaurant is not a laid back, family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious, and the food matches that.",1

Public Services & Government,"Let me just start by saying that my rating is based on my heartfelt opinion that APS is a Legal monopoly, just like most power providers in the United states. I believe that monopolies, particularly for services that are required for health and safety (which they are in a state that gets as hot as AZ) are despicable. 

When I confronted APS with their monopoly status in the north valley shortly after signing up for service with them after several years with SRP further south in the valley I was politely told that they are NOT a monopoly.  I asked how she could possibly say that they weren't a monopoly when they were the only power option available in the north valley.  She replied that APS was not preventing me from paying SRP or any other company sums in the millions of dollars to run a separate power line up to my house and provide me with power.  Humm... nope, if it's not accessible to the masses (who don't have millions of dollars), then I still declare them a monopoly.

That being said, I have actually gotten nothing but good service, which I quite frankly expect, considering they have always charged 50% more than SRP, and have raised their rates 6% -40% a year since I started service in 2003.  APS provides lots of useful charts and graphs on their website to help you figure out how much energy you're using and where you can best save money.  They also offer several plans to accommodate the best pricing per your usage.  But all the cool tools in the world don't make up for the fact that they know they have you over a barrel, because you don't really have any other options for power unless you sell your family home and move to SRP territory.

I'm on the equalizer with APS, wherein they charge you a flat rate year round so that you won't have low bills in winter and high in summer.  I couldn't afford my summer bills if I weren't on this plan.  I've managed to stay afloat the last several years by consistently improving my home, replacing single pane windows with dual pane, my Homeowners Insurance replaced my AC and Roof after a hail storm, etc. which have improved the efficiency of my home to a point where APS's rate hikes have not changed how much I owe for the past 2 years.  At some point it occurred to me that my car payment was cheaper than my power bill... and it shouldn't be like that.

In this month's power bill I get a notice of their intent to raise rates by another 6.6% this year.  I'm a bit offended, but there's not a damn thing I can do. Sure, they invite you to a hearing, but they expect you to provide proof... of what exactly?  That they're overcharging customers and reporting a 70% increase in profits while submitting a request for a rate increase for a start. 

I'm sure some people will flog me for saying this, but at this point I just wish power was city run.  At least then I'd feel like I was being raped for the benefit of my local government and not to line the pockets of some skeeze-ball company... seems to work for water, sewer, and trash, why not add electric?",2
Public Services & Government,"I just moved to Phoenix from Chicago and I've also lived in Lexington Ky this is the first time I've seen so many superfluous charges on my electric bill.  If you subtract the $28 to install (when power was already on btw) my fees add up to $50 and my actual electric usage was $30 for the month of december.  I've never seen a delivery charge for electric in my life (gas yes, but that makes sense).  This delivery charge was divided into 2 segments one being $17 and the other $6.  I hope someone can tell me that SRP doesn't have this kind of fees as we are most likely moving to Mesa.",1
Public Services & Government,"APS sucks. Just moved to Phoenix from Mesa where I had SRP.  I can't believe all of the crazy fees APS tacks on. They are way more expensive than SRP. They spend 1 million per year for weatherization programs. That's our money they're using. I would rather my money stay in my pocket than pay for all of their ridiculous programs, advertising, and events. JERKS! Cut back APS, and save us some money.",1
Public Services & Government,"Okay so I assumed that if there's only 2 electric companies in a city and you don't have a choice which one you get with your residence, there wouldn't be much of a difference in service. Well. I guess I'm a fool.

I've been with SRP since I moved out on my own and I didn't love it because I was paying for a necessity but whatever. Responsibilities as an adult, right? Then I move to this place that happened to be in a small pocket in Tempe controlled by APS and BAM my electric bill went from $30/mo to $75. Well that's strange, maybe it's just some startup fees/deposit and I guess I accidentally left the heater on all day a few times. Oh, just kidding, I have SIXTY DOLLARS OF FEES. My actual electricity usage? $15. This is absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure my neighbors think they're living next to a psycho now, because you should've heard the tantrum I threw (assumption could also be due to me being alone most of the day, talking and singing to myself rather loudly, but lets disregard that fact).

Sweet, fee-less SRP, I can't believe I took you for granted. If I could, I would break my lease over this just to move back to you. Now I know why you're supposed to ask what electric company is used before you move into a place. (Very expensive) lesson learned. Once I'm out of here, APS is never going to see a penny from me again. Doesn't matter that my actual electricity service is fine (the 1 star), but the fees are just plain unfair and bad business practice. I can't believe they're still around.",1
Public Services & Government,"I actually want to rate 0, but apparently I cant. I have never been so utterly disgusted with a company until I was forced to deal with APS. Isnt it funny that there is NOTHING ANYONE can do about it?! Actually its not funny at all, its scary and wrong and unjustified. They have a monopoly on the power supply and they know it. They can do WHATEVER THEY WANT and there is nothing ANYONE can do about it.  (Unless of course you go off the grid completely, which isnt very practical for most people) I would love to lead an APS protest.",1
Public Services & Government,"APS is a very bad company.  The default, tiered usage plan will have inexperienced consumers spending 6 times the normal price, per kWh.  They use a 3rd party CC billing company because they're too cheap to process CC cards - kind of sucks if you're forced to pay with an international CC that won't work for online payments due to the fact that the billing address is foreign and doesn't have a zip code because their offices won't accept CC payment in person.  I own a house in Las Vegas and have NEVER had any of the issues that I have had with this horrible company that I am forced to use. I will be terminating my lease upon it's expiration and the primary feature for my new rental will be that the house is in an SRP area.  APS is a very bad company and I will be happy to never deal with them again.",1

It's been since January 2013 that we moved out and we have still NOT received our deposit back!!! And it's already end of March!!! Every time you call, the story is different with each representative. ""Oh, it went out yesterday!"" ""Oh, it actually takes 3 weeks to be released..."" ""Oh, ...."" Avoid making a deposit at all cost! They charge through roof and I am almost suspicious their meter numbers are reported wrong because one month that we lived there and we were on vacation for most of the month, turned eveything off and didn't use heat or A/C, the bill was still high as if we used electricity every day... Nothing makes sense with them.

This company is horrible.",1
Public Services & Government,"This is a no star company, once a monopoly but no more, now you have solar as an alternative at least for the moment.

Tell APS's Prosper and 60 plus campaigns to go back to the dark hole they climbed out of and shine some light on their true source of their monetary backers. APS will go the way of landline phone companies. They need to change with the future instead of using lobbyists to try and protect their dinosaur way of having a monopoly on electricity produced by nuclear, coal and oil. Solar is the future, inexpensive and clean.",1

Public Services & Government,"I really did not have any problem with APS until the very end when I sold my house, then APS decided to show how they really run their business.

I had signed up for the equalizer plan in 2013, and was paying just over $100 a month for my power through APS. I sold my house in August 2013, called APS and told them to turn off the power on August 30 2013, then figured I would pay my last $100 bill and all would be good. Then APS sent me a bill for $450.

I called to question the bill and was told that due to signing up for the equalizer plan, the total amount of power that I actually used that month (which was over the $100) would now be due in full ($450). I then asked what the purpose of the equalizer plan was, since obviously it doesnt save you any money if you end up owing the full amount of your bill anyways once you move. The woman told me that the purpose of the equalizer was only to ""let you know what your bill is going to be every month"".

I suppose I could have done better research here, but I am extremely unhappy with APS springing a bill on me at the last second that is more than triple the amount I signed up for when I decided to use the equalizer plan.

Bottom line, the equalizer plan makes APS money, it does not save you any money. I would not advise using this plan unless you want a larger bill than expected once you decide to move.",1

$40 delivery charge? I didn't know someone dropped off my power every day? Must of sub contracted Santa...",1
Public Services & Government,"This needs to be posted on every APS Yelp page until they consolidate al of them. 

APS is absolutely deplorable. They have a complete monopoly on Phoenix.  Consumers don't have a choice for power service provider and because APS knows this, they charge like old mob racket. I have had service with them, again, no choice, and one day I get a letter stating that I have a security deposit required. I had service at this new address for 5 months before this came to so I called. They told me because I was past the due date that they can at their discretion ask for one. EVEN AFTER SERVICE HAS BEEN CONNECTED.  I obviously have no choice in the matter. I asked them what past due meant. They told me after 13 days!!! My mortgage allows 30 days. The credit bureau reporting system is based on 30 days. The whole world works off 30 days. Past due after 15. Very crafty how the bill is due JUST before most people would pay their bills from their paycheck on the 15th. 

They charge me 1.5 times my bill for the last 12 months. Now remember, I have only been there for 5 months so rather than judge it on MY last bills which are low, I have to be averaged off of another family. So the deposit was massive. 
So I tell them (based on principal) that I cannot afford to pay it. So they say they will separate it into 2 payments (how generous). So I make the first payment of 80. Mind you, this is NOT for services rendered. 
Next month I get my bill in the mail, and like every month, I pay it.  

Few days later my power gets shut off.  I think its a building fuse or from a storm, but as I am walking to the maint office, I see the yellow tag on my meter. 

So I call APS and say WTF?? They tell me I was shut off for non payment. I quickly log on to my bank and see it was paid and I tell them this. They say, "" no, it was for security deposit"". I asked them what do I owe on my service. They said nothing. I said, so I got disconnected over an arbitrary deposit when my bill is paid in full? They said yes. 

They then tell me there is a reconnection fee and if I want it done that day there is 100 rush fee.  Now, this is all happening in the morning. I went to the gym and came home within the hour. So you know the service guy was within a mile. 

I talked to the ""manager"" and he was "" nice enough to cut me a break"" and not charge a reconnection fee. So I waited until the next day so I wouldn't have to pay the rush fee, and avoid reconnection. So because it was a cool 115 that day, I had to sleep at my gf's, WITH MY 2 KIDS!!!!

The next day all of my food was bad and still cost me over 100 for no reason.

Public Services & Government,"BAD service is so rampant nowadays it is disgusting.  I called near the end of August to have power connected on 8/29/14. Of course they requested a $250.00 deposit, even though I had had service with them before and always paid on time, but whatever (it had been a few years).
I called back on 9/2/14 to disconnect because it turned out I was not going to be moving to the location (nobody was at the location at all during this time either so there was no power consumption). I was told it would be disconnected and they confirmed the address to send my deposit back to. The associate stated 7-10 business days. After 10 business days I called back and was told they got confused and didn't realize I had actually disconnected service, they thought I was transferring it. Ummm ok. Not sure what happened to the entire conversation I had with the previous rep DISCONNECTING SERVICE AND GIVING THEM MY FORWARDING ADDRESS IN CA FOR THE REFUND. So, I was told it would now be processed and take 14-21 days. Ok. Annoying but whatever. After thinking about it, I decided to call back to see if they could bump up the timeframe since the issue was on their end. The associate assured me it would mail within 4 business days. Ok. Not sure why the timeframe keeps changing.  I wait 4 business days and call once again just to confirm the it was being sent out and was told ""yes it went out on the 23rd"" (which was indeed 4 days after my last call). Here we are, 4 more business days after the refund allegedly mailed out and still nothing. I send mail from CA to GA and it takes at MAX of 3 business days. Not sure where these refunds generate from that would take longer than 4 business days. Pretty sure it was not sent. So here I am, on hold, 51 minutes later and haven't even spoken with a live person. Pathetic. Oh, and I found out my deposit would be short $40 because of fees. I feel sorry for anyone that lives in an APS only location. I had SRP for a few years and had absolutely zero problems with them.",1
Public Services & Government,"APS is one of the biggest examples of crookery in the municipal power industry. No matter how much a person tries to reduce their power usage, the fees and taxes that APS tacks on makes it impossible. My last bill was $244, and 95.00 of that was taxes/fees. They put on fees for the most ridiculous reasons, they pass on EVERYTHING to the consumer. The worst was when they started installing the SMART meter, the kind that flashes electromagnetic waves through your house every fifteen minutes. First off, as our master bedroom is about five feet away from the meter...we started having sleep problems. Next my arm began to have a pins and needles feeling in it. My husband demanded they remove it (as they didn't bother to let us know they were changing our meter) and they did...with another SMART meter that is read by someone driving by.  By the way, APS is putting the knuckle on the commission to let them charge 30.00 a month to those who refuse the SMART meter, not to mention how they are trying to penalize those who have solar power. This is a monster of a monopoly and if we were in the days of the French Revolution they would be burned down. The CEO made $7,000,000 last year. I bet he gets a big bonus as well for screwing so many customers. This is a quote from a page glorifying him *(NAME REMOVED) is chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer for Pinnacle West Capital Corporation and Arizona Public Service Company (APS), Pinnacle West's primary subsidiary. The companies are headquartered in Phoenix. APS serves 1.2 million customers across Arizona and is among the nation's top-performing utilities for reliability and customer satisfaction.* You can bet it wasn't a customer who wrote that garbage. I am so disgusted with the ripping off of the average person to make these monopolies so wealthy. I have never had my service cut off but the first summer after the SMART meter was put on, our bill soared from 200.00 in 2012 to 459 in 2013...and we set our A/C on 83 and are careful to use on off-peak. One month (Oct 2013) we used only 47 kilowatts...but our bill was over $200 due to the ridiculous 'demand charge' 'usage fee', etc. I don't know how the bigwigs at APS can sleep at night, but I do believe that to be a CEO, you must be a sociopath as well. I couldn't sleep knowing I was essentially cheating so many people who are trying to get by.",1

Like any for profit business, they don't people to consume less of their product so they can make less profit.  Nope. They will do everything in their power  to eliminate residential solar, and make it as difficult and expensive for their customers as they can.  The only thing they know is higher profits.

The bill included more than $150 in standard, monthly fees (not including taxes).  Rot in a fire APS.",1
Public Services & Government,"APS is truly a terrible company. Not only do they pad bills with fees that often total twice your electricity rate but they don't bother performing regular upkeep on their infrastructure. In my neighborhood, the power flickers and goes out during every storm. This means they leave up old, wooden poles that constantly sway in storms and sometimes even topple over if the wind speed is just a bit too powerful. Sometimes the power outage is a mere two minutes and the worst yet was this week when my power went out for more than 24 hours. 

The best solution APS could offer, instead of reimbursements or even credits for more than a day without electricity was a bag of ice at 10AM (14 hours after the power went out) and absolutely no ETAs for electricity restoration. How is a bag of ice supposed to keep my family and my pets comfortable when the temperatures reach 106° outside? How is a bag of ice supposed to keep a stocked fridge from going bad? A freezer may be able to keep food at a relatively safe temperature for up to 48 hours but a fridge can only do so for 4 hours before the temperatures begin rising. My food already went 10 additional hours without proper cooling, which meant that any ""help"" they provided was just an attempt to save face.",1

When you get a 400$ utility bill for a two bedroom apartment there's a problem. Considering my power has been out multiple times this month. (Get your shit together dudes... You wanna rape folks for money try to keep them power lines workin') it's a magical mystery how they've managed to get away with it. I'm willing to bet they're up one or two local politicians buttholes. I would however like to compliment them on their relentless customer service fails. You will never get them to fix your bill.

When I called the representative said that it was automated and was ""up to the system"". Why don't they generate every 30 days like every normal company? More than likely so they can make more profit. The actual usage is usually only 1/4 of the bill and the other 3/4 of the bill are random fees that are tacked on. They say that it is required, which is funny because SRP never has those fees. My first bill when I moved here in 2014 was $202 dollars, which is funny because I got it 5 days after I moved into my home.",1

Yesterday, APS decided that our meter (although smart) was not transmitting properly. Maybe because we paid $30 bucks less this month and they thought it was a mistake??? so they sent a guy today to change it.

The decor is dim and soothing.  It was quiet and peaceful when we arrived, but got louder as the later reservations arrived--although it was never too loud.
My one complaint would be that there is an extremely limited number of options for vegetarians.  In fact, there is nothing on the entree menu.  However, when we asked we discovered that there is an off-menu vegetarian plate that proved to be quite delicious according to my boyfriend.  I enjoyed an amazing mesculan salad, delicious monkfish (which I've never tried before) and finished off with a petit lemon tart--yum!",4
Restaurants,"I went there last night with a few friends.  We had all heard great things and were not disappointed at all.  We arrived at the bar about 30 min. prior to reservation and had a couple glasses of wine from their extensive selection.  The wine prices are pretty reasonable considering some of the other ""wine bars"" in town.  I'd say the price is 2x to 3x cost.  I order a bottle of Cakebread Chardonnay at Sonoma Grille this weekend and the price was 5x cost.  So, with respect to the competition I guess 2x isn't bad.  The bartender was professional and I've seen her at other places.  Her name is Holly and she is attentive and welcoming.  One small issue was that the floor by the bar was sticky which was kind of weird.  The overall atmosphere is warm and inviting.  We were sat at a fine table with perfect lighting.  Our waiter was great.  I also noticed another great waiter, Raj, who used to work at Nine on Nine and Eleven.  It seems to me that the Chef/Owner took special care in his staff hiring.  The Maitre'D is also helpful and experienced.  Okay..., the food.  We started with  a nice selection of warm bread which was on par, but nothing special.  We then ordered steak tartare, belgian endive salad, and mushroom ravioli as appetizers.  The steak tartare was delicious.  It was served with a quail egg and perfectly toasted ciabatta.  The belgian endive was okay, but not memorable.  It should have had more walnuts and cheese and less endive.  The ravioli was rich and delicious served with oxtail which I thought was interesting.  The entrees' were awesome.  I had the beef short ribs which they are known for and it without a doubt the best I've ever had and one of the ""richest"" dishes I've ever had.  Another friend had the lamb which was perfect and another dish sampled was the roasted chicken.  Thomas Keller has said his favorite meal on earch is roasted chicken and I can see why after sampling Mio's.  The portions were perfect.  One of my pet peeves is huge portions and this place does not fall into the trap.  The prices are more than most, but the ingredients are stellar.  There was no room for dessert.  We finished the evening at the bar with a few more drinks and spoke with Matt who is the chef/owner.  He told us all about stories of Mario Batali and the like in NYC where he was sous chef at Veritas.  We are lucky to have a chef this talented in Pittsburgh.  Mio is my favorite NEW restaurant and deserves your visit.  They are also going to start serving lunch in April.  So, you'll be able to sample the same quality without the same pricetag as dinner.",4
Restaurants,"Preface: I live in the Bay Area now, and I don't know many Pittsburgh restaurants beyond Primanti Bros.  Further, I booked a dinner at this ""Kitchen and Wine Bar"" before I knew that my companions were not in a wine mood.  Anyways...

The good news is the service and ambiance were excellent.  All of the servers were friendly and attentive, and the decor was modern yet soothing.  They knew where I could park without feeding a meter and without getting a ticket -- try getting that info on the Embarcadero!

Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the food.  The salmon tartare was very fishy - mostly the salmon ""caviar.""  The saffron rice (sidenote: are you afraid to call it risotto because you're in Aspinwall?   (a) don't be; and (b) then call it very creamy round grained rice, apparently cooked in broth) was so salty that I actually asked myself if I had done something to offend the chef.  He couldn't have meant for it to be this salty, unless he recognizes me from 7th grade study hall or something (and if so, put away the salt shaker and come out of the kitchen --  I haven't forgotten either!)  The short ribs were soft but not as soft as they should be.

Final note: they offered me a free dessert, which was a nice enough touch that I might actually go back, in the hopes that I just caught the chef on an off night.  Hmmm.  Maybe I do forgive and forget.",2
Restaurants,"My girlfriend and I went to Mio yesterday to celebrate an anniversary. We walked in anticipating a delicious meal and walked out with our expectations met and a new restaurant on our list of favorites.

Mio's ambience is perfect: elegant and inviting, without any hint of stuffiness. The wine selection was good, and seemed fairly priced (at least by the glass). My first course of salmon tartare, which I ordered at the waitress's recommendation, was delicious, as were the braised short ribs I had for my entrée. My girlfriend felt similarly about her crab salad and pork chop. For dessert, I had a peach cobbler, while my girlfriend had a creative s'more deconstruction. Both were excellent.

Perhaps the only complaint we had was that the main course portion sizes were quite large, especially given the fact that the menu is set up so as to provide two courses. My short ribs, in particular, could have easily fed two people.

Would have been better value to take cab.....or just pay cash to shuttle that is already in front of hotel and ready to go. Waiting for 20+ minutes in Las Vegas heat, and having to track one more document(voucher) is crazy. Never again.",1
Public Services & Government,"Harassment with a smile...well not as much! Very poor customer service, not very helpful and mean when someone sets off the metal detector. I think they should have private security like they have in SFO....TSA should change their motto to ""People are not our specialty""

I had the honor of one of these fine guys stick their finger up my butt because he believed I had a bulge on the back of my pants. I was fondled also...not a good way to start my vacation!",1
Public Services & Government,"This was by far my worst TSA experience ever, and I travel very frequently. They treated passengers terribly, and didn't discriminate against anyone, they just picked on each person for one reason or another, including an 85 year old man who was embarassed and even forced to show the inside of this pants to the man with the seach wand and the power trip. I understand their job is serious, but I even watched one man throw a bag at a passenger and say 'get you big bottle out of here' only to find out that it was 2.2 oz. As passengers, we are expected to know our info, as should they. And don't talk to me like I'm stupid just because you're twice my and, and have the ever so tough ability to sit on you stool and check to make sure my ticket and ID say the same name.",1
Public Services & Government,"Traveled through LAs Vegas yesterday. I travel a lot through many different airports and this takes the cake. 
For the last six or eight months i have sailed through TSA with my liquids in a makeup bag and left in my travel bag. Everything is under three oz. and I have been able to get through without any problem. 
Not in Las Vegas. She pulled me to the side, pulled out all my bottles, and put them into a baggie I happened to have with me for something else and then sent it through the machine again and says I can go.
In case you didnt understand what happened, all she did was move my bottles from one place to another. WTH? She didnt take anything away from me ,I didnt have anything too large, she just needed a power trip that day and decided that she wanted to rearrange my items.
I dont have a problem with rules but if you are going to have rules then they should be the same at every airport. This was the most ridiculous display of our TSA at work.",1
Public Services & Government,"Thank you Las Vegas TSA!!  I had a full Xray Body Scan and Pat down October 13th 2011.  It couldn't have been a more pleasant experience and my first!  What a happy and friendly TSA group at this airport.  We had a wonderful 15 days in LV and now that we r home in Long Island (Selden, NY),  I felt that this letter of appreciation should be written.  Thank You for keeping us safe in the air TSA!!

Public Services & Government,"The service was horrible!  Almost missed our flight today because the security line was so long... it wound around and went across the terminal!  They only had 2 people checking boarding passes and 2 belts for bag checks, but only one xray scanner for all normal passengers to bottleneck through. Meanwhile they had the same amount of checkers for a separate, much shorter business and first class line and they only had to go through the metal detector.  We had to wait 45 minutes in the normal line while we watch the business and first class people go right through!",1
Public Services & Government,"The TSA people in Las Vegas need to have a refresher training week at San Jose airport where they could be taught how to be just the teeniest bit friendly.  San Jose TSA knows how to efficiently get people through and act like human beings all at the same time.  Las Vegas TSA?  Jerks.....scowling, snide remarks, hollering.  Ugh.  I know they aren't hired to be Mr. Las Vegas like Steve Wynn or something, but what the heck is the matter with them?",1
Public Services & Government,"-TSA agents at Gate B @ McCarran Airport need training on how to use their common sense skills.

-The agents weren't rude, just really more like slow moving zombies with no individual thoughts or empowerment to make a common sense decision.

-Long line, two open lanes, most agents were standing around inspecting shampoo bottles and cosmetics and running bags to be rescanned.

-Why does a CLEAR ziplock bag containing CLEAR 3 fl oz bottles with CLEAR liquids need to be x-rayed two additional times? Maybe the agents think an explosive might magically appear with each scan?

-Why did my other randomly scattered in my-suitcase-and-handbag-liquids (lotion, hand sanitizer, nail polish, lip gloss, etc) go unnoticed? 

-Isn't nail polish more flammable than a travel size stick of Degree deodorant, which by-the-way ended up being subjected to individual inspection and another trip through the scan machine?

-I don't remember reading about any Al-Quida groups terrorizing airplane passengers with travel-sized toiletries or unopened packs of moisturizer. Box cutters were used on 9/11 and explosives were used in other acts of terror, but these situations were defused (pun!) by other passengers and crew, not the TSA.

-Body Scan = Seen naked by a random TSA agent in some hidden airport room in addition to being exposed to a slight dose of radiation.

-Many of the TSA rules and policies make no sense, many which are inconsistant. 

-Currently, folks over 75 yrs old can keep on their shoes and jacket, not folks who are 73 yrs or 74 yrs old, because they could be real trouble-makers I suppose.

-As for the 3fl oz liquid rule, isn't the human body mostly composed of liquids? 

-Overall, the TSA is very inconsistant, no matter which airport or terminal you end up at

-Just show up early for your flight in case you end up being subjected to this unnecessary TSA monkey business.",1
Public Services & Government,"Flew out of McCarran this morning .... was in a hurry and forgot to grab my wallet out of a suitcase, had my ID in my pocket for easy access at the airport plus a little cash for the taxi ride. To my surprise when I got my bags back at my destination I had a little slip stating my bag had been searched. We like I mentioned before had forgot to grab my wallet, oh don't worry the wallet was there but the $500 in the money clip was gone. None of our other bags were search just that one. Last time I flew out of there my headphones came up missing. So what can they really see when they scan a bag I'm sure they are pretty familiar what items look like on the scans and funny how that bag got selected to be searched. The TSA sucks and I believe there are thief's that work in the organization. I know my fault for making the mistake. So from now on I will be like every other passenger carrying as much on board as I can that has value and leaving my clothes and deodorant to be stolen. Thats for ruining a great trip TSA.",1
Public Services & Government,"While complaining about TSA seems useless, after flying through Las Vegas, it may be cathartic. First, the TSA staff (with the exception of one woman who really tried to be helpful) is unfriendly and uncaring. Second, the TSA staff clearly needs more training. And finally, can someone with even a modicum of expertise in efficiency design consult with the TSA at Las Vegas so that its absurd system can be redesigned?

Let's start with the staff. They seemed to pride themselves on not being helpful. We were in line behind a woman who arrived late for her flight home to Hong Kong (via San Francisco). Her English was limited and she was panicked about not making her connecting flight. Not one TSA person would even attempt to listen to her, let alone help. She showed us her ticket, which showed that her flight had already started to board and that it would depart in about 20 minutes. I pointed this out to the TSA official. Her reply, ""She has to wait in line until her turn, It's her problem if she was late."" She then turned and walked away. In other airports, I have seen TSA help people in that situation. I guess not only what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but when you arrive late to the airport, you also stay in Vegas.

Now to the staff. Our screening line moved excruciatingly slowly. In fact, it didn't moved for long stretches. Why? The screener had no idea what he was looking at. He must have routed one of every six bags for further screening. My bag was targeted. Why? They had to separately my battery backup. In the process they lost the strap to my bag, but merely walked away. That was in addition to me standing holding my laptop and being told by another screener to move while he examined another passenger's bag. How I was to reload my bag when it eventually passed its second screening - and after his cohort instructed me not to go anywhere -- was irrelevant. 

And lastly, to efficiency. Like every TSA line, it's setup like Disney World, with long lines twisting. But then as we got closer to the initial screener, the line was divided into two lines. We all thought ""Great,"" we'll move a bit more quickly. Silly us. All it did was divide the line until we all alternated before the lone screener. Then, once we survived that stupidity, we were left to meander into the lines where we and our belonging were checked. There certainly weren't enough lines open, and when you added in the wait caused by our zealous screener, I have no doubt that others also missed their flights.

While we made our flight, with time to spare, it seems ironic that a city that's entire existence is based on tourism would allow a situation to fester in which tourists final memory was a lasting sneer from TSA.",1
Public Services & Government,"first the TSA little Mattel wearing badges were being very rude to general public trying to yell at people and after they passed were laughing at people making fun of them as I approached the scanner I suddenly remembered I had forgot my belt and the lady yelled and said to put it in a bowl stepped out of the scanner and handed it to my wife, then she said how many people does it take to handle a belt, I lost it and looked at her and said You need to calm down lady Now , she backed up and didn't say another word. Start Standing up to these pricks ! By the way they are Not Police but just a bunch of want to be cops, No Authority  at all. They throw something at you You throw it back",1
Public Services & Government,"Worst TSA experience ever.  Just because you are charged with safety does not give you the right to be verbally abusive to your charges.  I was treated like an idiot and yelled at by the staff throughout the screening process.  They should be ashamed of themselves for their horrid behavior towards their fellow man.   The same job could be accomplished with understanding and courtesy.  I am embarassed for them.  Also, let me post this quote of the 4th Amendment:  

""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.""

This search was unreasonable as were their manners.",1
Public Services & Government,"I live in Henderson and travel almost weekly.  TSA is pretty much hit or miss... but mostly miss... so good luck with that.

My problem is the TSA Pre-Check.

Since I live in the area the tram at Gate C is easier to use since I usually do not check bags.  However, they do NOT offer TSA Precheck altho they do in the D gates just alongside the C gate line.

They did start for a while, but quickly stopped.   The last time I went through the D gates to be 'let inside' the C gates by a TSA agent.  No one showed up.   Two TSA agents were coming in so tried to exit as they entered.  Was LOUDLY encountered with a WHERE ARE YOU GOING!?  and even when said C-gate Precheck was condescended to and made to show the boarding pass.   Next time they didn't even allow C gate passengers to enter.

So now go to the main C-Gate (Southwest) security area.  I show my boarding pass and am pointed to a special line that wraps along the wall to ONE TSA agent at a TSA PREcheck booth.  Usually 10 or 12 people deep.   

Which would be no problem EXCEPT there are TWO OTHER agents at a stand BOTH with TSA PreCheck signs that the 'general public' can get in line for and then go through Pre-Check themselves.  And NO, the 'main' TSA PreCheck line does NOT have access to the other two stations.",1
Public Services & Government,"Worst TSA experience, ever. 

As a sexual human being, with adult content in one's bag, going through the screening process part in Las Vegas... I thought this would be a breeze! I had no trouble going through SeaTac's security, whatsoever. 

My wife was directly in front of me and our bags just happened to be going through the screen much faster, with very little congestion. Soooo, MY bag happened to be seen as her bag. 
Basic lowdown: We are a married, lesbian couple and my wife is the seemingly Alpha one. We aren't used to men getting up in our business, but it occasionally happens - life. So, with little surprise, this husky, mid-30s TSA gentleman comments quietly and condescendingly to her about how funny it is that our relationship needs this extra implementation, laughs, then returns to his station. Rude! 

It wasn't even her bag and we're in Vegas!!

When I presented my ID and social security card and credit card to the tsa during my CONNECTING flight they had a whole security show down. My bags were searched and I was fully patted down. I respect the safety the tsa provides but I definitely felt as though they misused their authority. I felt very uncomfortable and it made their tsa seem inconsistent. Not impressed.,1
Public Services & Government,"I've had nothing but positive experiences with LAS and TSA staff here- if anything, the lines for security are efficient and more often than not, they expedite the process by moving people to the TSA Precheck line.

Public Services & Government,"No lines and a beautiful airport. That gets 2 stars. Tonight a female TSA agent at D gates/TSA pre-check was downright rude. I politely asked for a bin for my phone and watch. She smirked, shook her head, and snapped ""there are no bins in pre-check!"" She said it like I was a complete idiot. No reason to be rude. I know what I'm doing. Shame on TSA for being rude. It's not necessary.",2
Public Services & Government,"This is a big deal. While checking a bag that contained a firearm, the agents demonstrated a complete and utter lack of knowledge of the laws they're supposed to be there to enforce. They REQUIRED me to provide them with the key to my locked gun case, so they could open it OUTSIDE MY PRESENCE. This is a HUGE no-no, and I was completely blown away that they demanded it. I refused, naturally, as that would have been a violation of federal law. Eventually had to call my son and have him pick up the firearm, and was forced to be without it for the duration of my trip. Bottom line: The agents need MUCH better training, and they could stand to lose the attitude, too. The arrogance might be justified if they knew the laws they're enforcing at least as well as the passengers, but they clearly didn't, and the know-it-all attitude and arrogance they demonstrated while demanding that I break the law is inexcusable.",1

Guess that's why she insisted that I don't touch the bag.",1
Public Services & Government,"I lost my ID the day before my flight, and I thought I was screwed.

After I was checked, I walked all the way to my gate, only to be chased down by the same agent who frisked me... Apparently, I had left my boarding pass at the TSA checkpoint and he was kind enough to run it to me!

WTF, find another job if you dont like dealing with the public or if you cant find another job be happy and thankful that you have a job at all.

From the time you self-surrender to the time you actually get to the tents is about 18-20 hours. With in that time you'll be bounced around from cell to cell. Now these cell are nothing pleasant. There is one stainless steel toilet with a water fountain for drinking on top of the tank of the toilet. The occupancy of these cells I would estimate to be 15-20 people, while they cramp 40-45 people in them. You literally have to stand or lay on another individuals limbs. No joke, I witnessed a few individuals standing for a period of more than 10 hours, just for the simple fact that there was no room to do anything but. So image bouncing to  several cells like this until you finally reach the tent where you obtain your bunk. 

The Detention Officers here are very hit or miss, some are extremely professional and you can tell they follow the policy by the book. These D.O.s are not that bad at all. Some have a very awesome sense of humor that keeps things interesting. These D.O.s are my favorite, and you can tell they absolutely love their duty! Now... There are D.O.s that are the exact opposite. These individual give off a bad character flaw, and a strong indication that they are either not happy with the D.O. duty, or have a hard time grasping the fact that life is short and you have to get in where you fit in and be happy you're given the opportunity to get in, in the first place. These individuals are the ones that Sheriff Joe needs to keep a heavy eye on. I wouldn't trust these certain D.O.s to follow policies at all. I noticed I lot of discrimination from these D.O.s Even more so seeing and witnessing corners being cut so they can get ""off the clock"" a lot sooner. 

Once I finally reached the Tents, I was relived to finally rest my head on my bunk. I kid you not, I probably slept for about 9 hours once I first got to my bunk. I am glad I brought cash with me for the commissary. In the commissary thee are several vending machines where you get a nice selection of bottled beverages, and food. I did not eat or drink anything unless I got it from the commissary. They only down fall with the commissary is that the D.O.s will take it away by locking it up, if they so choose to. I had the opportunity to witness this happen when the D.O.s found an inmate smoking cigarettes. I was cracking up one time when one of the Sargent D.O.s was ranting and raving on the intercom about how he smells ciggerette smoke and if he find the person he'd take commissary away for the rest of the day. Well, the smoke he was smelling was one of his own D.O.s smoking right outside the office.Talking about jokes on you.. hahaha

Once you start checking out to leave for the last day of your sentence you have to go through the same checking in process except this process doesn't take 18-20 hours. It's more like 5 hours. They yanked me from my bunk at 11:15pm and I was free walking the streets by 4:30am.

All in all this place definitely serves its purpose. Makes you think about the decisions you made in the past and reevaluate your life and it's priorities. Long story short.... you will not be seeing me coming back here. EVER!!!",3
Public Services & Government,"Great value.  It has a rustic Korean War ambiance with a hint of modern.  Continental breakfast was late the first few weeks and the staff is not very customer service oriented. The security is very good at making sure no one breaks in. Checking out is typical, if you have ever stayed at a free time share.  The layout really encourages people to make new friends.  The flooring is soft like sand and the eco friendly ventilation mimics the outdoor environment perfectly.  My only recommendation would be a better valet service.

Public Services & Government,"The Mills Avenue District is located between 3rd Street and Mill Avenue - 5 blocks from the Arizona State University campus.

Outdoor seating is available at most restaurants to take advantage of the wonderful Arizona springtime weather. Boutique clothing stores cater to the university crowd. The police make their presence known by patrolling the area on bike or on horseback.",5
Public Services & Government,"Best Feature: Ambiance

I'm gonna have to be brutally honest with you, Mill Avenue is not the coolest place in Tempe.  In the old days, Mill was more of a bohemian paradise, with hippie street performers, people walking in the street and a cookie shop that opened it's doors and wafted the smell of cookies through the air.

Today, the Mill Avenue District (Isn't ""District"" a bit lofty of a word to describe a two mile strip on one street?) has been more commercialized.  Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing - look at 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, that's commercial and fun.  But Mill is home to several bars, 3 clothing stores and a mixture of expensive and inexpensive restaurants.  If they had truly thought out their expansion, they would have branched out a while ago and made an ""arts district"" a ""shopping district"" etc.  As it its now, they have no idea what it's supposed to be, but they slapped the ""Mill Avenue District"" name on it to give people the feeling they're living in a real city.

Mill's real problem now is that the buildings are too expensive for anyone not representing a giant company to afford.  Even if they somehow afford one, the rent and the lack of people buying things usually drives them in the ground (Swell Clothing RIP).

However, Mill is not without it's merits.  If you ARE looking for a place to get drunk, it's very convenient, especially for ASU students.  Slices is a great no nonsense pizza by the slice joint.  Occasionally, there are events like the Arts Festival, which end up being fun.

Overall, Mill is better than nothing, but it's got a long way to go.",3
Public Services & Government,"The Mill Avenue District is the ONLY place in Arizona where you can actually walk from place to place.  You can park your car and spend all day there!  It is also the only downtown area that is waterfront, so you can relax while walking along Tempe Town Lake, or even rent a paddle boat from Rio Lago.

There a several great restaurants in the Mill Avenue District, such as Caffe Boa, House of Tricks, and La Bocca Urban Pizzeria & Wine Bar.  There are also several major events that are definetly worth going to, like the twice annual Tempe Festival of the Arts!  

Downtown Tempe encompasses the Mill Avenue District (Mill Ave), the Lake District (Tempe Beach Park), University District (College Ave), and the Farmer Arts District (Ash Ave).  There is LOTS to do.",4
Public Services & Government,"I visited Mill Avenue yesterday afternoon after a long period of avoiding it, mostly because of the parking situation and the aggressive panhandlers. It's been a while, I thought, and many of the corporate chains that ruined the street are fleeing as fast as their trucks can carry them off. It's worth a shot. 

I attempted to park in front of the now-vacant Z-Gallerie, only to find that meters had been installed. Of course, nobody carries change nowadays, so I followed the blue sign that read ""Public Parking"" and wound up in the virtually empty parking garage. I spent less than an hour on the street, and when I was leaving the business I'd come to visit, I asked about having my parking pass validated. ""We don't do that any more,"" I was told. ""They took our equipment. Anyway, the first hour's free."" Back at the parking garage, I was surprised when the attendant in the booth, without a word of greeting, said flatly, ""Two dollar."" ""Two dollars?"" I asked him, explaining that the first hour was free, at least according to a business owner on the street. ""Two dollar,"" he said again. I had no cash, and told him so. ""Two dollar. Two dollar,"" said the parrot in his little cage. I asked him where I could get cash on the street and he said, exasperated, ""Is two dollar!""

I backed up (unsurprisingly there was nobody behind me), parked, and, already running late for an appointment, walked to the kiosk at Bank of America, was asked for spare change by a kid lounging on the sidewalk, crossed the street, re-entered the parking garage, drove up to the booth, and again presented my parking pass to the attendant, who now said, without irony, ""Three dollar."" Evidently it cost another dollar to walk across the street to pay the already extortionate sum of two dollars. Wordlessly I handed him a twenty and, ignoring the faint smile on his lips, left Mill Avenue, this time for good. 

The last time I visited Mill (more than a year ago), I received a $40 parking ticket after having lingered too long in Borders -- another business that I see has pulled up stakes and fled for a more profitable street. At the time, though, Mill Avenue was bustling. People wanted to be there. Yesterday the street was virtually abandoned, the storefronts mostly empty, the few people I encountered seemingly killing time between classes at ASU. In short, it was devoid of life. And for this they charge to park? For this they make things as difficult as possible, both for visitors and for the businesses nobody wants to visit anymore? And why would they, when they can visit the same chain stores selling the same items in any mall in America? But as usual, it's the independent businesses who suffer -- the ones who were forced out during the first wave of Mill Avenue's corporate takeover, and the ones there now, who are fighting for their lives.

What they've done to this once-charming street is a travesty.",1

Kind of a bro-fest on the weekends, Mill Ave. is tolerable and sometimes very nice during the afternoons. It's pleasant to go down and get a cup of coffee, walk around. With the loss of Border's Books I don't go down there that often, but will take the Orbit Bus to get a cuppa with a friend or something. 

I just wish there was more room for smaller, more interesting businesses. The cluster of bars and expensive clothing stores are underwhelming.  The trees, though, and the older buildings are charming. All in all, I hope Mill shapes up to be a place where everyone can go and enjoy themselves. It's time to bring back a balance and draw all different types back in.",3
Public Services & Government,"I'm 30.  That makes me at least five years too old to be on Mill Avenue to bar hop on a Saturday night (unless you're a transient).  Although I have to admit that I enjoy stopping by every few months for the nostalgic value.  It brings me back to my college days at ASU even though most of the places I frequented back then are gone.

Mill is a great place to go get something to eat.  Maybe even hit up a bar or two after a football or basketball game.  But if you're no longer of college age.  You may want to avoid it at all costs.",2
Public Services & Government,"I absolutely HATE that I can say this... but, I remember the days when Mill Avenue had a different feel to it. There used to be fewer chains and the vibe was much more bohemian, making it more or less the only part of the Valley with any personality. Several years later, visitors to Mill Avenue really just go to a simulacrum; a soulless husk of an Old West-ish main drag. Don't be fooled by the ""historical buildings"" on the street, as a number of them are over a century old, but quite a few were built architecturally designed to look old. I can appreciate the aesthetic value of it, just as I can appreciate the attempt to make a walkable neighborhood. Unfortunately, only this synecdoche of Tempe is walkable: the majority of visitors have to drive to get here (not good for a bar-hopping/drinking-and-driving destination) and the lack of amenities would still make it difficult to live and work here without a car, unless they shop for groceries at the corner CVS. Its proximity to ASU is likely to keep it a popular destination, as is Downtown Phoenix' laziness and willingness to let Tempe take prominent events (i.e. Oktoberfest, New Year's Eve,) but all in all it's worth avoiding.",1
Public Services & Government,"You're getting old. Your college days are over, and you have a crippling fear of ""douchebags"" or lightly dressed women who remind you how much weight you've gained since graduation. You tiptoe through the mainstay restaurants like Rula Bula while avoiding Sun Devils at every cost. Then you post unflattering reviews on Yelp while secretly knowing you've enjoyed every trip.

Mill Ave falls somewhere in between posh outdoor strip mall that tickles every fancy to unnavigable, clogged road, full of drunkards and the cops who babysit them. Either way, I'll be having a blast. Think to yourself: Where else in this town could you stumble out of the bar at 2AM, find yourself in a hookah bar until 4AM, then grab some cheap eats and chat until 6AM, when the booze starts flowing again. It's a cycle that can last as long as your wallet or organs do.

Seriously though, there's no place I'd rather be taking a stroll in the middle of the night. Paired with all the epic times I've had here with or without getting hammered, I'm afraid this is as good as it gets in these parts.",5
Public Services & Government,"I enjoy going to Mill Ave. Whether it's for the nightlife or going to the different restaurants, there is always something to do to suit your different tastes. 

Mill Ave. is a place anyone should try especially on lazy days when you don't know what to do. It's a good place to hang out with your friends!",4
Public Services & Government,"I am reviewing Mill Ave as a whole, this is different than the individual businesses on the Ave.
Mill Ave seems like a fun place to hang out when you get bored, and it is, mostly.
I really don't like the police force out there (are any of them good in the Valley?), they are way too in your business which they should be for disruptive or drunk people, but not really for those of us who are clearly not doing anything wrong. If I am sitting on a bench on Mill Avenue that does not imply that I am also a drunk underage drug dealer as well.
However there are many disruptive people on Mill Avenue, and it seems that the cops are less worried with those who are actually committing crimes. I mean I am a firm believer in the saying ""two each his own"", do what you gotta do to be happy. I am not easily bothered but when I walk down a street and see a man peeing in the open, a man vomiting in a bush, a group of guys in speedos, and a group of girls in lacy bras within five minutes, I am a bit irritated. Especially because more than a few cops passed by and my friends and I are the only ones who look suspicious.
There are also the countless creepers you can find on Mill Ave. I am not talking about the homeless, they are actually quite easy to get along with around there. I am referring to the guys that basically harass everyone of the female gender that walks by.
I mean I suppose I should know what I'm getting myself into by heading over to a place such as Mill Avenue, but it's a bit ridiculous.",2
Public Services & Government,"Downtown Tempe now has free metered parking after 6 PM on weekdays. It gets crowded, but some spaces are usually available near the Tempe Beach Park end of Mill.",4
Public Services & Government,"Mill Ave and I have had some fun... back when it was two lanes and there was a cop sitting around recording license plate numbers to issue tickets for ""cruising""... It used to be busy. FUN busy, not homeless busy. Every storefront was occupied, and there were some awesome independent shops. These days it has a different feel, shops are empty and stores are opening and closing within a few months. Nobody cruises Mill anymore, there are even times I almost try to avoid it because I just don't want to be asked for money again... but I'm biding my time... waiting for the day I can update this with five stars. I know it's coming... I know it is, let's just hope I don't pull a Harold Camping here.",3
Public Services & Government,"Mill is a unique area and a great part of Tempe.  It has its own character, love it or hate it.  Some business plans thrive here, and some that seem like sure things fizzle and disappear.  Lots of good bars and shops.
Go here during the day to grab lunch or do your banking, or go for the nightlife, with Thursday through Saturday nights being the best.",5
Public Services & Government,"For those looking for a rowdy night on the town in a college setting, a very diverse crowd or you simply want to cheer on the Sun Devils, this is your spot. Mill is lively, it's got a lot going on, the streets are lined with restaurants, bars and shops and your bound to leave Mill with a story. But, if you aren't ready for a Vegas-style night in a very young (early 20's) setting, this might not be your spot. 

Like Emma W said, I am also reviewing Mill as a whole. I have been to several places on Mill that I like and several that I dislike. For those reasons, I am giving it a solid three stars. 

I like restaurants such as Canteen, Cafe Boa, Gordon Beirsch, Rula Bula, La Bocca and a couple others. I'm not a fan of any of the bars on Mill but was and would be if I was still in college or in that mind set. If I was going to visit a bar on Mill, I would go to the Big Bang piano bar for some live piano music, but be warned that it gets really crowded. I like that Tempe Town Lake is near the Mill District and they host lively concerts, block parties and races. They also have sail boating and paddle boating. And finally, I like that Mill Ave has a lively vibe where I know that no matter when I visit Mill, it was always have a group of interesting visitors. 

I don't like how dirty, crowded, rowdy and out of control Mill can get on any college game day or at night. I try to avoid Mill at night at all costs because like I mentioned above, I'm not college age anymore. If you go to Mill, I suggest you go during the day or if you go at night, be prepared.",3
Public Services & Government,"I have to give Mille Avenue a positive up for the mere fact that they might be the only district in the Valley that have adopted parking meters with an option to pay by credit card! It's great. I can't count the number of times that I need to park in a meter but lack the change needed. However, with these meters, all I had to do was swipe my card and poof! I was able to put time on the meter.",3
Public Services & Government,"I did not stop at any of the bars or restaurants along this corridor, I just drove on Mill Ave to see what was out here. It was busy on a Saturday night/early Sunday morning. 
It is worth visiting, if you are seeking something to do after the Star sets!",4
Public Services & Government,"Yuck.
(And I'm not one of the people comparing it to how it was in the 70s either - I am a 21 year old college student that thinks it is yuck.)

Mill Avenue is not the hype people give it. It is disgusting. It's dirty and grimy (and not just because it's old). There are homeless drug addicts everywhere you turn, that will harrass you if you don't give them change, and scare the crap out of me when I have to walk past. I will NOT walk down Mill after dark alone. 

Full of wasted college kids here every weekend night of course, and it is a terrible atmosphere if you're not 21-24 looking to get hammered and lucky.

Good luck finding parking, it's all metered, expensive garages, or free 3 blocks away at Farmer and 5th, but that's usually full of students' cars.

EDIT: No more free parking, ANYWHERE! 5th and Farmer is now ""Permit Only"" until 6 pm. So if you want to get lunch or hit happy hour, you are SOL on parking. Gee, Mill Avenue, guess you really must not be doing well, that you have to take more and more free parking away every few months.

The stores are all corporate garbage, except for Old Town Books, Hippie Gypsy and a couple independent (at least I think) restaurants/bars. How exactly is a giant PF Changs, Urban Outfitters, and Starbucks conducive to ""local flavor""? The rent in the area is outrageous, hence why the mom-and-pops can't stay in business.

And if I didn't hate Mill Avenue enough, the fact that they had a cute mom-and-pop ice cream sandwich store (Cookiez) and then allowed ""Slickables"", a big honking backed-by-tons-of-money store selling the EXACT SAME PRODUCT with Dreyers ice cream to move in across the street. That was just in poor taste, especially since Cookiez is now out of business.

Take your venture to Old Town Scottsdale instead - way more variety!",1
Public Services & Government,"I am just going to hit on the new ""Mill Avenue's New Year's Eve"" since most of the year, Mill Ave is exactly what you would expect so you should know if this is the kind of atmosphere you want to visit or not. 

Because the Fiesta Bowl didn't find hosting the NYE block party as profitable, Tempe was left to execute the event alone starting 12/31/12. Previously, Mill was barricaded off, you had to pay to enter, and the block party included a variety of stages and outdoor vendors you could visit while mulling around the crowds or visiting the Mill Ave shops/bars. At the north end of the party was a stage that generally included a well known music performance. 

Now that Tempe has taken over, the only significant difference between NYE and any other night on Mill is the crowded sidewalks. Now, while I have a hard time faulting a non-profit for backing away from a losing venture, in the case of the Fiesta Bowl, an organization that has proven to be a private circle jerk for Arizona's most-connected individuals, where their organization benefits heavily from public support well beyond their NP status, they seem to only find losing ventures as those which do not provide the most value to the Fiesta Bowl members personally. The city of Tempe's 2012/2013 event was enough to make sure I don't return next year. 

Honestly, I don't even give one star reviews but there is nothing to savor about the event as a whole. It's free and you get exactly what you pay for -- crowds of people crammed onto the sidewalks so pedestrians can't move and traffic can't make it through the crowds that saturate the crosswalks. There is no organization so each bar is doing it's own thing (except more crowded/expensive than usual), and all the while, the only ""entertainment"" is the same burnouts who always sit on Mill with their drum music trying to engage pedestrians for money.  

But should you still decide to go next year -- because the city's PR department will tell us that they've made it better than ever -- don't say I didn't warn you.",1
Public Services & Government,"I am just graduated from ASU and I have avoided mill avenue like the plague, unless it was at night. Why would I pay ALOT of money, just to park where my car isn't even watched, just to get hassled by homeless and begged for spare change by drug addicts. I feel like Im in an episode of walking dead when I am on this street. Not only are there homeless and pieces of trash lingering and begging, there is literally trash everywhere and everything is dirty. If you are a guy, the only store for you is urban outfitters so the shopping also sucks.  I have no problem making the drive to scottsdale where you don't pay to park, theres no homeless, and the only drugs users than affect you are the roid monkies.",1
Public Services & Government,"Mill Avenue District is the place to be and be seen in Tempe.  The corollary is that it is a good place for people watching . . .  if you like seeing drunk college students.  Yeah, it's Tempe, and it's a college town.  Shopping, dinning, drinking, strolling, and froyo, Mill District has it all in spades.  The new family fav is Canteen.  The fam has also been known to stop in for pizza at Mellow Mushroom and La Bocca.  We've tried the foyo and bought some shoes.  The side walks are wide, the traffic slow, the decorations come out during the holidays, and the parking isn't bad if you know where to look.  Mill has a character and charm all of it own.  And who knows, it might even have a light rail station one day.",5
Public Services & Government,"Mill Ave is alright. If I were a decade younger, I'm sure I would love it. I don't get to see the college-age nightlife very often now, so it's a little entertaining to watch all the stumbling around, shouting, laughter and vomiting into bushes (okay, that part isn't so entertaining). There are a few bars, restaurants and shops that I enjoy on Mill, but it's not a place I visit regularly.",3
Public Services & Government,"This has to be the best entertainment area in Arizona. Lots of bars, restaurants and shops. There seems to be more offerings for anyone under 40, if not under younger. Fun day or night, but wY different late night. Parking is easy.",5
Public Services & Government,"We came to Mill Ave in search of cigar and eats and in that it didn't disappoint. We came down around lunchtime in the middle of the week, so I didn't really notice a lot of the stuff people were complaining about (i.e. homeless). There was a ton of construction going on but there was a good amount of parking. We paid, but as we were walking noted that there was a bunch of free ones around everywhere.",3
Public Services & Government,"Our experience with Mill Ave was a bite to eat and a stop at a store, so it was pretty limited.  We went during the week, mid day and saw nothing but busy students and professional people getting breakfast and running errands.  It seemed like a nice enough area with lots of eating options and shops. There are lots of meters to park, but also look on the side streets, there were open free spots everywhere.",3
Public Services & Government,Great place to hang out on Thursday nights and Saturdays. I come here with my friends when we want a change of scene from old town. The bars are cool and id check out gringo star and el hefe. Mill is fun just be careful on the streets alone. Also la boca is great along with z Tejas and ra.,4
Public Services & Government,"Tempe has really developed the area, especially the last few years.  Depending on the time of the day, there is something to do for all age groups.  It is a stones throw to Tempe Beach park, parking is plentiful, and there is a nice variety of food with few chain restaurants.  At night, the bar scene is hopping full of ASU kids, keeping the vibe electric.  Gammage is within walking distance too.",5
Public Services & Government,"I love downtown Tempe(and live there too).
Great restaurants(House of Tricks is best)
I am writing this in hope that the New Year eve block party will get fixed.
This years 2015-16 needed lots of help.

Admission was slow and confusing.

The promised food trucks were few and not interesting.(somebody need to go to Portland OR to get what food trucks are).

The music,especially the north stage was not much more than ""put the bass to max low frequency  and max the volume"". I recall the Nazis were working on this concept for a death ray.

What made previous years was small groups or individuals performing  around the site(I did not see any).

There was no 10 pm fireworks or not much of anything for kids.

I know the light rail has limited space by cutting off Tempe Beach but it could be expanded to Farmer district or to the East.

Despite all this the revelers seemed in good spirits!
I guess it is just hard to see how what was done in 2015 fails to meet up to what we had. ..Obviously I am getting old. 
Yeah like in the good old days.",5
Public Services & Government,Many date nights on Mill Ave while trying to make the most of Phoenix night life scene.  Located in Tempe and close to the University.  It's a snippet of the kind of night life I'm accustomed to.  But if you happen to find yourself in Phoenix and wondering what to do or where to go.  Start here.  There's a variety of restaurants and bars to try.  It's walkable and beats sitting in your hotel room watching t.v.  You'll be in college area territory so things can get interesting.,3
Restaurants,"One of the best Pretzels I have ever had (not over salted). The Pretzel Dog is simply the best thing that has ever happened to a wiener. Yes it is primarily a mall chain, but a damn good snack just the same (how poetic).",4
Restaurants,Best Pretzel I have ever had!  If you live in anthem and have a resident card...you get a free Pretzel with purchase!  Yummmmm!,5

Local Flavor,"The views don't get any better than this! 

Anywhere!  

Day or Night!

If you are at a lookout point at the top of one of the inclines, or sitting next to a window in one of the great Mount Washington restaurants, or if you are fortunate enough to have an apartment, a condo or a house up on Mount Washington overlooking the Three Rivers, you will be one of the lucky ones.  Chance has smiled down on you . . . today you will have the opportunity to see why she smiles.

She's looking down at  - - 

Steelers' Heinz Stadium
An Inland Regatta
A ""Fireworks on the Rivers"" Exhibition
Bridges everywhere - how many? Nine or ten, at least!
Pirates Baseball Stadium
A Fire engine hose competitions off the piers
Old fashioned paddle boat cruises
Ghost of the Old Three Rivers Stadium
The Golden Triangle
Concerts and shows heard across the rivers
Convergence of the Three Rivers

All this and more can be seen from the deck of my little apartment that is above tree-top level on the side of the hill looking directly across at skyscrapers. Close enough to almost touch!  Chance and I sit with our feet up sipping margaritas and watching the sun set over the old steel yards . . . 

No place on earth like Mount Washington's view!",5
Local Flavor,"well the views were good, but we were hoping for a little more in the way of coffee and food up at the top, not really much going on up there.",4
Local Flavor,"Hmmm it was all right - but was wondering where/if any places to eat were, guess you don't come up here if you want breakfast.  The view was nice, felt a little cooler than down below in town, but was disappointed there wasn't a nice street up at the top.  Looked like there were a few bar type places but not much in the way of cute street cafes.",3
Local Flavor,"Plenty of places for food. Good coffee, ice cream, some best eating in Pittsburgh. Those of you complaining-get off your butt and walk. It will do you good! You expect it to come to you? There is a coffee shop and ice cream bar within a block of the Mon incline.",5
Local Flavor,"Totally worth the Monaghelia Incline ride to come up here.

Great little walk for visitors.

If I moved here, I would totally buy a house on this block!",5
Local Flavor,"Oh the stories I could tell! As a resident of the great Mount W I've been able to experience this popular tourist spot from a different point of view. I honestly never tire of viewing the city from the mountain. It's beautiful whether it's during the day when you can see all the action downtown and all the rivers or at night where the lights transform the city into a dazzling view. 

I take walks over to Grandview frequently in the summer and I never tire of the view, but one thing I also like to do is keep any eye on the houses. It always seems as if some house is being redone along Grandview. It's fun to watch the progress over the months. Plus it usually ends up being bigger and better than before. 

The most exciting news as of late is the planned hotel right by the Mon Incline. The building has sat there vacant and ugly for what seems like forever so it's going to be exciting watching that construction. Make sure to walk along Shiloh Ave. to grab something to eat at Redbeards (full name is Redbeards Resort and Yacht club, which I think it hilarious!) or get ice cream at Difiore's. There's also a coffee shop right by the ice cream shop that is good for early mornings or cold fall nights. 

If you're feeling really up for a walk and some major hills follow Grandview west all the way to the other side of the mountain (opposite side of where the Mon Incline is at). It's honestly not a far walk at all and it's great to see the other side of the mountain. There's a good amount of restaurants on this part. The majority of them are on the pricey side. I enjoy Monterey Bay which is at the top of a high rise apartment complex or Isabela's on Grandview which is almost to the end of Grandview. 

The other Incline, the Duquesne In cline, is located here as well. This one is different from the Mon Incline because there's tons of pictures, artifacts and information on the inclines and Pittsburgh. It's also great to see the western side view of the city. You really can't go wrong from any angle up here though!",5
Local Flavor,"Best place (and it was free) to see Pittsburgh!

Definitely make a trip up here!!",5
Local Flavor,"This unique spot offers spectacular views of the surprisingly beautiful city of Pittsburgh.  

To enjoy the bird's-eye of the downtown skyline, husband and I rode the Duquesne Incline up Mount Washington and then walked a mile along Grandview Avenue to descend the Monongahela Incline.  Despite being warned by several locals that to walk between the two stations was ""impossible,"" ""not pedestrian friendly,"" and ""grueling,"" we found this constitutional to be quite doable, helped by sidewalks the whole way, and fairly easy.  

Between the two stations are several overlooks, each offering a slightly different view of Pittsburgh.  The overlooks seemingly stretch out over the river and you feel floated over downtown.  The houses, churches, libraries, apartments, and businesses along Grandview Avenue are mostly quaint and attractive, too, a vibrant, unique neighborhood giving off a welcoming, communal vibe.

If you skipped a trip up Mount Washington your visit to Pittsburgh, you'd be missing out.",5
Local Flavor,"With the second most beautiful view in the country (according to USA Today) Mount Washington is a top tourist destination for sightseers. First known as Coal Hill due to the fact the first coal mines in Pittsburgh were in Mt Washington, it slowly evolved into a community of coal miners and their families. The German immigrants designed the inclines as a way of delivering the mined coal to the steel mills down below in the south side. Two incline still remain on Mt Washington, the Monongahela and Duquesne. 

Mt Washington is also known for Restaurant row, in the Duqusene Heights section, the Tin Angel, Georgetown Inn, and perhaps the most famous, The Le Mont, just to name a few.

The Streets of Mount Washington are named after people and places of the Civil War, but don't get the same recognition of the Mexican War streets of The North Side. Grandview Avenue runs along the top of Mt Washington and offers beautiful views of downtown Pittsburgh. The overlooks are popular with tourists. Shiloh Street in the Business hub of Mt Washington, neighborhood bars, restaurants and banks are some of the businesses there. 

In the early part of the 20th century Mt Washington was Pittsburgh's Little Italy, with almost 60% of the population being from Italy. College students with it's close proximity to the schools downtown like AIP and Point Park make up a decent size portion of the population. Also, there are a lot of condos that take advantage of the view.

Plans are underway to build a mixed use building on the site of the Edge restaurant. Hopes are that a Ritz Carlton hotel will be part of that building which also calls for a restaurant, a park, and condos. 

Pittsburghers are notorious for their Pittsburghese and pronounce this area as Mount Warshington or Mt Wooshington.",5
Local Flavor,"The view of Pittsburgh from the lookouts atop Mt Washington is one of the nicest views I've ever seen of a city, it is spectacular. I wasn't aware that there were actually restaraunts up here or that the incline rail will take you to it. I'll definetely be doing that  next time, when I do I'll write an update, but in the meantime if you're going to Pittsburgh this is a must see, it's that nice.",5
Local Flavor,"Awesome views of Pittsburgh, PA. I'm sure all the locals already know this. I recently visited the city and one of the things I had to do was ride the inclines to the top of Mt. Washington and check out the views. I highly recommend anyone visiting Pittsburgh to do the same. Make sure to bring dollar bills and quarters with you because the inclines only accept exact change.",5
Local Flavor,"Great view! I was surprised there were not more tourists when we were there or there wasn't even a park or setting to enjoy the view but there was a great Incline place.  There was a great view of Pittsburgh, a little museum with history, and a ride that took you right to the bottom! I would suggest any tourist going here!",5
Local Flavor,"There's really not much for me to say about Mt. Washington other than it gives you a breathtaking view of Downtown. It's also romantic and is a good place to ponder it all while the breeze kisses your cheeks. I love that Darren brought me here on a whim. Again, as a country girl, this stuff always impresses me.",5
Local Flavor,You gotta! A must see view of the city.,5
Local Flavor,"Great for a date night walking along the sidewalk on Mt. Washington looking towards the city lights! Tthis is the place where I take every visitor we had and people always love it because the night view of the city is just so beautiful! As someone mentioned before, this is the second most beautiful view in the US (first is the Sedona red rocks). So don't miss out and come check it out!",4
Local Flavor,"Beautiful views of Pittsburgh!  What a great spot for a date, I heard of some nice restaurants near here but I did not have the time to devote to dinner.",5
Local Flavor,Great romantic view of Pittsburgh ! Lots of history too!,5
Local Flavor,"As far as mounts go, this one is pretty good. Definitely in my top 4 or 5 mounts of all time.",5
Local Flavor,We drove up here and parked to walk along and see the FANTASTIC view of the city and the rivers.  We then stopped in at The Grandview Saloon for drinks on the hillside deck with a great view on this beautiful day.,4
Local Flavor,Fun! Great views over the whole city! Cheap little ride up and back down. Worth it!,4
Local Flavor,"My absolute favorite place to go in Pittsburgh. During the summer months, it gets pretty crowded but in the winter, just grab a hot chocolate then head up there at night, and it's beautiful. So peaceful.",5
Local Flavor,"As a Realtor that specializes in city living, condos, and lofts, the mount is the place to be.  It has a great mix of single family homes and condos along Grandview Avenue.  There are big plans for more development on the mount so stay tuned. There is no better place to view the city from.  My dad lives in Grandview Towers and when I visit, I never tire of staring out at the city framed in by the three rivers.  Walk to fine dining or great lunch spots.  Take the incline to Station Square or walk the mountainside trails.  It is truly a great place to live or visit.",5
Local Flavor,Very quaint but very small. Not somewhere i would visit again. It was a nice stroll and had a great view.,3

Local Flavor,"Everyone loves Mt Washington, right? I've lived here since 2011 and most likely need multiple hands to count the times we've headed here to just hang out at the overlook The view is still as beautiful to me as it was the first time. I enjoy bringing my friends out of town here as well as family. Sometimes we head to the little ice cream shop down the street to enjoy a sweet treat. It's also fun just walking down Shiloh.. of course you lose the view but Mt Washington is a nice area. I often fantasize of renting one of those apartments & condos on Grandview and seeing that beautiful view daily!",5
Local Flavor,Picture perfect view of Pittsburgh.  Beautiful scenery. Quiet neighborhood.  You can never get bored of this place.,4
Local Flavor,"Panoramic and breathtaking views of the entire city. Spectacular at night. Gives the NYC skyline a serious run for its money. We drove up here and parked, and the entire experience was free, which blew my mind.",5
Local Flavor,"this cold ass weather is kicking my ass already...

Mount Washington...
 
These are the views remembered when its below zero degrees... Ride up one of the city's historic inclines to go up and return trip is six bucks per person!",4
Local Flavor,"Anyone who knows anything about Pittsburgh knows that Mt. Washington is one of--if not the--must see attraction in the city.  As the name suggests, Grandview Ave. offers a spectacular view of the city skyline, as well as the rivers that surround it.  There are several overlooks at intervals along Grandview that jut out over the edge of the mountain, offering numerous opportunities to take photos with the city skyline as a backdrop.

CM and I visited Mt. Washington last Sat. on the 4th of July, since it affords one of the best views in the city to see the fireworks.  I think the last time I'd been up on Mt. Washington was 2 years ago when my parents visited Pittsburgh.  I was planning to take CM on the inclines, since he'd never ridden one, despite having lived in PGH for 2 years and having visited before; however, between free parking on the Mt. and the prohibitively long lines at the bottom, we decided to save that experience for another time.  (Oh, well--it just gives me another convenient excuse to visit again soon!)  We met up with some friends to hang out for a bit in a secret abandoned lot with a great view of the skyline, but a not-so-great view of the Point, beyond which the fireworks are set off.  Thus, we ended up fighting the unwashed masses along Grandview for a spot 15 minutes before the fireworks began, finally finding a half-decent one on the first overlook near the Monongahela Incline.  My original plan had been to stake out a spot at the West End Overlook a couple of hours prior to the fireworks, but sometimes, hanging out with friends takes priority over well-thought-out plans--this was one of those times.

Despite our failure to do so, riding both inclines (Monongahela and Duquesne) is a must for first time visitors to Mt. Washington.  I highly suggest starting at the bottom and taking the Monongahela incline up, walking along Grandview, and taking the Duquesne incline back down--this is what I've done almost every other time I've visited.  As others have mentioned, there are several upscale restaurants offering spectacular views of the city near the Duquesne incline.  However, if you're hungry and don't want to spend serious $$$, there are several reasonably priced restaurants and bars with less of a view along Shiloh St. near the Monongahela Incline. (We had dinner at the Shiloh Grill on the 4th of July--see separate review for my evaluation.)  There's also an ice cream parlor and a bakery on Shiloh St. if you're looking for a snack, rather than a full meal.

Whether you're a tourist, new to Pittsburgh, or have lived here for awhile, a visit to Mt. Washington is a must.  For maximum romantic potential, I suggest visiting during sunset or at night, when you can see the city lights twinkle and the fountain at the Point in its fully illuminated glory.  It's definitely one of the most beautiful views in Pittsburgh, bested only by the nearby West End overlook, which offers a head on view of downtown.",5
Local Flavor,"Mount Washington is one of Pittsburgh's best areas. It offers spectacular views of the city and has some of the finest restaurants overlooking the city. Among these restaurants are Monterey Bay fish grotto, Altius, and the classic LeMont restaurant.

There are two inclines that service it-the Monongahela and the Duquesne. The Monongahela incline is currently closed for a 3 month renovation project but the Duquesne incline is still operable and there are some overlook extensions to take pictures. Many brides come up here for wedding pictures. Near the Monterey Bar there is a historical statue of George Washington and Guyasuta a predominant Indian chief during the French and Indian war.

If you wish to drive with a view then head up McArdle roadway prior to entering the Liberty tunnels southbound from the city.

Mount Washington provides one of the finest viewing areas for fireworks throughout the year. It does tend to get very crowded so if you want to catch a different glimpse of them head over to Grandview Park near Bailey Ave that is another hidden vantage point.

There is a nice bakery called the Grandview Bakery you might want to check out. Shiloh street is the main business district. Sycamore street is indeed a challenging drive along with its windy roads. That street is often used in bike marathons.

Finally the neighborhood is graced with vintage homes worth looking at. Most of the city's tunnels including the Wabash tunnel run through it.

It is a great way to see Pittsburgh and the north shore from a higher level.",5
Local Flavor,"Gorgeous panoramic views of the city.
Nightly recommend!!!
Free parking right along grand use ave with overlooks jetting out",5
Local Flavor,A MUST IN PITTSBURGH!! It's a bit confusing to get to but locals are always walking around over there and are nice enough to give directions. Do not miss out on this beautiful view,5
Local Flavor,"This place is gorgeous, romantics and just awe inspiring. Every time i come here, it's always a new experience and revelation. Also i like the church here. Must see place in Pittsburgh",5
Local Flavor,Perfect spot to see fireworks and look at panoramic views of the city! Definitely much better at night but still amazing during the day ride to incline up and get the full affect parking is free! Stunning and a must for any visit to the Burgh!,5
Local Flavor,"The best view of the entire city.
Best to visit during summer. We visited in mid December and had a tough time even clicking some picutres because of the cold weather.",5
Local Flavor,Beautiful view. Must see if you're in or anywhere near Pittsburgh.,5
Local Flavor,"Loved this area. Drove up and hung out at the lookout and took pics, then walked around and got lunch and drinks at a local bar restaurant. Cool spot to visit. A must for out-of-towners like me. Haha!",5
Local Flavor,"This is absolutely the best way to take in the Pittsburgh skyline! As a former resident of Pittsburgh, this is where we would always take out of town visitors, and there are a few outlooks for pictures too. Sometimes you'll see wedding parties taking pictures (using the skyline as their backdrop) after having rehearsal dinner at one of the restaurants on Mt. Washington. The best way to get to the top is to take one of the two inclines (Monongahela will get you closer to the center of the action) so not only you get a great view going up (and down) in addition to once you are at the top. Plus, parking is a hassle and the incline allows you to skip all that. Grandview Avenue, the main drag through Mt. Washington, is dotted with some really great (and a couple that have gone severely downhill) expensive restaurants, many offering breathtaking views of the city from dining tables. If you want a little more casual, but still great food, try Shiloh Grill for similar views but at more affordable prices. Also, if you like cocktails (or any kind of adult beverage for that matter) check out The Summit-it's open air in the summer and a perfect spot to grab a drink (or two). Mt. Washington is surely one of the highlights of Pittsburgh and is a spot that I truly miss now that I no longer live in the 'Burgh!",5
Local Flavor,"I will never. Ever. Get over this view. This is my favorite spot in the world. The overlook is just so breathtakingly beautiful- you get a panoramic view of dahntahn (haha), point state park, the 3 rivers, and the stadiums.",5
Local Flavor,"Being a tourist visiting Pittsburgh, and traveling without a car, it was a bit difficult to find stuff to do in the middle of February.  It was Superbowl Sunday, and we had time to kill before the Big Game.  We had lunch at Primanti Brothers and someone suggested taking the T-transit to the Monongahela Incline to come up here.

Fortunately for us, it was a nice day (in the 40s), sunny and relatively clear.  We took the incline (free with a T-transit transfer) and took photos of the city of Pittsburgh and the 3 Rivers.

There's nothing negative to say about this outlook, and pretty much the highlight of my trip to Pittsburgh.",5
Local Flavor,"Summary: Go For the View. At Night.

The Goods:
- The view over Pittsburgh, especially at night. (Recommended).
- The view over Pittsburgh, on a sunny day. (It's okay.)
- Combine your view with a Monongahela Incline ride (the Duquesne Incline drops you in the non-view/pricy restaurant portion of Grandview Ave) to expand the experience.

The Bads:
- Parking. It's limited.
- There really isn't much else to see or do in that rarified air. A few pricy restaurants on the western end of Grandview Drive (must have a great view, because they are on the view side of the street), and a few local places in the neighborhood. But, unless you are into mixed architecture residential areas (old Victorians next to 1950s bungalow, next to 1970s crap), you have no reason to tour.

The Uglies:
- None.

Bottom line: I take folks up for the night view regularly. Once the weather warms up a bit, I may even go with a folding chair to chill on one of the overlooks.",3
Local Flavor,"This is the best place to see Pittsburgh.  There are several overlooks from which to take photos.  Of course, in the winter, it can get rather windy but the view is so worth it.  It is a great place to walk around and admire views of the city.  You can also take the incline which is also fun.  Check it out.",5
Local Flavor,Visiting Mount Washington - Grandview Avenue is always fun!!  Parking is a breeze - quarters/2 hour limit not bad.  Fun to bird AND people watch too!  Great view of beautiful Pittsburgh!,5
Local Flavor,Best view of Pgh day and night. If you're from out of town it's a must!! Park at station square and ride the incline up. There's an awesome little icecream shop on the side road!,5
Local Flavor,"the best restaurant on the mount is at my house. don't tell the cops, but when me and my friends get to a grillin things get weird.

last night we procured a bunch o' meats, and my friend joshua almost burnt his face off/singed his brows'

granted, my yard is a hillside, and my patio is the size of the flyers chance to win the cup. lets go pens.

nevertheless we cram onto that patio, fire up the 88.99 dollar kingsford 24inch grill, and get to work. 

the menu last night consisted of:

shop n save pre-packaged teriyaki/sweet bbq chicken kabobs: delish.

hamburger man meat: to die for

steak: to be revived and die for again.

ribs: just run into traffic after this one cuz life ain't gettin no sweeter. go pens.

& and little baby turkey meatballs: toss em in the air, catch em in your mouth, point to the sky and thank baby jesus for letting us feast.

throw in a whole bag of lays bbq chips and you've got yourself the greatest meal in pittsburgh. 

1000/10",5
Local Flavor,"This is THE place to get a Bird's-eye view of Pittsburgh downtown, parking can be limited during busy hour. If you have a out-town guest, this is the place to take them to get some scenery pics of Pittsburgh downtown.",5
Local Flavor,"As told by Damon Gogh:

There's nothing I could say to make you try to feel okay,
And nothing you could do to stop me feeling the way I do.
And if the chance should happen that I never see you again,
Just remember that I'll always love you.

I'd be a better person on the other side I'm sure.
You'd find a way to help yourself,
And find another door.
To shrug off minor incidents,
And make us both feel proud.
I'd just wish I could be there to see you through.

You always were the one to make us stand out in a crowd,
Though every once upon a while your head was in a cloud.
There's nothing you could never do to ever let me down,
And remember that I'll always love you.",5
Local Flavor,"Meh.
It's okay for the weather.
Everything else sucks though.
The inhabitants are anti social dicks.
For some unknown reason they think they're so cosmopolitan.
It's amazingly tragic and sad.",3
Local Flavor,"If you're from a Tier1 city on the East or West coast, this city is a major fail.  If you come from, say, Chattanooga, TN, or anywhere equally as appalling such as anywhere in-between Philly and Los Angeles, this city will probably be a step up for you.

PROS:
----------
Friendly people.  Beautiful sunsets.  Beautiful desert scenery.  Cheap rent.  Beautiful weather 6mos out of the year.  Pretty decent Magic the Gathering scene.  Wonderful family.  

CONS:
-----------
A big percentage of people here are radical Christians and loony Mormons waiting for their spaceship to the planet Kolob (look it up).

There are a lot of chain restaurants and you've really got to search high and low for decent eats.  Unfortunately, most Phonecians enjoy Applebees over, say, a great Cajun eatery. 

The music scene is laughable, at best.  When the weekend's headline event is ""Hardcore is a Girl's Best Friend"", and when you go to a desert party with 2 stages of Hardcore, you know you're in trouble.  The city's DnB weekly draws crowds in the single-digits, and most events, sound-wise, are utter failures.  For instance, bringing out a huge UK DnB DJ then having the sound cutting out and clipping all night, awesome!  Want to hear Glitch?  bawahaha, good luck.  How about DubStep?  woooo!  If you're lucky you can catch the DubStep _monthly_... yes folks, 1x's a month.  Awesome.  There is literally only one weekly that's worth anything and it's the Pound which has been going strong for 1yr.  Sadly, you see the same 100 people at every event worth anything.  So in a city of 5million or whatever, 100 people know and support good music.  *sigh*  Want to hear a sick DJ like DJ Dan, Donald Gladue, DJ Icey, etc....?  Well you have 1 option:  wade through the sea of douchebaggery at Myst filled with the worst of Scottsdale and the Scottsdale wanna-be's with their $200 jeans and $150 bling t-shirts with no clue that a world-class DJ is on the decks.... THEN, you will be sadly disappointed as you watch your favorite DJ spin a watered-down set on a shitty sound system.  Sweet.

Art?  ""Hellz yeah we have First Friday"".  Yeah, 1x's a month, there's something artsy to do.  Tits.

Public transportation?  Yeah, the people of The Valley voted for the Light Rail project... a BILLION dollar debacle which provides Phonecians a single route from Mesa up to Phoenix, at a cost of $2.50 for a r/t.  Is it cheaper than driving?  No.  Faster than driving?  Nah.  More convenient?  Nope.  Does it go anywhere useful?  Naw.  It serves only a tiny fraction of our population, mainly those that find it ""hip"" to live in Downtown Phoenix.  How about the bus?  Don't know, I've never seen a bus in Gilbert.

Weather?  Miserable... you are forced to live in an artificial environment 6months out of the year because it's too hot to have a window open, too hot to even go outside.  Sure there's a lot of nice outdoors activities, but you can only participate 1/2 the year.   Don't let people fool you and tell you ""it's a dry heat"".  I don't care if it's dry or not, 117 degrees is 117 degrees.  OH, and don't expect it to cool down at night.... 100 degrees at MIDNIGHT is actually common.  And btw, it's not always a ""dry heat""... most of the summer is Monsoon season.  You actually begin to look forward to the monsoons.

How does Phoenix's weather effect your body?  Well, if you enjoy not being able to breathe, sneezing, watery eyes, bloody noses, burning your flesh on your leather seats, Valley Fever, and respiratory issues, Phoenix is the place for you!

Job market?  Awesome, if you enjoy working for a call center.

Cops?  Super!  We've got the anti-Constitution, racial profiling, show-boating, murdering Joe Arpaio.  If you are caught with even a roach or a stem of weed, you're looking at a trip to Tent City where you can enjoy our 117 degree weather from the comfort of an outside bunk bed under a canvas tent.  If you're brown and working hard to support your family, expect for your place of business to be raided, and for you to be arrested and detained, probably even deported.

Drivers?  The drivers in Phoenix are fascinating to watch and observe.  They paint the perfect picture of mental retardation.  Everyone tailgates here, going 70mph.  I defy anyone to drive 20miles on our freeway systems and not see a rear-end accident.  Multiple rear-end accidents happen daily.  Why?  Because people drive at 70mph literally inches from the car in front of them.  Now any person with an IQ over 70 would be able to understand that if the car in front of them has to stop suddenly, you are guaranteed to get into an accident.  GUARANTEED.  I am baffled and literally astounded at the fact that no one seems to understand that out here.",3
Local Flavor,"I am a fan of this city, which is why I live here.  One star withheld because the solid waste service charges are too high.  See that?  The only thing holding Phoenix back from the coveted 5 stars is that my utilities are too high.  Suck that all other cities in which I have lived.

A lot of people complain about ""Phoenix,"" but most of their complaints can be explained by the fact that they actually live in Gilbert or some other crazy suburban enclave.  You can't move to Queen Creek and then complain that there is no public transit.  You can't move to Mesa and complain there are too many Mormons.

A lot of people complain it's too hot.  If they all shut their stupid mouths, the sudden decrease in hot air would probably result in a significant cooling of the area.  The HoHoKam lived here without A/C, and they didn't complain (trust me, I've seen their cliff drawings-no complaining).  They also dug canals.  If a bunch of un-air conditioned natives can dig a miles of canals with sticks and rocks, you can't complain that it's too hot inside your Prius. 

A lot of people complain there's no culture.  How you can ascertain this when you only leave your tract home in Avondale once a month is beyond me.  I regularly trip over culture while riding my bike to work (yeah, I trip over things while on a bike).  But finding culture may require you going somewhere other than Target or Walgreens.

So yeah, I'm a fan of Phoenix, but I'm not a fan of high solid waste service charges.  Nor am I a fan of a lot of people who live in the ubiquitous Valley.  But I like Phoenix a whole lot.  I'd even give it a reach around.",4

Sure it can get hot..think theraputic sauna type heat.  The rest of the year is great! As my friends and family to the east are shoveling snow I am sitting out on my patio.  
Plenty of sun and fun here in the Valley!  I have never been lacking in options for things to do in Phoenix.  I can stay in and play or take on a hike in many of our Urban trails through the city.  We have several great places to eat and play.  There is always something new to try. 

Deciding to live downtown close to work was a decision I enjoy more each day.  But I withhold 1 star for the lack of Green Space/Parks and the unwilling nature to improve the residential/pedestrian conditions through downtown and the need to improve some of the public transportation options through town.  

But I am not just naggin' here as I am one of few that is tryin to get involved to make changes where I can.",4
Local Flavor,"I've been to many other Cities (L.A, san Francisco, Sacramento, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Tucson) And I Love Phoenix Out of al of them. From the First Class Shopping, to the Desert Scenery. It's a Ahh Inspiring City. Its not as dirty as many other major cities, and the crime has gone down so Much. its not even on the top 100 list of dangerous cities. And the people are so nice, i go on hikes and bike rides around the city and (Im not exaggerating) Every person I pass says good morning. My only con is the traffic! Around rush Hour OMG! Its Busy. But other from that I love it here!",5
Local Flavor,"Things I like:
+ D-backs games.
+ Suns games.
+ Easy in/out and layout for downtown area.
+ Many festivals and cultural events.

Things I don't like:
- Lack of parking downtown.
- Lack of nightlife downtown.  Yes, there are restaurants and bars....but there's no ""life"" down there...it's very boring.
- Heavy handed DUI enforcement.  Luckily, I haven't had a DUI, but I know many people who have and in other states they wouldn't have received it.  One drink an you're done here in PHX, no bueno.
- No ""Chinatown area"".....in a city as large as Phoenix? Finding very good, authentic Asian food is extremely difficult in this city.  The choices are far and few between.
- They say the city is ""on a grid""....however, this ""grid"" is super confusing.  As someone who moved here 2 yrs ago, there are still things I don't understand about the streets....why some streets go all the way across the ""grid"" and others change names several times.  Also, there's a 5th street in Phoenix, Mesa, Scottsdale and I don't know how many other cities nearby.....how does that make any sense?

Overall, it's not too bad of a place.  I've seen much worse.

Return Factor - 80%",3
Local Flavor,"I don't mind the heat.  People pay serious money to sit in a small room and get heat like this... and we get it for free and you don't even have to pretend like you don't see that old troll playing with himself in the corner of the dry sauna.

Good people for the most part... until they get behind the wheel of a car and then even Mel Gibson in that one movie where he's like a tough man, and there are all these crazy people in this apocalyptic world after some WWIII or something, I think it was Passion of the Road Warrior, or something like that.  Well that's Phoenix during rush hour.  You just grab your junk and pray you'll make it home alive.

There are some serious car jackoffs out there:
1) Lane - What Lane? - those folks who think that a 5 lane highway is meant only for them, and if they have to use all 5 lanes in a 100 yard span, well then 'F' the rest of you.
2) Dodge the immigrant in the back of the truck - those landscape guys who travel with half of their crew in the cab of the pickup up and I'm right behind them waiting for them to hit a bump and watch them fly.
3)Young Text/Talk Girl - yeah she's hot, but she's going to kill someone as she checks her text for a message from Chad to see if they are going to go to the mall on Saturday.  You won't be so hot with a fender through your head, honey.
4) Your Grandmother - she's 80.  Take her license away, unless you really are hankering to collect on that inheritance just a few years earlier.
5) The cops - I love 'em when I need 'em, but damn if when I need 'em I don't see 'em.

I do like the fact that everyone has a pool though.  I don't have one, but all my friends do so I basically just make the rounds on any given week and I cycle through most of them about every 2 weeks.  No one has caught on yet.

Yeah, Phoenix is all right.  At least it's not St. Paul.",4
Local Flavor,"Ok blunt and to the point. I have lived in Phoenix for 17 months and do love it here. Why the low stars? One reason. I live near Chase Field. I have written my local councilwoman, the city, etc. no one seems to care about the distaste that roams the sidewalks during our sporting events scalping tickets!! I can not walk 100 feet from my parking garage without being bombarded by these people yelling at me to buy their (what I would I assume) illegal tickets. Does it not take revenue from the venues? I have read the laws. They are supposed to be corralled in one spot off the venue property. I can tell you first hand they do not. It's like an episode of the Wire. They have young kids pulling people out of the ticket lines and dragging them across the street. All this in plain view of the police. Get with it Phoenix. Clean it up. It makes our city look ugly when people visit.",2
Local Flavor,"Well, I was in the north part of this city by Perioa. 
 
I found this area and the homes very nicely built.  The stores I visited were cool.  
The freeway from Kingman to Phoenix was clean and fresh looking.  Had to take care of personal business.
Ooooh...but that ride from Phoenix to home was a nice, thunderous lightning experience with flashes in the sky everywhere. 
   The city is quite large, so I didn't really have time to look at all the fine restaurants, etc...etc...",3
Local Flavor,"A lot's to be stated for a town located right smack dab in the middle of the darn desert where the speed limit has somehow made its way up to 75 yet......locals would much rather traverse side-by-side and talk to each other from the windows of their cars .....while texting, at 15 mph below. 

Thereon, the temperatures out this way rise higher than a giraffe's cooch... yet I'm compelled to put a cork into that complaint seeing as how back in CA, ...it's not uncommon for folks to pay for said heat. 

#sauna

(.....sighs) on a serious note, this place would honestly be perfect if they legalized the consuming of booze while walking around on the sidewalks like some other desert dwelling places we know of and/or gave the old folks their own highways to commute on thus preventing the further obstruction of traffic. I mean, seriously, ...what the hell is the purpose of having a 75 mph speed limit if you're going to continue doing 55??????!

For the most part though, unlike pretentious Los Angeles, EVERYONE I/we encountered out this way was pleasant. Good job on issuing the ""Hospitality card"" memos in advance guys; a definite extra star for that.

Then again, I suppose I'd be pleasant ^^^  as well if I was able to merely cross the border from California into Arizona and experience a recession on gas prices. What the hell is that about??? You LITERALLY cross the border into AZ from CA and fuel drops down a good $1.00/gallon like clockwork!!! I'm a little bitter about this--

Reminder: Pack a trunk full of 5 gallon Arrowhead jugs for the next trip home.

Smfh, It seriously blows my mind how scammed we're getting just for residing in a place with seemingly perfect weather. I suppose the trade off to residing in Phoenix would be that for every dime they save, it's an extra spent on the cost of air conditioning.

Choose your battles.....

I mean, the air is fresher in Phoenix.....the gas prices - lower, the roads are wider and seem to be more conditioned and void of debris, the real estate is larger yet less expensive and while Downtown Phoenix's skyline doesn't by any means rival that of Downtown Los Angeles'.........you don't need a bullet proof vest and taser just to walk around there either!

My conclusion is the granting of 4 stars. I deducted one for the Suns, lol. Yup... I said it. With this review you're one star short of a constellation.

For what's it's worth. I can see myself hanging out here more within the future. I've seen worse towns. Until my return, I recommend the implementation of this slogan:

Then, I come back to witness two ladies idling their car motor, while outside of it, for a FULL TEN MINUTES, while taking selfies and chatting.

Hope my money bought one of your employees a nice dinner!!!!,1
Local Flavor,Phoenix is a nice city right in the center of Arizona . It's dirt cheap here compared to California. All the roads seem to be brand new. The only Major Downside to Phoenix is the HEAT. It gets like 120 here in the summer. That's way to hot for me.,4
Local Flavor,"A big shout out THANK YOU to James, #914, for your help today!

Instead of just giving me my notice, he kindly explained the whole process (I've never used it before)...and THEN, he loaded my whole pile into the back of his truck and took it away for me. I know that's not his job, but he really went above and beyond and I'm very grateful!",5
Local Flavor,"Oh, Phoenix and Arizona, what have you done to yourselves, you big brat of a baby city and state!  You went from backwards to red with no improvement over the years (except a little here & there downtown).  You have been suckered by California by taking offers you couldn't afford, thus rendering the state eternally poor.  You have been corrupt and corrupted.  You have attracted weird characters from out of state and country- notably family rejects, southerners, illegals, and pigeons (the birds).  You founded valley fever.  Remember, there IS a reason why the meteor crashed into you...
circa July 1978: you lured my gullible widowed mother to move here from New Jersey with a promise of a good life, dragging me and my 2 younger sisters along.  Don Bolles and Bob Crane were murdered in Phoenix around the same time, but that didn't deter my mother at all.  The new tract 3-bed too-small fenced-in house on 59th Ave / Bell in Glendale that we settled in looked like vanilla concrete slab with an arched front (bedroom) window, sliding windows/door, and sunken living room (3 of which influenced my mother to fall in love with the overpriced house).  A far fry from the 2-story big house sitting on the lush suburban hills in north Jersey (with no private fence).  The neighborhood was full of little kids so there was hardly anyone nearby my age to play with.  We moved here with a wad of cash and ended up poor for years.  Since you don't need to shovel snow here, my mother gained weight, became a more mercurial parent, and smoked heavily due to boredom.  I personally spent 5 miserable years with her because of it, with very boring summers staying in with the a/c and doing lots of reading and watching TV, with my infantile sisters goofing around on their own.  Even Rex, the family Collie, was miserable that he could no longer run the hills back east that he, a Scottish breed, should continually be doing.  My mother held various jobs as a secretary, with social security, to make ends meet- just so she could enjoy Arizona living.  She'd work a full M-F 9-5 and come home, cook supper, watch TV while eating (we weren't allowed to talk to her at all while TV's on), and go to her room and watch more TV, then get ready for bed.  She had no pastime or hobbies.  We were pretty much left to fend for our own and figure out how to entertain ourselves.  It was a sappy cycle.  Each summer, she had to set the a/c on 80 degrees with the fan running to save on electric bills.  She promised us a pool until she found out the costs, so no pool.  Thank God we didn't have evap cooler.  The schools here were, at best, meh.  The students looked mainly trashy with no regards to their personal appearance.  My sisters' first friends had sad backgrounds: one friend had a total of 7 abortions and another was molested by her stepfather (the mother's probably 6th husband).  It was frightening to witness but to my sisters, it was better than no friends at all.  I had only very few friends because of the rampant drug problem, and I refused to have anything to do with it.  Only those who came from better money looked better.  It has been known that Arizona rates lowest in education.  I fortunately had the smarts to survive on my own and was able to keep my grades up- enough to qualify for various financial assistance to pay for my college education until I graduated (yay!).  At 19, I moved into a studio apt on my own and never looked back home in Glendale.  I wanted to start over and enjoy what's left of my teenage years that I so deserved...
My writing this review is partly therapy: a release to move on some more.  First, I got tired of enviously watching my Jersey childhood friends having had a stable upbringing and much better life, and my wishing I could move back and live with my paternal grandmother, who was very very dear to me).  Instead, she and I religiously wrote letters from 1978 to 1994 when she eventually passed away.  The same goes for my childhood friends, writing letters to keep my spirits up and so I wouldn't feel so left out their current events.  Thank-you EVERYone.  Why the 2 stars instead of 1??  Well, first, I am not angry.  The star bonus is actually due to...drumroll...my Furkids.  That's right!  My Furkids saved me and brought me renewed happiness- beginning with my first cat, Cleo, who I adopted as a kitten a year after I moved into that apt.  A succession of my adult Persians- Rudy, Brandy, and Melody joined the ranks, as well as my two Shih Tzus, Beau and Romeo.  They have been the true key to my survival in Arizona and keeping my chin up and just enjoy whatever I've had coming my way.  And, I love the snow and fireplace better than the heat and, ahem, trashy a/c.  BTW, I looked at my old 'hood in Glendale and it is now ick, the beauty's expired...
A lesson for you to consider...when something's ""cheaper"", there is always a catch....when something's ""too expensive"", there is usually a very good reason!
However, I shall def move!",2
Arts & Entertainment,"All-In-Entertainment is a company who hosts free entry No Limit Texas Hold 'Em poker tournaments Valley-wide at area bars every night of the week.  Depending on the day-of-the-week, you may have up to 12 options where to play in a tournament around the Phoenix metro and they typically have at least one selected bar in every reach of the Valley -- even the sticks like Goodyear, Surprise, and Peoria.

Back when this company started during the NL craze [maybe in 2005 or so], there were masses of people nightly at each spot.  Now, attendance has died down a bit, but there are still plenty of participants and a semi-regular tournament of the board leaders to showdown against each other for prizes like, oh, entry into the WSOP satellite events.  Yeah, kind of a big deal.

The dudes who run this impress me as they have really built up their business despite the fleeting phenomena of NL Texas Hold Em, but it appears they are still going strong ... and that small venture that started in Phoenix has expanded to 7 other cities in 4 other states, including Oregon and California.  Pretty impressive.  

If you want some practice for Vegas, you should use the opportunity of going against real-live competition for minimal risk [actually, no risk, as it is completely free except for the beers and possibly food you buy at whatever local pub you happen to be playing at -- and you should bc its how they keep their business thriving].  IMO, it is much more valuable of a Vegas prep than going against some aggressive online dweeb in Elk City, Oklahoma.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"This is the league I play in at various venues around the valley. I would normally give this a 4 star review because it's fairly well organized and fun and it's tough to fault ""free."" However, this loses one star because the owner owes me 100 bucks and refuses to pay me. 

They have a referral program where if you get a bar or restaurant to sign up with this company and host events, you get $100. Well, I referred a bar like two years ago and I have yet to be compensated. The owner dodges my calls and emails and I just find his behavior to be shady. 

Outside of that, this is a great league to play in - it's a fantastic way to learn how to play poker and it's a great way to meet people. If you're good (and lucky), you just might win a seat to the WSOP. It's also a good way to earn free drinks or food at whatever bar or restaurant you play.

I have friends who work for this company and I have met some really fantastic people through it. If you have any interest in poker, you should really go to the website and find the nearest place to play.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I have been playing Texas Hold 'em for about a year now, and this league is probably the best one to play at in Maricopa County.  They have 8-10 local pubs in the East Valley alone where you can play, and the events are pretty well attended and run quite professionally.  It's a great venue to use as practice for money tournaments at the local Native American casinos or Vegas. Not to mention I've met & dated two cute girls from these events!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I have been playing bar poker for a long time. I find that most of the time it is more like a bingo free for all. So if you are okay with something that is played with cards and looks like poker, you will be happy. The biggest issue I have with it, is that the tournament hosts engage in dissparrent treatment, when seating players. I hope to be with a group, that tries to play poker but due to the favoritism involved, I am usually at a bingo table. There are several hosts that are related and they take care of their relatives when setting up tables. It can be very hard to get to the final table when the deck is stacked against you. It also effects the quality of the experience. Most bars pay out $50 bucks for first place with gift cards for 2nd and 3rd. There are even a couple of places that pay out $100 bucks for first place. All you have to do is buy a soda. However there a places that allow players to purchase up to 5 shots and get $500 dollars per shot in poker chips. This puts you at a serious disadvantage if you are not spending at least $15 to $30 bucks at the bar. I usually just buy a soda, it's silly to me to spend $20 bucks trying to win $50. If you are going out anyway it's no big deal but for me I have no desire to spend $400 a month playing bar poker. If you are going to go play, You should learn some key phrases...but they were suited, I got someplace, I gotta be. ATC, SFL, I was priced in. The donkey's will get you, if you don't watch out.",2
Restaurants,"I so wanted to like this place.  Stopped in on a Thursday night, giddy with dessert excitement.  It took awhile for someone to acknowledge us and take our order.  The waitstaff seemed stressed, annoyed, and inexperienced.  But at this point I'm still thinking it's all going to be worth it.  What a disappointment.  The desserts we tried were bland and dry.  I tend to like things that aren't overly sweet, so it's not that I was expecting an explosion of sweetness and flavor, but I was expecting *some* flavor.  Especially for the price!  Maybe they have something worth eating, but I'm not going to waste any more of my time or money to find out.  The one plus - the water must be filtered because it was actually drinkable.",1
Restaurants,"I came to Sucré in a party of 8, including two little kids (3 and 7 years old), and I was afraid that would diminish our experience. But, that was not the case, the service was outstanding. Period. I also assumed we would be asked to sit outside, rather we were given the choice -- which may have just been a matter of good manners on the hostess' part. Regardless, I decided that we ought to sit outside so our younger dessert guests wouldn't disturb other couples. It was well after the girls' bedtime already, and being out on the town with the grown-ups that night was really special -- literally all the other diners at Sucré were obviously couples on intimate dates (appropriately, considering the hour).

My Sacher Torte was great, the girls each had Noir de Chocolat, which they LOVED pronouncing with a French accent (I feel sorry for their mother, these sprouts musta been bouncing off the walls for hours after ingesting that much chocolate!) My broher, a chef, split the Crème Brulèe Trio with his girlfriend, and they had the only complaint of the night -- apparently the texture was just (slightly) imperfect. But, like I said, he's a chef and therefore very critical of gourmet foods.

I will definitely be coming back, Sucré was nothing short of mind-blowing! And this, coming from a guy whose claim to fame in the kitchen is a Double Chocolate Torte... yes, I know gourmet desserts.",5
Restaurants,"Sucre was a nice place, if a little pricy, but unfortunately it's closed now.",4
Restaurants,"What it is: Belgian fries chain that also sells burgers.

This specific location: Cute small Frite Alors with a terrace, good quality fries with an array of different sauces. I tried the Indonesian,  béarnaise and the piccallily  sauces..with the winner being the béarnaise. I also ordered tartare, which was tasty, not too expensive & a generous portion.  

For a chain it's pretty good. 

I have yet to try any of their burgers, I just wanted to eat some fries since I very much missed my Belgische friet. Next time I'm going to order a burger & update my review accordingly.",3
Restaurants,"Service toujours un peu long, mais j'y retourne pour la poutine au porc effiloché. Les frites sont bonnes, surtout avec une de leurs fameuses sauces!",3
Restaurants,"The guys who work here are pretty nice, but the food is as mediocre as it gets. I had the Vege Burger and La Vladimir (Poutine). Granted this is my first time having Poutine, hence nothing to compare it with but it was just okay and the gravy was a bit salty for me. However I've had many veggie burgers in my lifetime and this one lands way at the bottom of the veggie burger hierachy.",3
Restaurants,"Endroit parfait pour une bonne bouffe bien grasse! Les poutines sont très satisfaisantes, tout comme les hamburgers!",4
Restaurants,"J'ai vais au moin une fois par semaine, si tu arrive avant 9h 30 il y a des bon prix",4
Restaurants,"Je vais dejeuner et diner dans ce resto depuis au moins 8 ans, mais je n'y etais pas retourné en 2 ans. Mon souvenir etait bien meilleur que la realite. Les patates dejeuner unique n'etaient pas aussi bonnes et la quatite etait ridicule pour des patates. On est tous d'accord que les patates au dejeuner c'est essentielles! 

Aussi, c'est vraiment rendu cher pour ce que c'est, 13$ pour des oeufs benedictines, avec une minuscule portion de patates et 3 morceaux de fruits? Meme l'assiete traditionnelle faisait pitiée en quantité par rapport au prix! 

Si on resume c'est pas mauvais du tout, et ca meriterait que j'essais une autre fois pour confirmer meme si j'ai ete decu...mais y a trop de bons restos dejeuner moins cher plus proche de chez moi!",3
Restaurants,"Comme première expérience, j'ai beaucoup apprécié. Le service, avant tout, est très important pour moi. J'ai reçu le service à la hauteur de mes attentes. 

Quant aux mets: les portions généreuses et saveurs délicieuses. Un endroit à revisiter lors de mon prochain voyage à Montréal.",4
Restaurants,"We came here when the breakfast place we had driven all this way for was closed. Once we were actually sat we started to regret our decision. The place look disheveled but we tried to write it off to mid-way renovations or something considering there were design awards posted at the entrance. Coffee that we declined was still left on our table with stains layering the outside of the cup. The prices seemed alright but nothing special. The plates on a neighboring table were less than appetizing. Once our food and drinks arrived however we were much happier. My eggs Benedict with mushroom and brie was perfectly cooked, the potatoes were good, fruit serving reasonable (and with fruits like plum that you don't normally get), and a fruit smoothie where I could actually taste the fruit. My other half chose the apple crepe with extra cheese and a side of bacon, his meal was service with a mocca late that he praised quite highly despite sensing a lack of that ""extra cheese"" in the crepe. The bill was about $50 after tax which to me is stupid expensive for a breakfast where you can't deliver on extra cheese, however I don't know what the extra cheese/bacon costed (shouldn't have been more than $3.00 each). The food was good but they need to work on the decor, pricing is nothing special.",3
Restaurants,"C'est un Resto ou les places sont assez tassé. Café très ordinaire, le travail d'équipe des serveuses c'est chacun pour soi au lieu de mettre le client en priorité. Les assiettes sont ok, pas plus",3
Restaurants,"J'adore la rue Masson avec sa vie de quartier. Le planète oeufs en fait partie depuis 1984.  Restaurant de brunch et déjeuner,  tout y est réconfortant pour manger en tête à tête avec son journal de Montréal.",3
Restaurants,Family owned and run business since 1971.  What a wonderful selection of homemade pastas along with a variety of poultry and seafood selections.  I indulged in the Fettucine Alla Gigi and never looked back!,4
Restaurants,"Un voyage dans le temps! Décors kitsch, portion gargantuesque. Manque un peu de finesse dans l'exécution. Personnellement, je ne suis pas un fan, mais peut plaire aux mélancoliques du temps qui passe.",2
Restaurants,"Love the decor and the food!!
It's a bit pricey, but affordable.
Service was a bit long, and they forgot my drink order.
I would definitely go back !!!",4
Restaurants,I love this place! I think they have amazing breakfasts for a reasonable price. The service is always super fast and the eggs Benedict are to die for. I go here often enough and I wouldn't go to another brunch place in the east end.,5
Restaurants,"Déjeuné OK, rien de super spécial mais bon...",3
Restaurants,"Mes béné étaient ultra coulant, pas trop mon style, et mon conjoint n'a pas été épaté par son assiette non plus. Rien qui ne mérite le détour.",3
Restaurants,"Bad service and did not like the food.
Our waitress try to accommodate with us after we expressed our feelings but kitchen was already closed. Possibly the worst breakfast place i've ever been to. Will not be coming back !",1
Restaurants,"Awesome greasy spoon that do great Montreal style steamés, poutines and burgers.

Cash only, but for unhealthy, cheap and tasty, it's the best in the neighbourhood.",4
Restaurants,"Great diner for that occasional grease-fest we all crave from time to time.

The food is exactly what you would except, the nice soggy twice-fried french fries, the steamy hot dogs, and their tasty burgers.

The staff is extremely friendly, the patrons are all regulars from the area drinking coffees and sharing stories, the decor has not been touched in probably 30-40 years (Which I personally love).

Pros: Good food, good price, great ambiance, good staff, nice retro decor, and a huge terrace.

Cons: Single toilets are cramped and dirty

All-in-all a real gem in the Hochelaga area.",4
Restaurants,"Le meilleur spot the greasy spoon. La poutine est très bonne, ils mettent même de la sauce rendu à la moitié pour être sûrs qu'il y en a partout. Les burgers et le hot-dogs sont pas chers à l'unité, parfait pour un petit snack en passant! Le personnel est vraiment motivé.",5
Restaurants,Le meilleur fast-food sur la promenade Ontario ! J'aime l'ambiance d'une autre époque de ce restaurant d'Hochelaga ! La sauce à Poutine est unique !,4
Restaurants,"I ate here three times while I was in Montreal, and most of the days I didn't eat there, I was wishing I had! Truly, for the price, the food is hard to beat. The platters are around $10 and the sandwiches even less. 

Among other things, their red-cabbage and green salads stand out -- crispy and healthy with flavorful Middle Eastern seasonings. The ""tout garni"" falafel wrap comes with creamy garlic sauce, briny pickled turnips, grilled vegetables and tahini. The shwarma platter might be my favorite -- fresh salads alongside buttery rice pilaf and tender-crispy shards of beef from the giant rotating shawarma behind the counter. Great, now I'm getting hungry just remembering it.

The staff there is wonderful: friendly, helpful and willing to speak French to a novice. Major points in my book. I wish the atmosphere inside was a little nicer, but on a beautiful summer day I would rather head for the park anyhow!",3
Restaurants,"tiny place located next to a stripclub and next to the university obviously that serves middle eastern fast food.

price is cheap, portions are decent to huge. it'll fill you up nicely. service is fast enough despite the lineup (which tends to go outside) during lunch hour because students are hungry.

love their potatoes with garlic mayo and the shawarma and i always try to get a side of pickled turnips. its like pickles, can't get enough of them!

don't expect the world. enjoy it for what it is, middle eastern north american fast food",3
Restaurants,"We popped in here for a quick lunch. The place is kind of run down and sketch but that is a lot of Montreal restaurants so if the price is right... which I have to say the price is right, the kebabs are good and the sides were great. The eggplant side dish (saksuka is what I know it as) was phenomenal. I know this is a small Montreal based chain but it was still pretty authentic and yummy. I would much rather go here than another rival chain (Amir) that I avoid at all costs.",4
Restaurants,"Another excellent ""fancy-pants"" restaurant with good meat, wine, and everything. We ate here as a large group a few months back and broke the bank, but was worth every penny.",5
Restaurants,Continental Bistro. Awesome.,5
Restaurants,"I'm not quite sure how to rate this restaurant. I gave it four stars, but I would've preferred to give it 3.5 stars. It's good, but not great. I find it just a little bit too expensive. You can eat just as well in other plateau restaurants, but for less money. Location is great. Service can be quite slow at times. They have two nice outdoor Terasse's upfront! All and all a good dining experience.",4
Restaurants,Amazing pork chop...as good as the best pork I've ever eaten.  Great Lobster salad.,5
Restaurants,"I love this place. Try the fig carpaccio, the carbonara or the horse/beef tartar. A bit pricey but always a safe pick. Kitchen open late on week-end so it's always busy. Could also be fun to eat at the bar if you're dining alone.",4
Restaurants,"What can I say, I like it greasy. I like the option of bacon and smoked meat on my poutine, and the vintage diner booths that are not ironic, just old. The fries are perfect, the breakfast is huge and under 4 dollars and doesn't come with no fancy breakfasty homefries, just regular fries thanks. Often packed, and with good reason.",4
Restaurants,"i'm all about greasy food, but this place is underwhelming at best. i live nearby so i go once in a blue moon when nothing else is open. the fries are alright, but the onion rings are probably the worst i've ever had. 

all that aside, i almost got run over by a nouveau system delivery car last week, who seriously sped up as i was crossing the street at a pedestrian crosswalk. be wary!",1
Restaurants,"Pour ceux qui veulent retrouver la forme et se mettre en bikini, cet avis est à déconseiller. Pour ceux qui cherchent un bon burger, une bonne poutine sans trop de fla fla, Nouveau Système est le parfait endroit. Ce qui est le plus cool de cette place, c'est que vous pouvez passer votre commande, elle sera prête hyper rapidement (moins de 10 minutes et des fois, même moins de 5), et vous pouvez l'emmenez au bar d'à côté si vous préférez rincer votre fast-food avec une bière. C'est bon pour ce que c'est et ça n'est pas cher. Les banquettes sont confortables et le service hors pairs. Oui, oui. Même pour un ""dinner"" à la québécoise, le service est excellent. Donc quand l'envie d'un p'tite bouffe graisseuse vous prend, c'est un endroit à considérer. C'est aussi simple que ça!",4
Restaurants,"I have only eaten here once for breakfast, 
It's an old school diner that serves good, honest grub.

The breakfast is super cheap and generous.
But it's good to know this place is around for steamés, poutines and such

While technically not a terrace, they do have tables outside and there's benches right there. 

I love this stretch of Beaubien with it's oversized sidewalk, helps with the businesses",3
Restaurants,"Il mange, elle boit, c'est comme ci, comme ça.",2
Restaurants,"This was the first restaurant I went to when I first visited montreal a year ago, I went every day. This last summer I visited the city again for a week, I went 3-4 times. Now... I live here, I'm going there RIGHT NOW. This is what diner food should taste like. It's typical greasy grub, but made hot and fresh. Good Poutine, great burgers, great price, nice staff and owner.

Restaurants,"J'ai seulement goûté à la poutine mais dans la catégorie des ""grosses poutines graisseuses"" elle est délicieuse! Beaucoup meilleure que celle de La Belle Province ou autres restos de ce genre.",4
Restaurants,"greasy old fast food joint in an area i used to call home. mind you, its fast food and it does its job when you just want a good old steamy or michigan or whatever.

great little spot to grab a little something, go outside and watch the world cup on the bar next door terrace tv.

there's one thing worth mentioning, one of the staff is very very soft-spoken so its very very hard to understand him at all considering he works the take-out counter",4
Restaurants,"Walking up St-Denis one night looking for a place to eat we passed restaurant after restaurant, hemming and hawing about what to choose, and finally we spotted L'Academie and remembered it as being on a list of recommendations and so we dove right in.

It was fantastic, a great save for Montreal after several mediocre dining experiences.  The food was excellent, just outstanding, and the atmosphere was very comfortable on the third level, in a nice quiet area.

I'd love to go back.",4
Restaurants,"Overrated, not worth the lineup, yet I still like going there occasionally. Why? It's quick, convenient, a good place for groups, and, most importantly, it's BYO.  Call it fast food bistro food. I'd say avoid the upscale stuff on the menu (not worth it) and stick to the pasta or the mussels.  Personally, I always eat the mussels which are pretty good, if not spectacular (although I avoid them during the warmer months when you tend to get the fat mushy kinds that have the consistency of glue). One of the challenges of the place is to slow down the too fast service which generally tries to clear you out of there as soon as possible to make way for the hordes lined up outside waiting to get in. Bring lots of bottles of wine and keep drinking them so they can't get rid of you.",3
Restaurants,"Great food, atmosphere and service.  It's BYO and there's a liquor store right next door, so while you wait to be seated, which can take upwards of an hour, you can peruse the wine selection, which while not huge is good enough for the untrained palate.  
The second we were taken to our table, the waitress took our wine, opened and iced it.  I was impressed by their attention to detail when they weren't getting tipped for the alcohol purchase nor charged a corking fee.  America take a hint! 
The pasta was great, as were the mussels.  I remember their gnocchi being fantastic as well.  I tried their dessert, but don't remember what I went with but that it was good.  The food was awesome, and it definitely didn't break the bank.  The same meal in the same restaurant across the border would cost significantly more.  Worth the trip and the wait!",5
Restaurants,"I second most of the other reviews- great, affordable food (especially the mussels au poivre with frites), comfortable modern atmosphere.  Service, like everywhere else in Montreal, can be iffy at times but I've never had any real issues.  There's a SAQ liquor store next door for BYO wine- saves a ton of $!  Great people watching in the summer when all the giant windows are open- I remember getting a third floor view of the jovial aftermath of a France World Cup win (crowds flooded the streets honking horns and waving flags so they had to block off St. Denis).",4
Restaurants,"I finally got around to eating at L'Académie this Friday. The restaurant gives off this air of Zen grandeur and European opulence at the same time while serving a fusion of Italian and French fusion cuisine. What it is really is a lot of pretentiousness and posturing, form over function, appeal over taste.

To begin with I couldn't believe the menu or more to the point how 30 years ago it was. What self-respecting fine dining institution with any sense of modernity still serves Coquille St-Jacques, Escargot with garlic butter and Parmesan Fondue as entrée? Really? In 2008? Tortellini Cardinal is not fine dining it's now been reduced to cafeteria food. All good plates when well prepared, but preparations that are passé and no longer original.

I started with the Insalata Italiana or Italian Salad.
Lovely greens, very fresh and some cherry tomatoes that tasted just awful and sticks of Parmesan Regiano with a nice Balsamic vinaigrette. Most restaurants drown their salads in vinaigrette, L'Académie seems to fear this very same thing by not putting enough dressing on the salad and the salad tasted dry.

Then as my Primo Piatto, or Plat de Resistance
I went for the Filet Mignon with a Port reduction. I'm just a sucker for steak. It was served with potatoes that had been fried whole and some veggies. The only thing that was remotely good was the Port reduction. Ok maybe the corn cob which tasted a bit funny because it was obviously not from Québec soil.

The Broccoli bouquet was undercooked and completely tastless. The carrot was also seriously undercooked. There's a difference between Al Dente and undercooked; a chef should know such a simple difference.

The Potatoes... how can a chef screw up a staple like potatoes? We all eat potatoes, we can expect better than fried whole potatoes that have absolutely no seasoning or taste, are dry and crunchy; just so wrong.

Last but no least on the hit list, the Filet Mignon. Now correct me if I'm wrong because I'm no steak expert but I eat enough steak in steakhouses and consider myself a bit of a connoisseur, but Filet Mignon shouldn't be marbled with fat and nerving right? Well I had to chainsaw this Filet Mignon and after three bites I was done.

That was it. Three bites of my steak and one half of a potato and I couldn't eat anymore. I was beyond disappointed. I knew I wasn't stepping into a high end restaurant, but it does hold up a promise of fine dining. This was ridiculous, flavourless and pretty much revolting.

Desert... there was no desert;
I couldn't take any more disappointment this evening. Why is it restaurants or chefs can't prepare simple things like a steak? This is Montreal, a world renowned steak town and this supposedly fine dinning restaurant can't prepare a decent steak? When I try out new restaurants I go for the simple items on the menu, because that's the true test of a chef. If I go to an Italian restaurant and I order the ever classic and simple Alfredo and I can taste that it comes from a starch filled envelope, when it's quite possibly the easiest sauce to prepare, I will never set foot in that restaurant again; as I will do with L'Académie.

A generous 1 outta 5.",1
Restaurants,"A great apportez-votre-vin pre-going out dinner spot. The food can be hit or miss. The moule are usually my option of choice.  Try to arrive early, as they don't take reservations. With a large group, you can spend a long time hanging around, drinking your own wines and get the bill just in time for the clubs down the street to open up. Classic french cuisine at cheaper than expected prices.",3
Restaurants,"A good BYOB if you're a big group. The restaurant is so massive that they can sit pretty well any size group anytime. Also, they don't ask you leave after you're done, so you can keep on drinking.

By no means is this a bad place, I just tend to gravitate towards places with really amazing food. L'academie is reasonable food and a reasonable price, not some place I'd go if I'm looking for a special night out.",2
Restaurants,Very nice place! Food is delish.,5
Restaurants,"Great spot because prices are reasonable, the staff is friendly, it's big so you're likely to get a seat, you can people-watch like crazy (inside or outside through the big windows), and there are lots of food choices.  I had mussels and frites, a salad to start, and split a dessert with my daughter. The bill for the two of us came to just over $50.  

I wasn't familiar with the BYOB concept but found it refreshing when the waiter offered to wait if I wanted to run across the street to buy a bottle of wine.  Casual place, lots of energy, great for a group, but fun for two as well.  I saw a couple having a more romantic (quiet) meal at the back of the second floor in a corner table, so there's something for everyone.

A fun neighborhood, so definitely check it out!",4
Restaurants,"This restaurant gets pretty decent ratings from me for its ability to accommodate so many patrons, very decent food and providing all this for reasonable pricing.

Despite the restaurant itself having a pretty modern and hip decor where they could easily follow other restaurants in the trend of charging higher for style instead of substance, they have had enough restraint to keep the prices decent.

The BYO aspect also make it decent as you can easily provide as much liquor as you want for your meal without getting charged a restaurant markup for your wine.

The food they serve is a fusion of Italian and French and while no dish really stood out as being truly innovative for fusion, their dishes are tasty enough to warrant repeated visits.

They are most famous for their Moule Frites which a few friends who were with me decided to order and were more than happy with.

I ended up getting the special Chicken Supreme which had a pretty comical name in my opinion but turned out to be quite delicious.

It was a chicken stuffed with canneberge, caramelized apple sauce and pears.

The desserts were all very delicious with Tiramisu being the fan favorite at our table.

Service was attentive and efficient, with finished plates always being cleaned up within minutes of completion.  This might have something to do with the long lines that this place can see, although at no point during the meal did we feel rushed.",4
Restaurants,"Charming place, great menu, nice to BYOW. The escargots are a favorite starter, and their main courses are prepared with care and always delicious. And the prices are surprisingly reasonable, even with the crummy exchange rates for USD. I try to go for dinner here at least once when I am in Montreal.",4
Restaurants,"I spent one long afternoon for lunch here. The place was empy and airy, bright considering it was grey and wet outside. Such a pleasant place to sit and watch Montreal stroll easily in the rain. I ordered caesar salad, it was nothing special. Definitely in the lower range of my caesar rating. The linguini dish that came later was not a disappointment, but just OK. 
I started to wander why there were always crowds in front of this restaurant before dinner? The food was nothing to brag about. It must be the space and the BYOB, with SAC right next door and all.",2
Restaurants,"I have very mixed feeling about l'Academie.  I've eaten here on four different occasions, and every time it's been a completely different experience.  Everything from the food to the service to the entire restaurant atmosphere can vary greatly.  

The last time I was there the service was impeccable.  Despite it being a busy Friday night, we were seated swiftly in a quiet area.  The waiter quickly brought us water, opened our bottle of wine, and poured us glasses.  I had several questions concerning the menu (high cholesterol makes one ask about the butter and cream content of dishes - sometimes something that looks like it won't be cream heavy is...) that were answered with expertise.  When our waiter didn't know, he promised to go and ask the chef; he returned within 3 minutes with a detailed answer.  

I decided to go with the tuna steak with coriander-lime vinaigrette; I had ordered this dish on a previous occasion and had been much impressed that they had cooked it per my request.  Unfortunately, I don't think the dish I was served on this second occasion had anything in common with the first.  I asked for my tuna to be cooked rare, almost blue.  I order tuna at restaurants because I find that the slight searing beautifully complements that raw interior; it's like sushi but better.  Unfortunately, the steak of tuna that was brought was cooked all the way through, to an extent that it was almost chewy and tough.  It was like tuna out of a can, but worse.  

My companion ordered a filet mignon cooked rare; alas, his dish was similar to mine.  The sauces were very nice, but the fact that the meat was so overcooked destroyed the whole dish.  I hate to be left wanting when I'm paying $25 for a dish, yet that is what happened.

However, on the other hand, I have had some very good meals here.  The first time around, the tuna was cooked to perfection, as was my friend's steak.  The gnocchi with blue cheese is a delightful dish; I would probably order it every time, if I did not have that slight aversion to cream.  The rest of the pastas are fairly standard, nothing incredible, but a decent meal for a decent price.  I've only had Moules et Frites once, but it was incredible.  I polished off every last morsel in the largest bowl of mussels that I've ever tackled.  The veal is again a hit and miss dish; I've seen people rave about it, and I've seen  left on the plate.  

In conclusion, this restaurant gets three stars because of its high variability.  I've had a meal here that I would give five stars, but another that I would give one.  My suggestion is to stick with the pasta and the Moules et Frites; they're a little bit cheaper, come in generous portions, and tend not to disappoint.",3
Restaurants,"I'm rating this on behalf of my friends and I, because a lot of what they ordered during our latest visit helped with the overall rating.

BYOB/AVV is the popular thing to do, and it's convenient that there's a nearby store to pick up a bottle.  It's always busy and loud around dinner time so avoid coming here if you want to have a quiet dinner.  No doubt, the goings on at other tables could stimulate conversation at your own table.

If you like seafood, the mussels are a must.  This is where my friend's dishes come in to play.  Each of them ordered a different mussel dish and were surprised at how many mussels they received on their plate and how delicious their plates' respective sauces were.  I've always ordered a pasta dish and have never been disappointed with my choices.

Service has always been pretty good every time.  The wait staff is generally attentive (and they don't look that bad either).  The chairs are quite comfy even though seating is a bit tight.  Prices were pretty reasonable.",4
Restaurants,Best place we dined in while inontreal. Also a good people watcher place. Good service and fine food.  Definitely the place to see and be seen. Uber urbane,5
Restaurants,L'Académie est connu pour ses pâtes. J'ai eu la chance d'y manger une fois en groupe. La présence de 8 assaisonnements différents pour les moules marinières m'a inspiré et j'ai ainsi pris des moules plutôt que des pâtes. Quelle déception de voir arriver les moules froides. Mon évaluation aurait une étoile supplémentaire si le plat avait été servi chaud et une autre étoile si l'endroit était à la fois plus lumineux et moins étriqué.,2
Restaurants,"Good place. BYOB. Pricey food. Awesome atmosphere.

I think essentially it provided a great backdrop for the bachelorette dinner I attended, not so much for the food but for the zen and modern decorations. And also the bring your own wine thing... Helps with an SAQ next door. The experience was fun but mainly because of my group, not so much the restaurant itself.",3
Restaurants,"This place is great.  I used to go there everytime I had  friends visiting Montreal. This restaurant is loud and very busy, which is great for impressing them :).

The food is very good. I think it is relatively cheap for what you get.",4
Restaurants,"Oh, how I miss you, L'acadamie!  I love your mussels and the BYOB option, and I've shared some good meals with good friends at your tables.  The wait, however, is killer... although usually quite worth it.",4
Restaurants,"This was a nightmare ! Accused to be a thief in a restaurant for not leaving traditional 15% tip for services I was totally dissatisfied with !?

I went for dinner on a Monday. We were so hungry we would have eaten even on the side walk. We brought our favorite wine and with a super good mood we stepped in L'Academie St Denis.

We ordered one of the specials (mussels) and duck (which is actually one of their top offers). The service was incredibly slow! I had to ask 2 times to have my bottle of wince opened. In the end another waiter showed up to fill with water and, after he did his job, he returned to open the bottle. As it was a white wine I asked for a cooler with it, which came after another good waiting time (we were half way through our bottle). We ordered out choices and he didn't mentioned to us that the special comes with a soup or a salad. I had to call him again to tell him what I just found out from the next table and order the soup. It looks like eating in a place where tabled are jammed pack one next to the other is a good thing after all. 

The food was ready in a decent time (or maybe it was just the wine to make the wait look short). The soup was good, mussels were very good (but I noticed they reduced the portions comparing with before), the duck was average with canned-like sauce.

So much sauce, so much grease ... I asked for more bread. It seemed to us we could have jumped naked on a table not to catch the attention of our waiter. Another waiter came with the bread.

We were so not happy with the service. Everything I asked was like a battle: had to literally wave to catch his attention, every time he came with something he was throwing them on the table. He looked like if I were to bother him more he would spit on food before bringing in.
Anyway, we made it through and we asked for the bill right away, no desert as we had too much (too much of a bad service).

So now the nightmare part! We decided to leave him exactly 10% of the price before taxes. This would have been an alarm bell to struggle to provide a better service next time. It seems like he didn't need any bell. He didn't pick the paper slip from the table but he put his finger on it to point to the tip! And then he explained me what the price is, where the taxes are, where the total is and where the tip line is. I told him I knew all that and that is all for his services. 

He  actually had the guts to bargain with me: ""What, that's it!? For the whole night!? You asked me to bring you that, open you that, more that...and that's it!?"" So I told him ""You know, guess what? Now that you mentioned it ...."" and I took the slip back from him to adjust the tip. He literally pulled out the paper slip from my hand and started to scream (yes to scream): ""You know how this is called? This is stealing!"" I said ""That's it! I want to talk with you manager!"" Of course he left and never called the manager but just continue with the other tables. I asked another 2 waiters until the manager actually was told to come at out table. I asked him to bring back my slip where I adjusted the tip to zero. I explained him the situation and left the decision to him.

Accused to be a thief in a restaurant for not leaving traditional 15% tip for services I was totally dissatisfied with!?",1
Restaurants,"Visited L'Acadamie with my mother recently since I had been here once before and remembered it was a BYOB. The restaurant can be deceiving from the outside but there are three stories and it can handle a lot of people. We went somewhat early on a Friday night and it was packed already. Since there are three floors the noise level got to be a bit much but it wasn't the reason why I would only give this place two stars. 

I ordered the mussels Marinier and my mother ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola. The meal was pretty good, food wise but the service was terrible. There was one guy who gave us water and bread, another guy that opened our bottle of wine and then a third who was our actual waiter. Not once after receiving our food did our waiter return to check on our food or ask us if we needed anything but he had to pass our table multiple times in order to bring out food to other tables, clear things, etc. so it wasn't like we were in the back of the restaurant and he had forgotten about us--it just showed he didn't care. 

Since we were planning on having a leisurely dinner anyways we didn't realize how late it was and how long we had been sitting there after finishing our food until all the wine was gone and we had run out of things to say. In total, we were there for 1 1/2 hours! It took us nearly 10 minutes to try and get our waiter's attention just to get the cheque! And when we did he started to clear our dishes and took away my mom's pasta dish which was more than half uneaten without asking if she wanted it wrapped up--we thought it was very rude of him to assume that an uneaten plate of food was to be tossed in the dumpster. He also did not ask if we wanted dessert or coffee/tea which meant he made less on the tip. Overall, terrible service from our waiter (Adil) and since we had to fight tooth and nail to get his attention, my mom thought he deserved no tip at all. He never once checked up on us, asked if we needed anything, nor did he generally show that he was working for his pay. This is the first time we haven't left a tip but he deserved it.",1
Restaurants,"Un des restaurants que j'aime beaucoup à Montréal. Oui, le service est lent, mais le choix de nourriture est varié et j'ai rarement été déçu par les différents plats que j'y ai essayés. Un bon endroit pour des groupes, autant que pour un tête à tête ou une soirée avec la famille ou des amis.",4
Restaurants,"I am so surprised at all the negative reviews. This is a place we have been known to queue up in the snow to eat at. It is always on our itinerary when we visit Montreal. A trip up there without dining at L'academie would feel incomplete. I have never had a bad meal here. I usually get one or another variety of the moules et frites. I'm a big fan of the curry ones but most of the ones I've tried have been fab. The penne a' la vodka is delicious too as are the grilled langoustines. The restaurant is BYOB and there's an SAQ conveniently right across the street. I much prefer to come here during lunch. It's a little cheaper, you avoid the crazy dinner queue, and it's less manic. Plus I love to sit by an open window on a sunny afternoon and enjoy my meal.",4
Restaurants,Food is decent. Service is so-so. It is a so-called fast / semi fine dining. What can you expect from a bring-your-own-wine place?,2
Restaurants,"Solid 3 stars right down the middle. They never accomplished a top performance. But they are consistently good enough. 

For the money and considering its a bring your own wine, L'Academie gets a C grade! Why eat at home when you can go out for a minimal cost?",3
Restaurants,"I suppose it's a good place if you like bringing your own booze, otherwise they pressure you to order lots of food and the food is not really the showcase. I had the pasta and the price was right, but there are just better options.",2
Restaurants,"J'avais entendu parler de l'Académie, en bien et en mal. Une amie a proposé ce restaurant pour une soirée d'amies d'Université, pourquoi pas ! Nous pouvions apporter notre vin (important pour un budget serré)

Points + : La place est joliment située au coin de duluth, le 2e donne une vue magnifique sur la rue st-denis, le restaurant est propre, les employés sont gentils et prompt à répondre aux demandes. 

points - : Le prix des assiettes compense pour l'alcool ... Plusieurs d'entre nous avons pris des moules (recommandées par le serveur). 2 d'entre nous , dont moi, avons eu une intoxication alimentaire ce soir-la... et une autre fille a croqué du sable a plusieurs reprises... moyen. Aussi, ils ne prennent pas la carte de débit ? Quel restaurant franchisé d'envergure ne prend pas la carte ? Nous devons retirer d'un guichet ATM ( avec frais, bien sur ! )

Je suis vraiment mitigée, un restaurant offrant des moules et ne sachant pas les faire de la bonne façon ne mérite pas que j'y retourne, pourtant, je serais prête a essayer les pâtes si j'avais a y retourner.

déception !",2
Restaurants,"Situé à quelques patés de maison de mon appart (pendant mon Erasmus), c'est un MUST DO de Saint-Denis, je vois pas mal de commentaires négatifs et bien moi, je n'ai jamais été déçu. L'académie, c'est un restaurant où les serveurs sont en phase d'apprentissage, d'où le nom je pense. 

On peut y apporter sa propre bouteille de vin (contre un droit de bouchon) et on y trouve différentes sortes de pâtes et de moules (?). Le cadre est classe et sympa et accessible à de grand groupe. Idéal pour aller manger avant une bonne grosse soirée.

Moi j'aime bien :D",4
Restaurants,"This was the 2nd time at this nice bring your own bottle place.  There is a provincial liquor store across the street and we chose a Mouton Rothchild white and a 2004 Chateau Labegorce Margaux red.

To start, we had escargot, fried calamari and mussels.  Soup du jour was a veggie puree.  Two had beef and I chose duck.  Red meat was tender but breast was a bit tough.",4
Restaurants,"don't go here.
after reading reviews, i went to it.
i and my friend ordered 2 pastas. they were horrible taste.
alfredo didn't have anything. only it and sauce.
if you are very hungry, i want to recoomend here.
they serve huge amount of pastas",1
Restaurants,Ended up here after Tasso's was closed(Sunday). Fantastic ambiance- three stories high with a great patio and open window concept. Bring your won wine and no corkage fee makes this a plus as wel (SAQ right across the street is very convinient.)l. The food was decent but the experience was great. Really romantic and the window view gives you a great setting. . Definitely worth going to if you're new to Montreal or just trying to do something different.,4
Restaurants,"Not a bad BYOB. We ended up there on a busy Saturday night, but we were seated within five minutes for a group of ten. Service was slow at parts. The bread was good though (fresh and still warm). I ordered a Filet mignon, and it was delicious (nice and tender with great flavors). Pricing is a little high for small portions though (I would have expected slightly more sides with the beef. Overall, food is good, service is slow, price is a little high. Not a bad place to start off an evening with friends.",3
Restaurants,"We went here on a Saturday for a friend's birthday supper. She had made reservations 2-3 weeks in advance for a group of 25 for 9pm. She was given a long speech about having everyone there on time otherwise her reservation would be given away. All 25 of us showed up by 8:50, but the hostess refused to seat us and she made a big stink about us blocking the entrance way (which, mind you, is really small). So she shooed some of us outside, and was quite rude and hostile. The birthday girl requested to speak to the manager because this was just ridiculous; the manager didn't seem too bothered for being a hypocrite and had us wait until about 9:20 to be seated. Their justification was that she had made the reservation for 22 people, not 25 and it was so much harder to find an extra table to accommodate the extra guests. 

Finally being seated, our orders were only taken at about 9:50; we were given bread to munch on, but in contrary to other reviews, it was cold and a little stale. Our waiter and waitress were nice, which was probably the only reason why I'm giving this an extra star. I ordered the Italian salad and fried calamari as my entree. We only ended up being served at after 11, and unfortunately for one of our party members, he was only served going on 11:30 because of an apparent order mix-up; he was compensated with a free dessert only after having pressed the waitress for one. Prices are high for the quality of food; it wasn't terrible, but it doesn't stand out in my mind as amazing. For dessert, my boyfriend Danny and I shared creme brulée, which was pretty good, but again not OMG amazing. 

Not too long after finishing our meal and enjoying the rest of our alcohol, a manager (I'm assuming) came around, and without any tact or manners, said he was closing the doors in 5 minutes and we had to get out. Quite frankly, the experience left something to be desired. I will not be coming back here because they seem to lack the basics of customer service, and the food isn't anything to write home about.",2
Restaurants,terrible and expensive..  very cheap food quality..,1
Restaurants,"Normally this place was OK. But we went there recently and the service and food were both Disgusting.  

Our server was an Asian guy who told us the calamari was only ""pretty good"" but better than the muscles. 

That was the vibe to start our night: a server who didn't even like the food. So we ordered with that great attitude as our starting point.

We got snails, calamari, and the cannelloni.

Snails were good.

Calamari was rubbery.

Cannelloni (after waiting very long time and offered more bread to compensate) tasted microwaved, rubbery. 

The server then got mad at us for complaining, saying that him and the staff tasted the food and it was fine.  (btw, we NEVER usually complain.. takes a lot for us to complain).   

When he brought the bill, he said that next time he would charge us for food we return.

There won't be a next time.",1
Restaurants,"We went t St-Denis location yesterday for our anniversary.
I took a soup and Roquefort mussels, my husband took smoked salmon and spaghetti bolognese. 

In the beginning it was good, the starters arrived fast and they were quite good. 
However, after they took our plates away we waited for about 1h (!!) for the main course. It looked like everyone around us who arrived 0-30 minutes later than us was served much earlier than we were. Being still hungry we even ate all the bread while waiting. Not my preferred source of calories, to be honest.

When the main courses finally arrived, we received no apology or anything like that from the waiter. She acted like nothing happened at all. 

On the bright side, mussels were really tasteful, big and meaty, and the sauce was delicious. I wish I didn't have to eat that much bread waiting for them. In the end I couldn't finish my meal because of that. 
I would note that they could have put more fries on the side. The quantity was fine with me, but for someone with bigger appetite or someone who didn't take an appetizer it might have not been enough.

My husband was not as lucky, his spaghetti were very mediocre, the sauce tasted more like stuff from a can. He merely finished a half of it.
And oh, food presentation was also very poor.

We left without coffee or dessert because after 2h+ meal we weren't sure how long it would take them to serve dessert and we didn't want to miss our train.

All in all, I wouldn't go back to the same location, but I would give it another try in T-Can location that's closer to my home to see if the experience will be different. 
The mussels were indeed great, the atmosphere was nice and casual, and the bill ($40) was  reasonable for what we got.",3
Restaurants,"It saddens me that this place has such subpar reviews. This was the first restaurant my friends and I landed in after getting sadly rejected by another restaurant down the street. We had just driven for a few hours and just wanted to eat. First of all, this place is three stories. Holy crap. But not only is it three stories, the service was SPECTACULAR for us. We ordered the food and it came out in less than half an hour. We had escargot, mussels in some sort of sauce with cognac I think??, duck in raspberry sauce, and seared tuna. I honestly cannot speak more highly of the food.

The duck in raspberry sauce was genius. Never would I ever have thought of something so clever. The mussels in the cognac broth was also really different but such a creative way of cooking mussels. 

I think my favorite part of the meal was when we asked for the dessert menu and the waiter just walked out with an entire tray of desserts. That was pretty sick. We ended up not ordering dessert, but the overal dining experience was fine. 

Honestly, I really don't understand why this place has such poor reviews on Yelp. It's a really solid find, and even though we went on a busy Friday night, we were still able to get seated in a packed restaurant and we got food within a reasonable, actually quick, amount of fine. 

tldr; great place, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone as a solid dinner option in Montreal",4
Restaurants,"Cuisine inégale, rapport qualité prix médiocre.",2
Restaurants,"L'academie is well..... L'academie. You don't go there for the fantastic food (let's be honest, it's not all that great) or the service (it took our waitress 3 tries to get our bill right which in the end was still wrong). But you go there for the cheap dishes and BYOW.",3
Restaurants,I was 2 years ago that I had been here. The lasagna was so yummy that I cannot forget.,5
Restaurants,"Ok I would probably give this a 1 star based on food alone. They used to have an amazing gnocci but now have removed it from the menu (why???) so I got the fettuccine alfredo which was....... not good. honestly felt sick after eating it. Just not flavourful at all. So food is not so good, but where this place makes up for it is the experience, when you go with friends with one bottle of wine each really nothing beats that. It's better to go Sunday-Wednesday nights though as the pasta prices are nearly half off!!! It's crazy actually to think that they try to charge $17 for that awful fettuccine alfredo on weekends... absurd.",2
Restaurants,"Bon, mais rien d'exceptionnel. Sauf la soupe d'entrée, un régal (la même que celle que fait ma mamie !!)
Pour le reste, les plats ne sont pas à la hauteur des prix affichés... (dans la partie haute des $$)",3
Restaurants,"The food was excellent, but there was an enormous problem. Both my girlfriend and I , who ate there for our fourth anniversary dinner, had the absolute worst food poisoning of our lives after the meal. And we know exactly what it was-we split an order of the fried calamari. It was the only thing we shared all night and it was delicious, but six hours later it hit us and we were in for about 16 hours of nearly non-stop vomitting and other unpleasantness (which was made much worse by the fact that we had to take the train home that day). In fact I just woke up after passing out immediately on arrival and sleeping for 15 hours. Absolutely ruined the second half of our vacation.",1
Restaurants,"Plutot decevant comme experience. A plusieurs reprises, nous avons du demander pour du services. Malgres que courtois, les serveurs nous servaient des excuses bidons pour expliquer le delais. Il semblerait qu'un steak bien cuit a besoin d'Une demi-heure, voir plus... Pourtant, les patates etaient encore dures. Le steak, lui, etait carbonise, alors que le fois meduim-saignant etait bien cuit... A croire que leur evaluation est un peu biaisee. Apportez quelques bouteilles pour profiter du temps d'attente.",2
Restaurants,"We ended up at L'academie kind of randomly, and while the food was alright it wasn't really memorable either.

We did a fondue Parmesan to start, which was apparently a fancy fried cheese stick, then a pasta and tuna dish for mains. Both were good, but very straightforward preparations with nothing really standing out. On a street packed with such excellent restaurants, I think it's tough to recommend this one.",3
Restaurants,This is my favourite middle class restaurant. Every time I come here I always receive quality service and excellent gourmet cuisine. They hosted an event for the McGill Management International Case Competition and the attendees loved the cuisine! The best part is you may bring your own bottle (BYOB) and they provide the glasses and ice.,5
Restaurants,"Ate here last Friday night along with my girlfriend when visiting Montreal. It was a recommended resturant from a local that I work with. It did not dissapoint. 

Showed up at around 8:30 pm with no reservation. Was givne a table about 3 minutes later... 

This resturant allows you to bring your own wine, I did not know that.. I got up and went over quickly to the liquor store directly across the street, and got a nice bottle of California red. Don't show up without a bottle to this place.. it's goes great with the food!

The bread they serve complimentary was delicious! I had more than my fair share. 


We both opeted for the set menu that included soup and a coffee/tea at the end. We also had a couple of tapas - the calamari which was served chilled, and another which I can't remember, but it was also excellent. (not listed online)

The soup we had was a lime and watercrest based soup, and it was very good. 

I had the 1/2 rack of ribs and beef dish with frites.. The ribs were excellent, the beef was okay.. The fries were perfect. 

My girlfriend had the salmon dish - it was excellent. 

Portions here are very large, atypical of a French resturant or one that you find in Montreal. 

Our waiter even offered to give us cappacinos even though it was not included. We ate a ton of food, and the bill was about $70 before tip..

This place will be repeated when we return next time to Montreal.",5
Restaurants,"L'academie is overrated. This establishment is popular because of its relatively reasonable prices and bring-your-own-wine option. However, the positives end there. The food is mediocre and uninspired. But above all, the service is poor. It seems that the servers have too many tables to attend to, and are harried and rushed as a result. Once, we asked the server for pepper flakes and she said ""they're right there,"" gesturing to a service table. So we were supposed to reach over and take them? We were stunned. The waitress was unfriendly throughout our meal besides being very brusque. Would never return.",2
Restaurants,"Service médiocre. La nourriture digne dune cafétéria d'hôpital .Jai pris comme entrée l'aubergine gratinée. Jai reçu une vulgaire tranche d'aubergine d'environ 4mm d'epaisseur avec du fromage dessus pour 8$ !! 8$ !!! Plat principal ,escalopes de veau (super gluantes) avec des pates au beurre beaucoup trop cuites. Mon conjoint a commandé une salade et a sa deuxieme bouchée il a trouvé une motte de vieille laitue pourrie en boule au centre de son assiete ! Le seul point positif c'est que c'est un ""apportez votre vin "" Je déconseille fortement !",1
Restaurants,"I went to l'Academie last night and was very disappointed by the Manager's attitude towards our group. He was very cold and mean with us and without talking about it we all felt the same way. We did mention it to him and he had nothing to say and never apologized. The first rule of customer service is that the client is king and, even if he disagreed with us, a decent apology would have been the appropriate thing to do.
That being said, our waiter was great and the food excellent as usual (we go to l'Academie at least once a year but it was our first time at the one on St-Denis). Will not come back to this one in the future for sure! The one on Crescent is 10x better :)",1
Restaurants,My friends took me to L'academie last night for my birthday ! We all love L'academie the food is always delicious and the ambiance very pleasant plus its BYOW! Everything was fine until the so called manager of the place interacted with us in the rudest and most inappropriate way! We did mention to him that we had not appreciate the way he had talked to us but he did not even hint a pinch of remorse. Quite frankly  a fake apology would have done it for me but i guess he judged that we were not even worth that. So clearly i don't recommend this place. I will stick to the one on crescent!!!!,1
Restaurants,"I would've liked this place much more if they didn't force us to eat more food than we actually wanted.

Let me start by saying I appreciate the fact they're BYOB with NO corking fee (which is unusual in the good 'ol U S of A). There is an SAS right across the street, so you really don't need to be ordering a bottle off their menu. I also appreciate that it's massive: three floors all with huge windows facing Rue St-Denis. Bottom floor keeps the windows open when the weather is nice, while upper floors keep the windows shut (but I'm pretty sure they can open). Service was cut & dry. Sometimes it's refreshing to have a server spend as little time possible at the table so we can enjoy our drinks (although a check-back after the main dish came out would've been nice). 

The menu is nothing to brag about. There's a lot of options if you're a seafood or meat fan, but only one or two for vegetarians. We (initially) got the arugula parmesan salad to start and the pasta with tomato sauce / red peppers. The pasta was really tasty actually, and we definitely enjoyed it. The salad... was exactly what we expected. But then we were told we HAD to order either two main plates, or two appetizers and one main plate. I have *never* heard of a restaurant that requires their patrons to order a minimum amount of food (excluding table service at a fancy club or something). Just because we were two people means we have to eat more? What if we don't want to? What if one is watching their weight? What if one is allergic to nearly everything except one item on the menu? Do they not want more profit? Why would they [potentially] lose a customer because they aren't ordering more food than desired?

These are the real questions of the universe. Had we not already opened the bottle of wine when sitting down, we would've easily walked out of the place.",2
Restaurants,"I'm so glad we gave this place a chance. Myself and three others were on our way to another restaurant down the street when walked past this place and decided to give it a try instead.
It's a huge place and we walked right in and were given a window table on the second floor overlooking St Denis.

On the night that we went a lobster special was on offer. $26 for a full lobster with sides. An amazing dish. I had the spaghetti carbonara which was delicious and completely satisfying. 

 Another great feature is bring-your-own-wine. (with no corking fee) Luckily there is an SAQ right across the street, and we grabbed a bottle and a few cold beers.",4
Restaurants,"I have been here twice now and I will continue coming here every time I come to Montreal. I have had consistently good service and food quality, the place is always lively but not overcrowded, and it's in a great location. 

Come on a Sunday-Wednesday night as the pasta and mussel dishes are half off those nights! It's an amazing deal and the BYOB policy saves a bunch of money as well, plus the SAQ is right across the street. 

Have fun and bring lots of wine!",5
Restaurants,"Mussels and fries. The mussels were so small, tasted good and well cooked, but....so small. Fries were great.",2
Restaurants,"The italien cuisine provided by this restaurant is quite good. I went there because of an activity of school. I ordered a pasta with tomatoes, spinach and shrimps. It tasted good.",4
Restaurants,"This is a great restaurant to go to in a group! It is BYOB which is great, so you can share a bottle with your friends or to yourself. The portions are very big and you get more than what you pay for. The food is decent, but it's not the best. Since the portions are very big, you can take the rest of your meal back home. The mussels and fries are pretty good.",3
Restaurants,"I have almost nothing good to say about this place. Other than you can bring your own wine and that they didn't make me pay for the food I sent back, I don't have anything positive to say. The food was horrible and if you are gluten free, I would stay away. Yes there are a few gf items like pasta but none of their sauces are gf! So what are you supposed to eat??? dry pasta. I ordered the chicken masala, without the sauce obviously and it was so dry. The server and manager tried to tell me it was dry because there was no sauce. BS! The chicken was dry because it was overcooked! My friend ordered the same think, with sauce, and her chicken was also not edible because it was so overcooked. I can't believe they tried to blame dry chicken on no sauce! My husband ordered the mussels with lemon, it was basically mussels in water with lemon slices. Even though they were cooked properly, he said they didn't taste good, they had no flavor. Most of our group left disappointing and with half full plates because the food was gross. I will never be back here and would never recommend it.",1
Restaurants,"Petit restaurant familial salvadorien. C'est un peu comme la binerie du coin, mais avec des tacos, quesadillas, pupusa et biens d'autres. Vous trouverez des mets du Salvador, du Mexique et de la région (Honduras, Guatemala, etc.).

Souvent, servit avec une sauce verte, maison, mmmm! Mais OH! LA! Picante!! Lors de ma dernière visite j'ai mangé une tortilla chorizo avec la sauce piquante tout simplement délicieuse. Les prix sont raisonnables et les portions sont généreuses. 

Vous y trouverez aussi des boissons, que je suppose être typique de l'Amérique latine, à l'arachide, cajous, riz, mangues et biens d'autres. 

L'ambiance est simple et décontracter, il y a des postes de télévision pour les soirs de match (surtout du foot).

Restaurants,"Un petit restaurant salvadorien à découvrir, la nourriture est fraiche, copieuse, pas chère et très savoureuse. Un coup de cœur pour la quesadillas mexicaine et la banane plantain, un voyage gourmand pour les amateurs de cuisine exotique.",5
Restaurants,"is it the best this town has to offer in term of latin american food? i can't say but it is THAT good though.

place is kitsch, the plastic table cover doesn't look inviting. the menu underneath the cover is a head scratcher as well as the canteen chairs. but do not let yourself be fooled by such rookie mistakes. it's all about the food and boy do they deliver.

the menu is kinda overwhelming with the many choices and not really knowing what to choose. sticking with the well known dishes is a pretty safe bet; pupusas, enchiladas, burritos, tacos, quesadillas, nachos or you can always ask the very helpful waitress. she steered me away from the orange juice (which is the minute maid variety). i was glad as i end up choosing the better non alcoholic drink, coconut water, served in a tall glass with coconut shape ice cube and pretty inexpensive to boot. they have alcohol too. the classic latin american drinks you'd find anywhere is offered here.

food wise, i settle with the pupusas (stuffed tortillas with refried beans, loroco and ground pork mixture i believe), fish and shrimp & cheese. the fish pupusa was extremely tasty. perfectly seasoned without overpowering the delicate fish taste.

the shrimp and cheese on the other hand, the cheese was simply overpowering the shrimp. you had a choice of bypassing the cheese which in hindsight, i should have. seafood and cheese? usually a big faux pas especially with shrimp.

to accompany the pupusas, you had a side of salsa verde, tomato sauce and pickled carrots and cabbage (or is it coleslaw?). the salsa verde.. holy batman, it is so spicy, i was sweating the stuff. being a guy that has no problem with bird chili and sriracha/chili paste, that salsa was simply too much. had to cut off the hotness with the tomato sauce and a truckload of slaw. the salsa, besides the spicy smell, is quite flavorful with the roasted tomatillo and lime juice.

i had a beef burrito on the go first time around which was quite filling and pretty tasty and inexpensive.

they only take cash. takeout is available as well as doggy bagging the leftovers. price is fair with 90% of the menu sitting between $10-20",4
Restaurants,I have been living in Central America for 3 years and I can assure you this is the best Latin restaurant I tested yet in Montreal !,5
Restaurants,"J'aurais mis trois étoiles, mais le service très attentionné et accueillant mérite 4 étoiles. 

Je suis dans ma phase ""pupusas"" et j'aime mieux les pupusas de la carreta, elles sont plus croustillantes. Une amie avait essayé un burritos et un autre a aussi adoré la banane flambée.

La serveuse nous a parlé de la terrasse qui ouvrait, mais nous ne l'avons pas encore essayé. 

Restaurant très sympathique et abordable. Cuisine honnête et bonne.",4
Restaurants,"J'ai commandé une petite pizza spéciale Corvette et une petite poutine au poulet, afin de voir si ce restaurant faisait des plats de base de qualité.

Quand tu reçois une pizza avec un petit support en plastique dans le milieu au lieu d'un pain, tu sais que tu fais affaire avec une place cheap. 

Et quand tu goûtes à la pizza et ça goûte la pâte congelée, ayoye. Les ingrédients sur le dessus était ""pas pire"", goûteux, mais la pâte, ouach! 

La poutine faite avec des patates cheaps, farineuses, avec une sauce qui ne goûte pas grand chose, avec du fromage qui ne goûte pas grand chose, avec du poulet trop cuit qui ne goûtait pas grand chose, ça me faisait penser à la poutine de Poutineville: bof, gros bof. 

Peut-être qu'ils font autre chose de bon, mais pas la pizza, pas la poutine, pas le poulet.

Mon échelle d'évaluation:
1 étoile: Pu jamais! Une des pires expériences de ma vie.  
2 étoiles: Bof. Fallait l'essayer. Mais je n'y retournerai pas à moins d'être obligé.
3 étoiles: Correct. Sans plus. Ça fait la job. Je vais y retourner de temps en temps.
4 étoiles: Très bon choix. Un endroit que je vais aller très souvent. 
5 étoiles: Excellent, quasi perfection! Un de mes endroits favoris!",1
Restaurants,"Meilleurs déjeuners pour un prix très bas. De plus, la pizza est très bonne. J'aime bien manger des frites à côté. 

Ce n'est pas très chers comme repas.

C'est une place que l'on aime avoir dans son quartier.",5
Restaurants,"Avant de commencer ma critique, j'aimerais souhaiter la bienvenue dans mon quartier au Yelpeur Dan D car j'ai vu qu'il est aussi un client du Corvette Express. J'ai bien hâte de faire sa connaissance lors du prochain événement Élite Yelp.
 
Ceci dit, pour ceux qui cherchent une bonne pizza et/ou une bonne poutine, je suggère d'éviter ce resto grec. De plus, je dois avouer que leurs souvlakis sont plus qu'ordinaire, merci ! 

Je vais chez Corvette Express pour mes petits déjeuners, car les prix sont très abordables et c'est à 2 coins de rue de chez moi ! Ils sont efficient (montrons qu'on a du vocabulaire.... Je suis allé dans les meilleurs écoles quand même) et sympathique. Quand je suis trop poqué, comme ce matin, je n'ai qu'à m'assoir et me laisser servir sans que j'aie à passer ma commande.

Question tolérance, je dois souligner  leur patience à mon égard. J'y ai fait tout ce qu'il ne faut pas faire dans un resto sans aucune conséquence. Ils m'aiment quand même (du moins, j'en ai l'impression..... non, ne brisez pas mes illusions.)

On y mange quoi ?
1- des déjeuner classiques ;
2- des hamburgers sans frites (faite comme moi, achetez une fritte ailleurs et amener les pour emporter) ;
3- le hamburger steak avec salade et riz.... remarquez que j'évite encore les frites
4- les hotdogs "" steamés "" toujours sans frittes.

Pour le reste, c'est à vos risques et périls, mais se sera toujours pas cher, pas cher :)
 
Je réserve les 1 étoile pour des endroits snobs comme le Lawrence sur St.-Laurent ou, oui, c'est bon, mais c'est trop cher pour ce que c'est, et qu'ils nous servent avec une très mauvaise attitude ! Au moins, chez Corvette Expresse, ils sont sympathiques...",3
Restaurants,"One word: POUTINE!  Yes, after strolling along St. Laurent, we decided what better place should we enjoy this calorie fest of a plate than at La Belle Province...a greasy spoon spot in its own rights.  The poutine was interesting and far from disgusting, but I don't think I'll be craving it anytime soon.  It was great fun experiencing this Canadian treat.",3
Restaurants,"The poutine here wasn't that great. For 6$, you get a relatively small sized serving (which is good I guess, if you're worried about the numbers on the scale). The cheese was definitely 'squeaky', but the fries tasted like they were in the fryer too long (i.e. they tasted burnt) and the gravy was nothing to write home about. But being in a state of inebriation, I still ate the entire thing. Such is life.

Considering Frites Alors is just down the street, I recommend going there instead.",2
Restaurants,"Okay, if you're hungover and you're on saint laurent after a night of clubbing, this might be the place you'll be hitting for some late night poutine.

Honestly though, the poutine here isn't that good. The cheese curds are rubbery--they literally squeak in your mouth and are not warm. The fries are also limp and are just your average frozen fries and the gravy isn't to die for either.

The staff are also over-friendly sometimes...meaning that they sometimes hit on you, and all you really want is some poutine since you're super hungry. 

If you're drunk, this place is not that bad, otherwise not worth the trip.",2
Restaurants,"Petit restaurant péruvien, de gestion familiale (les parents aux fourneaux et la fille aux tables) où l'on apporte son vin et où on mange pour 15$ un repas complet (excluant taxes et service), ça vous dit ?

L'endroit est petit et vite archi-plein et peut accueillir une trentaine de personne.  Réservez à l'avance.  Aux heures d'affluence, le service peut devenir considérablement lent, (ce qui est normal quand on songe qu'il n'y a que deux personnes à s'affairer dans la cuisine...).

Le menu est limité, peut-être 8-9 choix de plats, et manque certainement un peu d'originalité: Après tout, pourquoi se déplacer dans un restaurant si c'est pour se faire servir un poisson grillé ou un steak dans son plus simple appareil ?  Tous les plats sont accompagnés des classiques haricots (délicieux) et de salade (ok).  
Nous avons opté pour le poulet sauce à l'arachide, dont la sauce s'est avérée un peu décevante et le poulet plus ou moins grillé, et pour la brochette de coeur de boeuf mariné, dont la marinade était des plus ordinaire, mais dont la cuisson était parfaite.  En somme, pas de quoi se plaindre mais pas non plus de quoi se réjouir...

Une chose cependant a rendu notre repas mémorable, et c'est justement le genre de chose pour laquelle on décide d'aller manger péruvien un soir: le ceviche!  Contrairement à ce qui arrive parfois, celui-ci n'était pas préparé à l'avance, avec de tout petits morceaux de poisson sur-marinés.  Que non!  On nous l'a préparé sur demande, (comptez une quinzaine de minutes) avec de beaux gros morceaux de poisson (du tilapia ce soir-là), que le citron n'avait cuit qu'à l'extérieur, laissant l'intérieur cru, comme il se doit!  Servi avec des oignons marinés, le tout était à la fois délicat et savoureux, et en plus, servi dans un format gargantuesque.  Vaut définitivement le détour!  Un fait à noter: le ceviche n'est servi qu'en entrée, à 7$, et ne fait pas partie de la table d'hôte.  

En somme, ça reste un resto sympathique, sans prétention.  Le menu est un peu décevant, mais le ceviche, ainsi que le prix, rachètent bien des imperfections.  Aussi, comme d'autres entrées avaient l'air délicieuses, je recommanderais probablement aux intéressés de tout simplement laisser tomber les plats principaux et de s'en tenir à 2 entrées, dont l'incontournable ceviche, bien entendu...",3
Restaurants,"This restaurant has the perfect mix of casual, affordable dining with great service and ambiance. The combination of Mexican and Peruvian cuisine was great and you can enjoy the night without thinking about the final bill. Defiantly one to make your new local eatery in the plateau!",5
Restaurants,Had the 7 course tasting menu.  Every dish was incredible!! I will be back.,5
Restaurants,"Outre les jeunes serveuses soucieuses de bien faire et l'emplacement, ce restaurant est absolument quelconque voire désagréable. Les plats sont comestibles mais inintéressants (notons la présence de maïs en canne dans les salades et ceviches). De plus, le propriétaire ou gérant est arrogant. À côté de chez nous, donc pratique, mais nous n'avons aucunement l'intention d'y retourner.",1
Restaurants,"On our second visit to this restaurant we were not disappointed. The owner was kind enough to allow two of our party to order something from the lunch menu, lamb shanks, and they both licked their plates.
The cream of zucchini was delicious, the salad pleasant, and my roast beef was perfection. The dessert was not quite ""there"", but nice.
The service was perfect, we were allowed our space to dine and talk.
I should mention the bread, artisan and crunchy, very tasty.
All in all, we WILL be back. Truly.",5
Restaurants,"After going to the little corner store just opposite, we swung by just to see the menu and wound up deciding to scrap our pasta plans for the evening. 

At the urging of the very kind waiter, I tried the duck roll. Oh. My. God. Tender, delicious duck is a force on its own, but what happens when you wrap it in a Vietnamese-style fried spring roll? PLEASE go and find out. 

To boot, I had the Thai rotisserie chicken. Oh. My. God. Chicken and pork make up the majority of my diet and I think this was the best chicken I've ever had. Unfortunately, the chicken was served with old, dry rice and a weird medley of candied carrots and daikon (this is what lost them a star). I just moved all that junk to the side and relished in my chicken. 

If the meat wasn't as good as it was they would probably only check in at two stars.

BYOB! Really nice ambiance, too.",4
Restaurants,"Cozy little place. I've been there a few times for lunch. It's certainly not going to be a gastronomical experience, but you will have a decent lunch for a very fair price.",3
Restaurants,"Petit endroit idéal pour un souper au restaurant en semaine ou un bon souper asiatique sans se ruiner. Le restaurant propose une tables d'hôtes à moins de 15$. Le service est très bon, le propriétaire toujours accueillant.",4
Restaurants,"We really enjoy Peruvian chicken. Thankfully Eche Pa'echarle is just a few blocks from our place. The chicken is incredible! I am not sure what they marinade it in or how long they roast it, but we are big fans!

We love a good Peruvian ceviche, too, but frankly we are not 100% in love with Eche Pa'echarle's ceviche. Although it isn't bad in a pinch.",4
Restaurants,"I had the Ceviche Mixto with onions and yucca. A civiche of mixed seafood and herbs - shrimp, fish, squid, octopus, clams, scallops and surf clam - a true medley of seafood. It was extremely fresh; the seafood did not taste defrosted (maybe the fact that Jean Talon Market was right around the corner has something to do with this). Having raw seafood being ""cooked"" with acid (lime) might sound a big adventurous, but when it's done right, it can be quite exciting.",4
Restaurants,"The place is pretty simple, and they were nice enough to found  us space even if it was a saturday and we were 10 ! 

We ate a whole chicken for 4, and this is the best things to do if you're 4. You have fries, plantain chips and even soft drink for around 12 taxes included. 

So it's not expensive and my peruvian friend told me that it's like home there. I like the marinated chicken cooked on charcoal ! Have to try the sea food here later this years. I have to try another peruvian restaurants to make comparisons.

Update : i tried the Moro con hunange( ceviche) A fish ( grouper) cooked naturally with lime. It was a light refreshingly meal. I've never tried it before and i recommend you try it !

L'endroit est simple et les employés ont été assez gentils pour nous trouvez de la place pour souper même si c'était un samedi soir et que  nous étions nombreux (10 personnes). 

Ce n'est pas tellement dispendieux et  mon amis péruvien dis que c'est comme au Pérou !

Je suggère que vous commandiez un poulet complet si vous êtes 4 personnes. Les frites, les chips au plantain et 2 litres de boisson gazeuse inca cola ou un breuvage de chicha (boisson a base de maîs du Pérou, sont compris pour ce repas à un prix de 12$ taxes incluses. 

Le poulet mariné cuit au charbon de bois est succulent et je le recommande grandement ! J'aimerais cependant essayer les fruits de mer plus tard cette année !

Je dois essayer plusieurs restaurants Peruviens afin de pouvoir comparer !

Misa à jour : J'ai essayé le Mero con huang ( ceviche) : une salade de poisson cuit naturellement dans la lime ( non cuit de façon usuelle). Et c'était excellent et quelque chose que je ne connaissait pas. Vous devriez essayer cela !",4
Restaurants,"De très bonnes portions pour un prix correct, la bouffe est délicieuse! J'ai mangé la cuisse de poulet sur charbon de bois et c'était succulent. Le vin se vend à la bouteille, ça nous a couté un gros 8$ (!) pour deux bouteilles de vin séparées à 5. Un endroit simple, authentique et sans prétention... Et un gros shout out à la couverte de lama.",4
Restaurants,"Long overdue review from me about this Peruvian gem in north Montreal, just that side of the Jean Talon shopping complex. We have been to this restaurant many times, and having lived in Peru for a couple of years, I can attest to the authenticity of the menu and its preparation. The establishment is not very big, and a couple of years ago, it expanded its offering to include the famous Peruvian rotisserie chicken. Ambience is simple and on certain nights, it even offers live entertainment. Otherwise like typical eateries in Peru, there is a large screen TV with Latino entertainment.

Food-wise, it is Peruvian to the last crumb and drop. The appetizers include an amazing papas a la huancaina (sliced boiled potatoes covered with a savoury and creamy yellow pepper sauce and garnished with sliced boiled eggs and black olives), and tamales (cornflour dumplings with pork stuffing) among other favourites. Ceviche abounds with various seafood, and is served in traditional style, i.e. large grain Peruvian corn on cob, a piece of boiled yucca, and the ceviche itself of whatever seafood marinated in a piquant salad of red onions, peppers and lime juice. Not to be missed! Main entrees include savoury stews (try the chupe de camarones with the extra large shrimp in shell!), aji de gallina (shredded chicken cooked in the aromatic and savoury Peruvian yellow pepper sauce), arroz con mariscos (seafood served with rice prepared with cilantro - something like paella), and of course the rotisseries chicken. 

I am not too crazy about traditional Peruvian desserts, I find them too sweet for my taste but for those who like them, they also make sweet rice pudding, alfajores (cookie made of flour, nuts and honey, and a centre filling of caramel), and ""flan"" (sort of custard tart without the crust, lightly covered with sweet syrup). The place also serves traditional Peruvian chicha (lightly sweet beverage made from purple corn - refreshing flavour) and of course Inka Kola (Peru's answer to Coca Cola; a bright yellow soda that tastes like cream soda).

The prices are somewhat on the high side but it is well worth the visit to sample what I consider to be best of South American cuisine which is expertly prepared here. In fact, Peruvian cuisine has now caught on in New York and Western Europe as more people have discovered its remarkable range of spices and flavours so unlike any other neighbouring cuisine in South America. If you like Mexican or Indian food, you will LOVE Peruvian food.",5
Restaurants,"Solid Peruvian food place, my go-to when I'm hungover and need ""leche de tigre"". Great place and their seafood is as close as it gets in Montreal to the real deal back home!",4
Restaurants,"Had the Ceviche Camaron (shrimp) and the first beef and vegetables meat dish on the menu that the server recommended. Ceviche was decent but mostly onions and small for $25, and the other dish was basically cold soggy fries and red peppers with a small number of very chewy and very small bits of beef. I ate two bites and left it, only earring the side of rice with the ceviche. They discounted the $16 dish by $6. Ended up being over $40. Never again.",2
Restaurants,"Studzio is almost more of an art gallery than a restaurant, which is what it aims for in my opinion. It is without a doubt one of the more original and creative restaurants I've been to: the menus are hand-written by a local artist and presented on wood clipboards, the washroom walls are graffitied, instead of plates slabs of slate are used. 

The food itself is good, but not the best. For 42$, we had eggs benedict, an asparagus & bacon omelette, orange & grapefruit juice. All options come with a fruit salad (served in half a coconut), roasted potatoes, some fruit cake, and coffee. 

I would definitely come here again based on the decor and ambience alone. Go check it out!",4
Restaurants,"Stopped in here for a drink and a couple appetizers.  The salmon tartar was pretty good but the other salmon appetizer was just okay.  I had the mojito which was not bad, but not stellar either.",3
Restaurants,"This place was fun and tries very hard to please....but there are a few drawbacks and it falls short of many Montreal restaurants which easily get three stars. Most of the portions were way too small more suitable for people on diets. I ordered a salmon and shrimp main dish as part of the Tabledote, it was tasty and nicely presented on cool plate of black slate. Maybe there was one shrimp sliced in half and two or three bites of salmon on the skewer and that was it. Another skewer would have  satisfied. The beet and goat cheese salad was very light on the cheese about a teaspoon. My friends plates looked skimpy too with the exception of the steak frites. A glass of wine was included with the dinner but it had a few fruit flies floating in it. The server politely replaced it, but, the damage was already done.  In an attempt to be loungy and ""tres cool"" some housy/techno music was blasting everywhere making table conversation difficult. On the plus side it was a fun atmosphere and the presentation of the food was done creatively. It shouldn't take too much to bring this place to a much higher standard. So I wont return until it gets there.",2
Restaurants,Ok Italian food in the middle of Old Montreal.  Service was spotty but ok overall. Good place for kids. Bring your own bottle of wine.  Dinner was fine for a touristy place but  that price was not outrageous like the other restaurants nearby . . . just saying,3
Restaurants,"Surprisingly well-priced meals for a little restaurant in old montreal. Wouldn't rank it in the top for dining in old montreal since there are so many impressive restaurants around, but the food is quite good. Me and my friends love this restaurant because the meals are fairly cheap and its bring your own wine which saves a lot of money. Service is always great despite us being a bunch of uni kids. Also the menu satisfies everyone.",4
Restaurants,"Went to Giorgio's for a family reunion type lunch- there were 12 people, and understandably, larger parties take longer to serve....however, Giorgio's took an unbelievably long time for the food to come out to us. Not only did it take long, they brought out meals for 6 us, while the other 6 had to sit and wait another 30 minutes to receive their food. There is no excuse for this. 
Waitresses and staff were nice and polite and were apologetic (they blamed the cooks). However, nothing was compensated for the horrible experience we had there. And it took another 30 minutes to get the check.....who do they have to blame here? 

Food was alright... Descriptions of the menu items not available in English so it was VERY unclear on what the dishes actually contained. Had some unsatisfied family members on meals they expected and what they actually received. Prices very high for what the food. ($16 for a Caesar salad?!) 

We will NOT be returning to Giorgio's and I hope you will plan at least 2 hours if you plan to go there to eat....",1
Restaurants,Loved this place. It was very nice inside-delicious pizza and pasta. The wait staff was extremely nice. Byob though. Which is good for saving money! I got the mini margarita pizza and Caesar salad which was perfect. Highly suggest,4
Restaurants,"Ding ding ding, we have a winner here! At long last, an Indian restaurant that manages to marry good food, large-ish portions, and cheap prices with a clean, balanced airy atmosphere. 

The restaurant itself is breezy and has wood floors with tablecloths. The waitstaff is very friendly and jovial, and the food is really delicious, albeit predictable (all the usual suspects are on the menu, nothing really experimental). Portions are unusually large, bucking the trend of soupbowls full of sauce and maybe a piece of meat or two at most other Indian restaurants.

This has become my new go-to place for Indian, and that's saying a lot since I live around the corner from Dev and am 5 minutes from Jean Talon, a.k.a. Little Delhi, or whatever the euphemism is for Indiantown these days. Enjoy!",5
Restaurants,"Was in Montreal on vacation and was lucky enough to discover this gem on St. Laurent.

Expansive but comprehensive menu featuring all of the comfort foods you'd want from an Indian place.  Simple, comfortable decor...nothing fancy.  The star of the show is really the food, which was outstanding and reasonably priced.",5
Restaurants,"Can't believe this place wasn't packed to the rafters with people, as the food is of a very high quality and also reasonably priced.  It was a Sunday night though so that could explain why it was for the most part empty.  Always a good sign was that a decent number of people came in for takeout so I didn't feel bad that we were one of the only tables dining in.....

Couldn't say I didn't thoroughly enjoy ANY of the food that came out, although I do blame the chef for ruining the rest of my night, as I ate so much I just couldn't get back into party mode....

Try it out if you like Indian food and you'll be glad you did.",5
Restaurants,Absolutely fabulous. The combo classique is a great deal for two.,5
Restaurants,"What? Come on folks. Upscale interior does nothing to fix the food. Small, overpriced portions and not very good food. Butter chicken might as well have been a dessert dish with the amount of sugar used. If you're an carni/omnivore, just forget it. For vegetarians, however, the vegetable dishes were OK and far less expensive. 

As much as I want a great Indian place around Mile End, Jean-Talon still wins. That being said, even the portions up there are shrinking weekly. 

Rating Scale:
1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here.",2
Restaurants,"J'adore la cuisine indienne; c'est probablement une de mes préférées. Par contre, je suis critique quand j'en mange.

J'ai goûté la soupe dahl (très salée), les entrées variées (oignon baji, poulet tikka, samosa). Les bajis étaient plutôt tièdes. Le riz biryani à l'agneau était correct, mais sans plus. J'en cuisine un bien meilleur, sans me vanter! J'ai terminé le repas par un thé masala.

Le service était gentil et attentif. Dommage, ce n'est pas le meilleur restaurant indien en ville.",2
Restaurants,"Not all bad, the atmosphere here is fine for conversation with friends. It's the former location of Cinema/Café Lumière and they kept the place similar to what it used to be (at least according to my memories, it was like 15 years ago that I was there).

The food was just passable, all fairly bland. I had a lamb biryani which was the best plate although just average. The appetizers were bland and my wife's soup was very salty. Their only dessert option was a below average rice pudding.

So, try another place!",2
Restaurants,"If I looked at yelp reviews before deciding to eat at this restaurant, I probably would have decided not to go in. Luckily I didn't because I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered from the classic menu for 2, which came with enough food including starters, main meal, and dessert.

We started our meal with a choice of soup or salad. The salad was very basic with a delicious dressing, and the soup was lentil in chicken broth. I ordered the soup, but unfortunately it was not my favourite dish. Our meal came with 2 simosas, and 2 onion baji, which we split. The first simosa was chicken and the second was the traditional vegetable simosa. The simosa's were light and the dough was absolutely delicious. By far the best simosa dough I have ever eaten (I have been eating indian food at least twice per month for the last 2 years). The onion baji were also delicious, however they could have used a little more salt. 

Our main meals consisted of butter chicken, lamb bhuna and and a vegetable curry. The butter chicken was absolutely delicious and not at all ""too sweet"" as one other comment suggests. Being from Montreal, I have had butter chicken that tasted like it had lots of sugar in it and this one did not taste as sweet. The flavour and texture of the butter chicken was delicious, and the chicken was very tender and not at all dry. The lamb bhuna was also delicious. My only con for the two meat dishes would be the fact that I would have enjoyed a couple of more meat pieces in each. However, I must reiterate that by the end of the meal we definitely had enough food for 2 people. 

For desert, they brought us a delicious pudding with a passion fruit coulis. The desert was such a change from the typical gulab jamun or disgusting pressed coconut we seem to get at every other indian restaurant in Montreal. Above all else I couldn't help but notice how clean the restaurant was. It is by far the cleanest indian/asian restaurant I have ever been to. And the service was to die for. The wait staff was genuinely interested in how you enjoyed your meal, and is very thankful when you like it. In my case, the only thing I did not like was the soup. When the waiter noticed, he asked why I wasn't eating it. I told him it wasn't my favourite and he apologized profusely. 

The meal in total was under $50 before taxes for the both of us. I am surprised that this place isn't filled with people on a Saturday night, what a shame. Would definitely go there again. However, I do recommend that they reprint their menus (or at least replace the plastic cases they come in).",4
Restaurants,"I went there for lunch. Plates are big, food is okay. Price is fair. About 10-12 for soup, salad, rice, vegetables and dish. I would go there to eat once.",3
Restaurants,A definite notch above the average Montreal Indian restaurant. Food has a freshness and vibrancy. Spice arrangements have depth.,4
Restaurants,"Friends and I decided to try out an Indian restaurant closer to our place rather than trek up to the reliably tasty Bombay Mahal. Big mistake. The waiter seemed annoyed at our requests (e.g., an order of channa with our samosas) and got a few things wrong, even though we clarified in both English and Hindi. The sauces were bland and overly oily, the paneer was dry (almost hard, really) and strangely sweet, and most of the dishes tasted the same. The best thing was actually the plain basmati rice. Next time we'll be going back up to Jean-Talon, even in a snowstorm.",2
Restaurants,"Je suis allé dans ce restaurant car j'avais un coupon groupon et que j'apprécie beaucoup la cuisine indienne. 

Les plats y sont très bon et je n'ai rien de négatif a dire. 

L'ambiance est bonne, et j'ai passé un agréable moment en famille et ai très bien mangé. 

Le plus : nourriture HALAL !!!",4
Restaurants,"Went fit for lunch on a Wednesday.

Menu was restricted to a few choices, but prices were reasonable and service was timely.

I got to taste the chicken jalfrezi, tandoori and korma. All were tasty. The naan bread was also fresh and chewy.

Id have to try the full menu to make a fair comparison with other Indian restaurants in Montreal, but at the very least the food wasn't overly oily like I've often seen.

I would definitely go back given that an opportunity presents itself.",4
Restaurants,"Vraiment un très mauvais accueil. Nous avons acheté un Groupon pour faire l'essaie de ce restaurent et nous avons réservé 3 jours d'avance. A notre arrivée le dimanche à 20h, le restaurent etait vide et et on nous a refusé le repas car il y avait une limite de participation et ils nous ont dit qu'ils n'avaient pas notre réservation.

Le monsieur qui nous a répondu/pas servit, s'est dit être le gérant mais il était très très bête et pas arrangeant, surtout que je voulais du vin et une table d'hôte (qui ne sont pas comprit avec le Groupon)

Cest la dernière fois que nous allons y mettre les pieds et nous ne le recommande vraiment pas!",1
Restaurants,"I have eaten at dozens of Indian restaurants in five different countries and this is hands down the worst. Other reviewers may have had more luck with meat dishes but as vegetarians my wife and I were shocked at how little care was taken with our dishes. The korma and vindaloo had exactly the same random mixed vegetables with no respect for the vastly different nature of each curry. The vegetables included the standard potatoes but also, disgustingly, cabbage and corn.  The vindaloo was simply spicy with no character or complexity, and the korma was sweet enough to have been served as a dessert.  The dishes' appearance was frankly disgusting, a formless mush shining with grease. As we dined at prime time on a Saturday night the restaurant has no excuse for serving food that was so obviously far from fresh.  This dining experience  was so bad as to put me off one of my favorite cuisines for a long time to come.",1
Restaurants,"Les serveurs sont sympathiques et l'atmosphère est bonne,mais les caris ne sont pas aussi bien fait qu'à d'autre places sur St-Laurent. Le pain était bon mais les sauces manquent d'épices et goutent trop pareils. Peut être qu'on a mal commandé mais je pense que je préfère les autres places que j'ai essayé dans la ville.",2
Restaurants,"Food came after an hour and a half, despite the promise of it arriving in an hour. The naan bread was burned -- totally black. I asked them to come back and get it and the person on the phone very rudely said, ""Well then you can wait another two hours!"" Rude and incompetent. Don't bother.",1
Restaurants,"Quality authentic Tibetan food, and plenty of vegetarian options. The momos are fantastic! Although the fruit dessert is most likely delivered straight out of a can, it's very easy to overlook considering the overall experience.",5
Restaurants,"This was the first Tibetan restaurant in Montreal, long before the more popular Shambala. It's on Ontario Street not far from Quartier Latin and Cegep de Vieux Montreal.

While there usually is a stream of UQaM students here, the food is quite tasty, prices are low and the owner is a really nice guy. They even have a terrasse in the back open during the summer. Their steamed dumplings called Momos, are excellent and their cheese soup is probably the most amazing thing you can have on a cold winters day.

I have to warn you on the butter tea. Real butter tea in Tibet is make with yak's milk, and while I'm not sure if they use the real thing here or not, or maybe substitute with buttermilk, it is definitely an acquired taste. It tastes salty, buttery and milky all at the same time. I personally now enjoy it but it's not for everyone.",4
Restaurants,"On a warm Friday night I found myself with a group of friends wading through the crowd on St. Denis, we worked up an appetite but everything around us was packed, to make matters worse, one of the guys was a vegetarian.  I fired up Yelp for assistance and eventually we decided on Tibetan.  

Chez Gatse sounded promising with a long history and a location just off the main strip. I called to see if we could get a table, turns out the place was dead, which was the first hint that something was amiss. The owner, who was very nice and who took my call, already had a table set for us in the rather large terrace out the back of the restaurant.

The food was a big let down.  The bulk of the menu could be found in any of your average Chinese restaurants in Montreal.  I had one of the more Tibetan dishes ""Lhasa Chicken"" which was a chicken leg and thigh batter fried and then drenched in a brown gravy.  It was edible, but I wasn't impressed.  

I was expecting something different but instead I got mediocre Canadian Chinese food. Their one saving grace is they have a liquor license and a nice terrace.  Regardless I can't see myself going back, the food was forgettable.",2
Restaurants,"The food here is definitely unique. I enjoyed it, but I cannot comment on its authenticity. The butter tea is odd. I didn't dislike it, but I wouldn't drink it all the time. The momos were yummy, with the cheese one being my favorite. It was a little sweet. The beef ones were basically just like Chinese steamed dumplings. The service was good, and their menu is in both English and French. The server spoke both as well. They were friendly. I would eat here again.",3
Restaurants,"I've always had great meals here.

Great chicken, great momos, decent ambiance, friendly staff, cards accepted.

What more do you want?

It's cozy and feels so right for a meal on a winter night... Feels like you're in a cabin in the Himalayas

BTW They're open from 17h - 22h Mon - Sun",5
Restaurants,"This is a nice little cosy place off the busy St-Denis strip.
The owners are both from Tibet and very welcoming. You can find the usual Momos on the menu which is probably the most typical tibetan dish. 
I must admit that I went there with my mom, who has been to India and Nepal more times than I can count and enjoys Tibetan food wherever she goes, so I referred to her when it came to the tasting. 
We saw the lady in the kitchen going to the freezer to bring back a bag of frozen chinese dumplings which they passed as beef momos so it was not a nice start. The food was not bad, though I wouldn't say that it was good either. We had a few Momos which had not much taste whether they were beef or cheese or whatever. The lentil soup was good and the beef noodles (a tibetan special) not bad but nothing exciting that would make your mouth go ""Mmmmore""!",3
Restaurants,"New fav surpise find. Run by a Tibetan family, the place has cozy ambience and real nice food.  We were walking from Distillerie and found this place on the other side of the road. The inside is decorated with traditional Tibetan artifacts and Dalai lama posters. 

We started with Lentil Soup which is similar to lentil soup that you can find in turkish restaurants a lot like what we call daal in my country (Bangladesh). 

Then we tried the momo combination 3beef+1cheese. The cheese momo is huge! It's kinda sweet and doughy. I actually liked the beef momos better and probably would order only that next time. The chilli sauce with the momo was super hot and I simply loved that pairing. Fair warning: by hot, I mean wayyy hotter than the average Canadian taste palette. I am South Asian so I usually take my food very spicy.

For the main course I had Chicken Lhasa which is their recommended dish. I chose sweet bread as a side because the waiter (who's Tibetan) said that that's what they traditionally have. Tibetan Sweet bread is like the dough part of a momo with sandwhich bread-like texture on the inside. I loved my order but I would go with a side of rice next time, just because I am a more rice type person. The Chicken Lhasa was like a kind of curry. I loved every part of my meal.

My friends ordered the Shapta which was also a curry but a bit like Chinese curry. It has capsicum (pepper) in the mixture which contributes a different kind of flavour.

Most improtantly, the price here is unbeatable. Most main dishes are $9.99. So worth the experience. Strongly recommend this place.",4
Restaurants,"This is one of my favourite little restaurants in Montreal. It's tiny, intimate, and has a great menu! The staff is amazing.  It may be run by a family, but I'm not all together sure. Whether or not they are a family, they seem to treat their patrons like family. My grandparents used to eat here a lot a few years ago, but my grandfather does not like driving into the city. Last year I called for a reservation and they asked if it was for my grandparents. Even after a couple of years not going, they still remembered them. They are always pleasant, ready with great suggestions for both meal choices and wine pairing. They have delicious options on their menu and a reasonably priced and varied table d'hote. 

I would recommend this restaurant for a romantic intimate date or a very small group (2-5 max). It's a really tiny place so you might also want to make a reservation, especially if you're more than two people.",5
Restaurants,"I've been there quite a year ago, though it's only today that i've thought about it. 

Its a small 25-30 places restaurant that expand their business in Summer with a nice patio outside. The place is cozy, with some nice decoration. As soon as you enter the restaurant you don't feel that the sophisticated but simple, French Cuisine would alienate you with their complicated menu or really expensive à la carte Menu. No it's simple, no complication; a blackboard with today's menu. I remember having Veal Brain ; Cervelle de veau with some vegetable aside. It was quite good, I like the texture of veel brain, even though it's quite a no-no to lot of person it's pretty sophisticated meal. not too mushy or too cooked, well done! My friend had a steak and other friend got a goat cheese salad. The service is great, the restaurant feels like they have an established name and clients that come regularly. It's not really expensive for the place and the quality of the food. Ohh and the Bread is good! yeah!!!",4
Restaurants,"Food was o.k., nothing special; my escargot entree was lukewarm, the meat was chewy.  The waitress is very unfriendly and snotty, does not offer any suggestion as to what we should order.  Would not go back.",3
Restaurants,"Menu français classique un peu trop vaste,beaux vins,service courtois et competent,prix corrects.ce restaurant à déjà connu des jours meilleurs,mais garde une exellente réputation .",4
Restaurants,"First, let me start by praising the service. We had theatre tickets for 8 p.m. in the neighbourhood and, because of a big snowstorm, we were an hour later than planned for dinner. We walked in at 7:25 and they had our food sitting in front of us 5 minutes later. 

Unfortunately the food left a lot to be desired. Quantity was good and it was served piping hot, but even for a ""Québecois-style Asian"" resto, the food didn't taste remotely like we were expecting. I ordered a Thai-style curry (in coconut milk) and it tasted like it was flavoured with supermarket yellow curry powder mix. No coconut taste, no ginger/lemongrass/fish sauce/sweet salty spicy Thai goodness. My husband's chicken stir-fry had big strips of chicken, but it was that rubbery seasoned kind. 

We wanted to like this place, but we likely won't be back.",2
Restaurants,Ambiance et plats médiocres. Nos plats n'étaient pas très goûteux et les portions étaient plûtot petites. On avait encore faim en sortant  les quelques fois qu'on y suit allé.,3
Restaurants,"Excellent resto de quartier ""apportez votre vin"" que je fréquente depuis plusieurs années. Je prends presque toujours la même chose, le poisson au cary rouge dans lait de coco qui est excellent, épicé à souhait. Les légumes sont toujours très frais et les généreux morceaux de poisson sont parfaitement grillés, légèrement croustillants. Sinon la version tofu sur nouilles croustillantes est aussi succulente. Et maintenant que j'habite plus le quartier, je fais livrer. Je vous recommande!",5
Restaurants,"Restaurant de cuisine asiatique situé entre laurier et papineau. Offre un large menu diversifié avec grillades, nouilles, soupe, sautés... Idéal pour les familles. Service sympathique, on nous accueille toujours avec le sourire et les portions sont généreuses et je suis très satisfaite des plats que nous avons choisis!",4
Restaurants,"I couldn't leave Montreal without trying at least one french restaurant. My landlady recommended this place and we thought it was fantastic! It's such a shame for an awesome restaurant like this to have no reviews on Yelp. We opted for the rooftop seating since it was a cool night.  We started off with two glasses of Pinot Grigio and an Avocado Tartar, which was delicious. For entrees, we ordered a Lobster Risotto and the Lamb and we ended the night with a Profiteroles and Tarte Tatin. Presentation was fantastic for all the dishes and all the ingredients used were very fresh. My favorite has to be the lamb. The meat was so tender it fell off the bone immediately. The Lobster Risotto was a small portion but it was a little on the heavier side and was surprisingly filing. The profiteroles was amazing and the chocolate was very rich. Tarte Tatin (it's like an apple pie) was probably my least favorite (not because it was bad, but because it was not the taste I was expecting. I think they used a different kind of apple to make the filling). But nonetheless, the meal was fantastic and more people should know about it. 

FYI: All the menus in Montreal were in French, but our waiter was more than willing to translate literally the whole menu.",5
Restaurants,"Really good and tasty food! 
Fish soup waa die for! 
Lamb leg was tender and meat just fall of the bone. In Europe I ate differently cooked liver but never was impressed. Not this time! Veal liver was so-o tender and litle bit on rare side - cannot explain, you must try. 

Be prepared for little bit slow service... 

Highly recommend!",5
Restaurants,"Très belle découverte.  J'avais lu beaucoup de commentaires positifs sur l'endroit et tous se sont avérés justes.  Service très cordial, sympathique et attentionné.  L'ensemble du menu était très alléchant.  J'ai finalement opté pour le tartare de bison qui n'était pas au menu.  Excellent.  L'assaisonnement est juste.  Mon invitée était ravie de la bavette.  Une belle finale avec un succulent gâteau au fromage.  Les prix sont corrects et avec Accès Resto, le tout devient plus agréable.  On le recommande?  Chaleureusement.",4
Restaurants,"Comparativement à un autre restaurant français place Valois qui lui ressemble, l'expérience n'a pas été bonne. Par deux fois cet endroit m'a déçu. La première fois, un midi, plutôt bruyant au passage, où sur 3 convives, 2 avis mitigés, ça part mal. 
Nous souhaitons lui laisser une seconde chance, un soir de feux d'artifices où la carte propose le menu à ""seulement"" 33$ passé 22h (soit quand même 10$ de plus que l'autre adresse place Valois qui offre sa carte de soirée après 21h30). Nous commandons donc un plateau de fromages et une bouteille de vin pour accompagner. La serveuse nous conseille un vin qui ne s'accorde pas vraiment avec les fromages, et ceux-ci goûtent plus le chlore que le fromage. On en fait la remarque et demandons un autre choix car l'un des 4 n'est pas mangeable, la cuisinière fait transmettre à sa serveuse que c'est l'huile de truffes qui donne ce goût et refuse de nous le changer. Je ne tiens pas à m'obstiner, juste une totale déception, pour un restaurant français j'aurais préféré de bons fromages français plutôt que québécois d'une part, (Les spécialités québécoises sont disponibles et mieux choisies dans d'autres restaurants fameux à Montréal!) d'autre part les employés et/ou gérants de l'établissement sont très ""limites"".",3
Restaurants,I didn't even know this place existed. A friend told us about it and he wasn't wrong. We had the souvlaki sticks. The meat was grilled to perfection and super tender. potatoes were also very good. The tomatoes tasted like real tomatoes and not like the wet cardboard tomatoes available at this time of year. We are definitely going back.,4
Restaurants,"We discovered this place as we were biking up Parc to find a place to eat in Parc-X; it's in a strange location and we had never noticed it before.  We ordered eggplant spread and potato-garlic spread as appetizers; both were very fresh and tasted of excellent ingredients.  We then shared a salad of shredded romaine, escarole, green onion and dill with a vinaigrette; again it was very fresh and tasted of summer.  Finally, we had grilled lamb chops and a grilled half chicken; both were amazing, particularly the lamb which was from Quebec and was incredibly delicate and flavourful.  We are giving the restaurant five stars because it is such an excellent value -- everything was excellent quality and very well prepared and yet moderately priced.  The restaurant seems to be run by a greek family who are very friendly and welcoming; our waiter came over to actually get to know us and talked with us for a while.   They told us that it's often very busy Friday and Saturday night so it's best to reserve. We are definitely going back very soon!",5
Restaurants,One of my favourite restaurants in the city. The food is amazing and cooked to perfection. Family atmosphere with personalized service.  Ask for Vicky or Kosta.  Great family run restaurant.,5
Restaurants,"Love the #6 chicken yakisoba noodles.  It still taste fresh, good, and healthy for fast food.  I love cabbage in my stir fry.  They also have chicken curry.  I like the fact that they have a rice, noodle, and soup option. We love to come to the food court and mainly eat here.  There is free wifi here as well.  Cafeteria style too, if you love to people watch.  This is also underground/below the mall. Corners at St Catherine/McGill. Good food here overall.",5
Restaurants,"Doesn't taste like fast food, the food is delicious and very fresh and the boeuf yakissoba is amazing!",5
Restaurants,Good quality meats and friendly service.  The vegetables might be tastier but the variety and speed are nice to have.,4
Restaurants,My favorite restaurant in downtown Montreal! always fresh and tasty. been there thousand times!,5
Restaurants,"A mall food court stand that serves whole Red snapper? What?

But I guess this mall is no ordinary mall and this kiosk is no ordinary food court stand either. Among the thirty odd stands at Eaton, this is the only one that made me stop and consider. The woman at the counter gave me a sample of their breaded fillet and that sealed the deal. The fish was moist and tender, and the breading was very light and delicately seasoned. I almost couldn't believe I was eating fried fish.

They serve all their plates with a fountain drink and sides a la carte. I got roasted root vegetables and curried potatoes with coleslaw and beets. That woman seriously piled them on the plate, which itself was enormous. Then the line cook in the back laid four huge strips of fish on top. The total price came to be ~$12, and it could have fed a small family. The sides were great too. The curried potatoes were spicy and not mealy. The coleslaw was crispy and prepared with vinaigrette instead of mayonnaise.

It's not like it was the best seafood ever, but it definitely rivaled the fish and chips served at the many respectable Irish pubs I've been to. What a wonderful, delicious surprise!",5
Restaurants,"I'm on the edge about this restaurant. It is located in the food court in Eaton Center. I. Have eaten at the Aqua Lunch at Place Vertu in Saint-Laurent which is excellent. Better fish, better fries but about 20% more expensive. 

When the gentleman behind the counter took my order he asked what kind of salad I wanted as a side dish. Since I have never been offered salad at the Place Vertu franchise, I asked if they were owned by the same entity. I was informed that one had nothing to do with the other.

I ordered the fish and chips which includes a salad (I chose spinach and cabbage) and also a small soft drink. The cost without tip was $12.08 which is a pretty good value for the amount of food they serve you.

The fish itself were several small pieces of cod, slightly greasy, most of the batter being crispy but some soggy as well. The crispy parts were really good but the taste of the fish was lost in the batter. The fries were sub par. Nothing special. Not greasy but soggy. The spinach salad was great!

If the weather is good for a short walk without freezing or melting then there is a Brit and Fish on McGill street a short walk away which is probably the best fish and chips in the city. However, if you're craving fish and chips and don't want to take a short hike to get some then Aqua Lunch will suffice.

The establishment was very clean and the employees were exceptionally friendly.",3
Restaurants,"Tasty Italian food, small menu but has the essential all prepared nicely.  Owners were very welcoming and the service was good.  I'm just sad they did not have osso bucco the evening I went...",4
Restaurants,"Italian in Montreal - a must. La Capannina in Montreal - a must. The service...the food...the ambiance = superb. Came here over the Grand Prix weekend...ordered the Caesar salad to start (the dressing is phenomenal), the escargot (some of the best in Montreal), and has a pasta dish that left my mouth watering. I highly recommend coming here.",5
Restaurants,"Wow, incredible food and simple style. The gnocchi were soft and had full delicious potato flavor, the veal was tender... The carbonara was absolutely delightful. 

The service is slower than usual, but go with an expectation. You can tell it's a family run place, so take your time and enjoy! There is a lot of passion in that dish so don't rush it.",5
Restaurants,"Had a lovely lunch here. The special of the day, chicken cacciatore, was delicious. An extra few bucks provided a salad (which was tasty) and a great desert. Also the coffee is fantastic, the doppio was perfect.

Great service as well. I'm happy to have lucked out finding this place.",4
Restaurants,Excellent food and terrific experience.  A perfect small Italian restaurant feel.  The host made us feel like family and they accommodated special requests.,5
Restaurants,"The service and food were excellent! I had the veal scallopini and he had the cannelloni. We started with the calamari was delicious. We brought our 3.5 year old daughter, and the owner made a fuss and made her smile the whole night. It was a lovely experience!",5
Restaurants,"Went two nights in a row. Claude is such a delight. My coworker and I had two very long days of work and this place was highly recommended by another coworker and it's obvious why. The tortellini was delicious and the flourless chocolate cake was probably the best I've had, not too rich, just perfectly chocolatey. The second night I had the veal cannelloni which was great as well! Must end your meal with some cappuccino. Be sure to check out this place if your looking for some delicious Italian and exceptional service!",5
Restaurants,"Excellent service. Very tasty. Classical setting in a old house. Formal, but warm. Might be a bit overcooked for the veal chop",4
Restaurants,"The restaurant is in an old stone house and I love the ambiance.  The service is good and the prices are reasonable for what you get.  

The antipasti are quite big so it's definitely worthwhile splitting amongst two people.  The Caprese salad and arugula parmesan salad are good choices.  Both are very simple yet very tasty.  When it comes to the main course the rabbit is an excellent choice.  It's seasoned nicely and very moist.

Their tiramisu is excellent here.  I find a lot of places drizzle the alcohol over the ladyfingers making it overpowering.  If it's worked into the mascarpone mixture then it doesn't drown out the other flavours.  My guess is that they do the latter because there's a nice delicate balance of flavour in the tiramisu.

Overall it's an excellent restaurant and it's definitely worth the trip.",5
Restaurants,"Amazing restaurant!!  Set up in a beautiful house in TMR,  the staff are super friendly and the food is great.  They also offer gelato in the summer,  you should definitely try.  What's amazing about the place is that the chef goes out of his way to pick the best ingredients for every meal.  You will always find what's in season and all at a reasonable price.",5
Restaurants,I personnaly went in the kitchen to thank and see the chef of my filet Mignon. I have never experienced such a thing before. He made me get up from my seat to see him and just praise him on how delicious his sauce on the filet was. I would hire him to cater for my wedding if I could!! This is an amazing chef from Italy . This restaurant is a hidden treasure! I will always come back to see Armando!! Wow! Just Wow!,5
Restaurants,"Not sure if this is the right location, I went to the one at the Bell Centre. In summary - slow service, 16 VTT  wings are equivalent to about 6 normal sized wings...at least they got the beer right. Maybe the place is better during game night....",1
Restaurants,"Does lean on the restaurant side of the sports based restaurant/sports bar scale. Food is not cheap but pretty damn good. Just a colossal amount of screens, most tuned to RDS. They are a little reluctant to kick the sound over to a game unless the Habs are playing, and when they do there is a very annoying delay between the video and the audio signal. 

Still, I went there about three months ago to watch the Barca/Gunners CL match and the game was on with the audio, and it was fairly pleasant. There were only about 8 people around the bar watching the game, which indicated I probably picked the wrong place to watch football, but the bartender was nice and closed the blinds which glared the screen a little bit.

Walked past it as the Habs game was starting. Good god. I imagine it is harder to fit into than the actual Bell Centre. That was the night of Pacioretty hit; I feared for the few Boston fans that actually decided to watch the game there.",3
Restaurants,Great place to drink some ale and watch Les Habitants!  Wings looked good too... I didn't try them because we were full from one of the delicious french bistro's in town.,4
Restaurants,"The Cage aux Sports is to Quebec - what Hooters is to the Southern US. They are everywhere, the menu is the same and they are boring.

I had gone for lunch and wanted to order the hot-chicken sandwich. Was politely told by the waitress that they didn't have any bread to make the sandwich. HUH? I'm no chef, but when I suggested that they substitute it for a hamburger bun and that I would be happy with that - she said the cook won't want to switch.

So I ordered a burger because they had a new menu with some ""specialty"" burgers. The patty was not fresh - it was the variety that you take from the freezer. Probably with grill marks already produced on them. It was not an enjoyable meal. 

A friend of mine had the grilled chicken wrap - commented that it was alright also.

Another friend of mine had the roasted chicken breast - said it was great, nice and moist chicken.

Just goes to prove to you - stick with the old.",2

Prices are a little higher than most of the other pubs in town, but it's a good place to go before a game.",3

When the waitress (finally) came by to ask how everything was, I asked her if there was supposed to be bacon and she simply said ""yes it's small"".. it was just lackluster service and food quality.

It's a get-what-you-pay-for experience, I guess. It's close to the Bell Centre, but so are other places that will have better food and service. The only thing I really liked was that you can have free popcorn... that's pretty fun :)",2
Restaurants,"It's a sports bar, but that doesn't mean the staff have to be half-a**ed and not give a s**t.

Our server was rude right up to the point where my girlfriend spoke French. It's Montreal, don't pretend like this is the first time you've had people speaking English. This is located in a touristy area (Bell Centre, Train Station nearby...).

The nachos are supposed to have bacon on them. Ours didn't seem to have any, so we asked. We shouldn't have bothered asking - we were treated like idiots for asking. We eventually found a few crumbs of bacon. Don't describe the dish on the menu with bacon then have brush us off because we couldn't find any.

Scratch that - we found two chips with hints of bacon.

Thanks for the free popcorn...that was the highlight. 

Again, this is just a sports bar and not a good one. Go elsewhere. This place gets business because it is a chain and has a notable name. 

I guess the beer was cold...they got that right.",1

Restaurants,"Wandered in here on a Sunday night with two Tweens to watch the World Cup Finals. The place was practically empty. We told the hostess we were there to see the game and she positioned our table so we could see the biggest screen they had. Perfect!  Knowing we would be taking up a table for awhile, we ordered appetizers of poutine and nachos. She told us that their poutine was tasty, but that we should try more authentic poutine before leaving town. We appreciated her advice, but the poutine we were served tasted just fine. Nachos were tasty too, but different than we were expecting. Real cheese was melted on making many chips dry... But there was a sour cream sauce we poured on ourselves that helped. We were happy to see the game and drink bottomless sodas.. So it was great. Ordered dinner at half time....buffalo chicken sandwich for me, burger for hubby, and kids meals for the kids. I thought my sandwich was fresh and well seasoned and the burger was good too. 

All in all.. A very pleasant evening that ended in victory for our team! Prices were a bit in the high side, but about what we expected at a chain in the city. A fun evening!",5
Restaurants,Enjoyed the lunch and beer.  Would recommend if staying at the Nouvel Hotel.  It is walking distance.,4
Restaurants,"Pros: Great sports bar. Tons of TV's. Cute waitresses. Attached to Holiday Inn. 
Cons: The wings are the smallest i've ever seen.",4
Restaurants,"One of the first Indian restaurants I have ever eaten at. Actually I think it might of been the first. I don't know if that disqualifies me from being a half decent critic. But I have eaten tonnes of Indian food since, and this place just didn't cut it. The food was bland, uninspired, and presented in a sloppy fashion. Granted it is Indian food, but I believe that Indian unfairly gets a bad rap for being mishmash food. I think this place gets away with serving sub par Indian food, I do not recommend it.",2
Restaurants,"I have to agree with the first reviewer, very disappointing.  If you want better Indian food at an amazing price, I would have to recommend Thali on the corner of St-Marc and St-Catherine a block away.",1
Restaurants,"One star (no pun intended) just to be polite. The worst expensive Indian food I have ever had. Had the chicken korma, it was bland and on the cold side. Would not go back.",1
Restaurants,"Not sure what was going when the Montreal Mirror wrote that review of Star of India but something must have changed. Their food was marginal.... and that's talking about the best dish I had. 

I think what really took the cake was when I had an order of chapati (for $1.50) and only 1 came. What's with that?! It's like buying a bag of chips only to find out that there are only a few in the entire bag..... 

It's like an electronic toy given without the batteries on Christmas...

I mean if this chapati had been made with golden, mythical, Elysian wheat then maybe the price would have been justified...

Ok i'm done. Star of India, like your name implies, only 1 star for you.",1
Restaurants,"So after stopping here for dinner while vacationing in Montreal, I was really surprised it had such a low star rating on yelp. I think that some of the older reviews are out of date - b/c this place was really good!! The staff was super nice, and the food was delicious! I had a vegetarian sampler plate, which was a ton of food for an awesome price. The chef's fruit sauce that came with the samosas was so good! I wish he bottled that stuff for sale. The garlic naan was also great, and my boyfriend said the lamb curry was amazing. They gave us both a dessert at the end of dinner, which I can only describe as something similar to a donut hole soaked in a delicious sugar syrup - yum. I would definitely recommend this place!",4
Restaurants,"This place looks like it has had numerous health-code violations and the food is extremely overpriced, meals do not include rice or naan and the dish I had was extremely bland and possibly older than it should've been. Not to mention the service was rather on the pompous side.",1
Restaurants,"This restaurant is good, i haven't tried all the indian restaurants in Montreal but the food was good and the service excellent. I taste the curry fish and it was very good, all my friends like their meals. You should try it !

Ce restaurant est pas mal bon, je n'ai pas essayé tous les resto indiens à Montréal mais j'ai bien aimé mon poisson curry juste assez épicé. Tous mes amis ont bien aimés leurs repas. 

Vous devriez l'essayer !",4
Restaurants,The service was really good but the food was quite tasteless. We ordered a few different curries and they were all very similar tasting which was a bit of a shame. The food isn't awful but nothing spectacular and I wouldn't go back.,3
Restaurants,"I found Star of India to be alright. Nothing overly wrong with this restaurant from what I experienced.

When I came in, I got served immediately and the waiters were pretty quick to take my orders and check up on me which I like. The butter chicken on their menu tastes and same with the chapati bread. I found the prices here to be somewhat reasonable and the decor of this place was kinda East Indian like, which is expected.

Overall, I found this restaurant to be good and could be worth a second visit but then again, I'm not the biggest fan of Indian fan, just occasionally.

FINAL GRADE: B",3
Restaurants,I don't eat Indian food that often so I don't really know what is good 'good'. I ordered the beef curry and buttered chicken and it was okay but not memorable. Rice or naan not included! :( The kebab appetizer wasn't that great (dry and expensive) overall soso.,3
Restaurants,"I didn't know what to expect here, so with no expectations, this place wasn't too shabby. It wasn't spectacular however either.

The chicken liver appetizer was delicious (especially if you don't like the taste of liver), while the mango lassi was pretty good. We ordered the lamb and chicken spiced up, and it was delivered as such. The naan was buttered, not dry and not burnt to a crisp. The daal soup is rather decent too.

Service time here is lengthy, and at busy times, I can imagine being here quite a while. It takes them ten minutes to prepare an iced tea, which has enough sugar to give someone diabetes. That said, and even with the wait time, we were done and out in just over an hour. Not a bad place to check out.",3
Restaurants,So far this is the best indian restaurant I've ever been to. Others always disappoint me but this one knows how to deliver good food with proper service. would eat again 10/10,5
Restaurants,"Mon restaurent préféré par excellence! Tout y est tout simplement savoureux. Le Naan est fait avec des graines de carvi, ce qui le rend encore plus goûteux et le riz avec des fleurs de safran. Pas besoin d'aller à Parc-Ex pour se faire un bon repas indien",5
Restaurants,"""Words cannot describe the amount of anguish and sorrow that this company has caused me in a short yet long period of time. FIRSTLY, upon ordering, we were told that they did not accept debit, a bold faced lie as as soon as we told them we did not have cash, they quickly said that they accept debit (DO NOT FALL FOR THIS TRAP!!!). SECONDLY, we were promised that the order would take about 30 minutes, another bold faced lie. The order took about an hour and a half to deliver. In this hour and a half we were called THREE TIMES by a man who most certainly had just awoken from a 30 year coma and could not find a simple house. 0/10."" - Daniel

""Food was good. 4/5."" - Josh 

""Infinity/5. So good. I ate till my belly became distended, then ruptured, sending packets of curry everywhere, didn't care, ate that slop off the floor, still very good."" - Drake

""Nice. 4/5."" - Rachel",4
Restaurants,"Greaat service, very friendly lot, I wish the food was as great as the service. It was Ok indian food, not awful, but not great, and it was not that spicy, which was disappointing",3
Restaurants,"This place is pretty good, and their service is great. I've been here a few times, and I feel that the quality of the naan has dropped a bit, but the food is actually quite good, and very flavorful. The can really increase the spice level if you request it!

The quality is not too bad either, however, their meat portions aren't very hearty, however their service is amazing! The servers are very attentive.

It can get a bit pricey, even for a modest outing though (about $20-35 per person), but good place to check out.",3
Restaurants,"Food poisoning on Valentine's Day. 

This place cost me $20 for tasteless food and then an extra $180 night at a hotel. Yes, throwing up violently and spending an extra day in a city I'm visiting bedridden is exactly my idea of a super fun time. I would recommend you never go here, ever, unless you find Russian roulette enjoyable!",1
Restaurants,"The staff was good, but the food was horrible.. Had butter chicken but it was sugary, the naan doesnt seem like its made in house, and the samosas were nothing exciting.

Ive had indian food at all sorts of places in Montreal, Toronto, England, and even India. Go somewhere else if you are craving butter chicken.",2
Restaurants,"Excellent, on est allé par hasard et on a adoré! Le service est super bon et on a vraiment bien mangé! Une petite place à ne pas manquer",5
Restaurants,Food was horrible. Totally not worth the price. Nothing was good apart from the pakoras.,1
Restaurants,"The owner is super nice!!!!!!!! The food is wonderful~ Love it. Hope i can go there again. BTW, I had bean curd knife sliced noodle.",5
Restaurants,"This was a big surprise! It's hidden on St-Marc street, north of de Maisonneuve, in the residential buidings of the sector. It seems to be a 'crappy' place by its look, but DAMN, those wonton and dumplings...AWESOME! My tastebuds were going crazy: I never tasted good, home-made wontons that tasted something else than paper or bland! And the home-made sweet cookies were received, at no extra cost....miam! I still salivating when I'm thinking about those. And the customer service was friendly, too.
Definitely a place I'll go back A LOT when I'm downtown!",5
Restaurants,"One of my favourite hidden gems. Mommas hand made noodles, I suggest home style beef or one of their soups. Payment is cash but you will smile as you close your bill.

Food:  9/10
Service:  8/10 - missing utensils, delayed service made me miss happy hour
Price:  7/10
Atmosphere:  7/10 - TVs had nothing on, could of at least had the hockey game on mute",5
Restaurants,"One of my favourite places to eat on a budget at this family restaurant. Cheap, good and homemade. 

You'll often see the grandmother chopping broccoli of cauliflower on her lap with a cleaver. Quite interesting to watch.

Everything on the menu is a hit, although the homemade wonton soup with noodles is what keeps me coming back.",5
Restaurants,"Simple but tasty. The staff are incredibly friendly and the vegetables are always fresh. They make their noodles from scratch and have three different options for the way they prepare tofu. Really nice, calm atmosphere. Also very affordable! One of my favourite downtown spots.",4
Restaurants,Very good taiwanese food and the lady is always very friendly. I love their beef noodles soup. The service might be slow compared to other restaurant but they made almost every dish upon order. Don't go there if you are in rush. I also loved their home cookies. The price is more than reasonable.,5
Restaurants,"There isn't very many taiwanese restaurants in town and this one is my favorite restaurant to go to. Even though they don't have bubble tea ( like typical taiwanese snack places do), the food there is like a slow home cooked meal. From first entering the door, you get the welcoming by this very nice Asian lady that smiles all the time! 

Don't get me started with the food, the food here is amazing. They have a good chicken leg on rice, beef noodle soup and many others that I have tried. 

If you're in a rush to get a quick dinner, this is not the place to be. They really do take the time to cook your meal really well. It's a family owned business and I recommend everyone get to know the people who work at the restaurant. They are genuinely nice people! 
Options to pay include cash and debit. The tip option is automatic of 50 cents. Anyone who does end up paying debit, I recommend you have cash cause she'll say that 50 cents is enough tip.",5
Restaurants,"I came in because my belly was begging  for a wonton soup to ward off the cold. I sort of got overwhelmed by the wall menu and ordered a noodle in roasted chicken thigh soup instead.
What I GOT was actually a bowl of hot soup and noodles perfumed with coriander and generously festooned with bite-sized chunks of crunchy lettuce.  Annnnnd... a side of the umami-est roasted leg and thigh of chicken that I've tasted in months. 
Plus tea.
Plus cookies.

All for $10.00. Crazy!!

So, for a little hole in the wall and admittedly tired looking restaurant,  you can expect excellent value for your lunch dollar.",4
Restaurants,"Great Restaurant, Amazing prices, great staff!!

This is an excellent hole in the wall restaurant. I am going to preface this review by saying that if you want excellent food, but dont care about the ambiance, then this is the place for you. If however you are trying to impress someone, or looking for a more fancy deco type place, this isn't it. It is a no frills asian restaurant where the focus is on the food, and not on the decoration

Overall, the food was excellent, with VERY affordable prices. 
I got the hot and sour soup which was delicious, filled with lots of tofu and quite flavourful ($3.99). My friend got the homestyle noodles, which was a large portion of noodles with minced port and vegetables ($7.99). The food was delicious, and NOT GREASY which is rare for many asian places. We were there for a while, and whatever came out of the kitchen just looked delicious. 

The service was also excellent. It is a family run operation, and the cute lade (sister-in law of the owner) was super friendly and helpful when ordering. She was also quite good about refilling the tea and whatnot. 

I would definitely return to try the other stuff

Summary: 
  Food 5/5
  Service 5/5
  Decorations 3/5",5
Restaurants,"Love this place, very friendly women that runs it, always saying xie xie (thank you). They make home made noodles and dumplings. Noodles are some of the best Ive ever had, thick and chewy just how I like it. My favourite dishes are Twice cooked chicken or pork with noodles, Won ton noodle soup, Coriander chicken with noodles and they make a nice taiwanese pancake. Prices are good as well. Highly recommend",5
Restaurants,They were very sweet but we got three dishes and none of them were good. The beef dishes tasted really hamburger-y. Dumplings with peanut sauce are always good but not here.,2
Restaurants,"The positives: the food is cheap and good, the ladies working there are nice/friendly. However there is no air conditioning or fans so on a hot and humid summer day it's unbearable in the restaurant. 

I got the G - wonton soup with noodles (c$8.99). Portion size was ample. Noodles appear to be hand pulled in house. Soup broth taste was OK but nothing special. The wontons were different but delicious. They are definitely homemade and lool more like dumplings than wontons, which is fine. Also there seemed to be 6-8 of them in my bowl which is ample in my opinion.  I debated if I should get just the wonton soup for c$4.99 (w/o noodles). Probably should have gotten it since the noodles were not worth the additional c$4. Also there is American green kale in the noodles - never seen that before. 

Service is slow given limited number of workers.",3
Restaurants,"Trattoria Trestevere is by far one of the best Italian restaurants in Montreal located conveniently downtown.

My family has been going here for years. It is our go to for a celebratory meal. The salads and minestrone are delicious, as are all of the pasta dishes and desserts (tiramisu and tartufo). 

I highly recommend it!!",5
Restaurants,"This is a great family restaurant - a little quiet sanity in the craziness of Crescent St. in Montreal.  This place really feels like a legit small family Italian place.  I kept it simple - an antipasti plate and pasta with marinara sauce, plus a glass of House red wine.

The antipasti plate was exactly what I expected.  Very good.  The fresh tomato was *really* good.  Just a bite, but now in August, it was everything a good tomato should be, and did not taste like an industrial product (sad joke, given just how bad grocery store tomatoes in the U.S. are these days).  The mozzarella went with it very well.

The bread was a bit of a disappointment - it would have been great to have some really fresh bread, but it was okay.

The pasta and sauce was just fine, with fresh grated parmigiana cheese and fresh cracked pepper on top.  Just the way I like it.   I go for the simple straight forward dishes.  If they can get these right, then the more complex stuff is usually good as well.  Again, the sauce was great, and the pasta was cooked just right.

So I would suggest this place if you are looking for a good place in Montreal with that family-run Italian feeling.

BTW, I looked at the selection of wines and it looked great.",4
Restaurants,Traditional italian restaurant in the heart of downtown!,5
Restaurants,"Love this little Italian restaurant! After walking the city all day we were tired and starving. The comfy, home-style Italian food from this place was just what we needed! The waiter said that they stay open for as long as people come in, so it's a great place for a late night bite!",4
Restaurants,Cozy and romantic atmosphere. Fancier but still reasonably priced. Really enjoyed the food.,4
Restaurants,"Gord and I had supper tonight at Trattoria Trestevere.

Avelino brought us some appies ... the bruschetta was delicious.  He also brought us some warm rolls ... they were soft on the inside and crusty on the outside.

Gord started with a Caesar's Salad and he said it was the best Caesar's Salad he's ever had.

Gord ordered Spaghetti carbonara and said it was delicious.  He liked that the pasta was fresh and he said the sauce was good.  He'd get it again.

I ordered Lasagna al forno and it too was delicious.  The pasta was fresh and it was a large portion.  Yum!

After our meal, Avelino brought us a bowl of walnuts and nectarines.  Alas, we were too full to enjoy them.

I mentioned that Gord's birthday was tomorrow and Avelino bought him a piece of cake.  I just had a couple bites and it was good ... it seemed to be soaked in booze and the icing was creamy.

If you want traditional Italian food, you should check it out!",5
Restaurants,We had dinner here on a recent visit to Montreal. Food was very good overall a little salty. Pasta and sauce were fresh we had the chicken fettuccini and veal parmesan . The place doesn't look like much from the outside but it's got a cozy feeling to it inside. At the end of your meal you get a bowl of walnuts and clementines which was a nice touch :) overall it was good!,4
Restaurants,"Urgh! This is a frustrating review to write because I think that I made the fatal error of just ordering the wrong things. You know when you look around and you think, ""Wait a sec...all of their food looks really good...why does my food not look like that?""

So I'm gonna give it another try, and will update if necessary.

Here's the deal...we both ordered off the table d'hôte. And it really was not worth it, in my opinion, for the tiny salad and kind of average dessert that you spend about ten extra bucks for. (Also, you gotta gimme a heads up if all your desserts are soaked in alcohol. Homie don't play that.)

I don't quite recall our choices, but I do recall that they were almost entirely composed of cheese, upon cheese, upon cheese. And not much else. I get it Italian food has cheese. But not that much. I will say, it was quality, not your random shredded pizza mozz. But it was just overwhelming. 

The service was great though. And I liked the ambiance pretty well.",3
Restaurants,"Last time I visited this wonderful restaurant was way back in 1992. Alberto and Guido always greeted me with the warmest smiles and hospitality.  I cannot believe this trattoria is still amazing.  Warm atmosphere, delicious home style food that you simply cannot go wrong with.  It's not just a restaurant to me where I can have heartwarming food that nourishes my soul, but an old friend you can rely on who is unpretentious and stable.  Can't wait to come back.",5
Restaurants,Not sure why this restaurant got so many good stars. Our service was normal and the food was not that great. I personally would not come back here the final kicker is when we got the bill and notice how outrageously priced it was. Thanks for nothing,2
Restaurants,"As a tourist, Brasserie Capri is not in the usual path of interests.  However, if you're reading this, you're probably interested in Quebec pork knuckles and you're probably thinking about going out of the way for it.  It's not actually a knuckle, but the shank portion above the foot.  It's braised in a slightly sour brine for hours until it's pretty much falling apart.  What you get is a lump that would have you wondering if you do have some cannibalistic tendencies, some boiled potatoes and kraut.

It is the most porky meal I've ever had.  It just exudes the robust flavor of the pig, the smell of cooked swine just radiates in all directions.  You navigate through gelatinous skin and fat to softened meat with simply a fork.  Gobs and gobs of pork fat and meat, tinged with a slight sourness of vinegar.  Bonus:  Suck that marrow out of the bone.  Glorious.",4
Restaurants,Apparently you can't order things the way you want them here... some of our group tried to order poutine without the extremely cat-food looking beef...they were told they couldnt. Someone else tried to order vegetarian nachos and they came with bacon... The beer is cheap at least.,2
Restaurants,"Brasserie Capri seem's to be one of those hidden ""locals only"" places. We went with a small group of people on Sunday evening, they were clearly understaffed but apologetic for the slow service. The menu likely hasn't changed much over time - but they do know how to make the pork nuckle. One person called it French 'soul food'. Unless you're a regular, this is one of those places that you need to go to without expectations for speedy service, when she came, the waitress was friendly and supportive of our poor French.",3
Restaurants,"No English spoken. Pig knuckles is insane. Delicious. With sauerkraut and boiled potatoes. Clearly a neighborhood bar. Old men drinking cheap wine. 

Close to burgundy lion, combine the 2.",5
Restaurants,Service was good. Food was okay. It is what it is. But one thing I did not like about this place. they charge you 2.75$ for a can coke. We ordered a hamburger which was okay. pontine I really liked. It's  mostly a bar then I restaurant. Plenty of TVs to watch sports. But if you go here just to eat. forget about it. but to go here have a couple beers with the guys to watch a hockey game then it's not bad place. Unfortunately we came to eat. And got ripped off by the soft drinks again 2.75$ for a can Coke. But that was my fault they gave you free popcorn and you know the trick. salty popcorn makes you drink lol,2
Restaurants,"I've wanted to visit this place ever since I  saw Anthony Bourdain travel & food show Montreal episode. I must say I was a  bit skeptical at first on whether it is as good as it looks on TV, but my love for pork knuckles overcame any doubts I've had.

This place is full of simplicity and old traditions, it's a pub with a local diner atmosphere and an outside terrace. It's perfect for a quick bite to eat and to have some delicious food and drinks with your friends. It's very local, most of the regular customers are older gentlemen and some couples, but then again it was on weekday afternoon, so it's possible the crowd is different during the weekends.

Nevertheless, I fell in love with the place. The service was impeccable and quick, the atmosphere was warm, full of smiles and jokes and recommendations from other customers and regulars. The pork knuckle was simply delightful! I love hearty simple foods and this place was more than perfect for ""no occasion late lunch"". 

I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to meet with friends, have some 'home-style hearty food' which can be heavy on a stomach (if you eat as much as I did) but easy on your wallet (the bill was also a pleasant surprise).",5
Restaurants,"Classic ""Tavern"" style brasserie.  Tucked away next to new (repurposed industrial) residential condo developments along the Lachine Canal.  It's mostly frequented by locals.  Had a great lunch!  Hamburger Steak with Pepper Sauce & fries & steamed veg.   Friend had the Pigs Knuckles and they just don't come any better than here at the Capri.  French is the principal language. 

Cold beer was perfect.  Manon was our server and she is terrific,  bilingual, professional and friendly.  Bon appetit!!",4
Restaurants,"This little lebanese cuisine restaurant is a true gem! 

Order the Machawi platter which is composed of 3 different meat, rice, salad!! I personally like the shashlik!

Best of all, bring your own wine!

Service is wonderful! Azar and his family puts so much work and effort. The best!",5
Restaurants,"Really tasty, good quality Lebanese food. And BYOW. A little on the pricey side, ~$35 per person without alcohol, but we had a good night.

It's a family business, and they're all working together well. The man managing the store front was really friendly, and not in an annoying way like some places. It was nice.

However, certain aspects left something to be desired - a slight emptiness that I can't put my finger on. That said, that could be also just be my own bias, because I grew up in the Middle East, and am not used to this type of otherwise reasonably priced food being marketed as something exotic and expensive.

But if you want Lebanese with some nice wine, it's a good spot.",3
Restaurants,"C'était vraiment délicieux! Et le couple qui tient l'endroit était très cordial et soucieux de nous savoir satisfaits 
On a partagé les assiettes de mashawi fruits de mer et viandes, c'était frais, varié, plein de goût. Ayant été très déçue de La Sirène (autre resto libanais à Montréal) par le passé, j'ai été agréablement surprise de découvrir cette petite perle où je reviendrai bientôt avec plaisir. En plus, c'est un BYOB, ce que j'adore.
Mini critique: J'aurais personnellement cuit le boeuf un peu moins et assaisonné le hommous d'un petit peu plus de citron. 
Mais sinon MIAM!
Bref, je vous recommande Azar chaudement.",5
Restaurants,"The most AUTHENTIC Lebanese restaurant in Montreal! 
The family that runs the place is very accommodating and friendly.
The food is amazing and fresh. 
Another thing that was outstanding was the service. 
Keep up the good work!",5
Restaurants,"Howdy!

Nice, solid Lebanese food. Large portions, reasonably priced. Unfortunately stuck in a horribly inconvenient location if you are car-less. On the other hand, if you live in ville Saint Laurent this should be your go to place for Baba ghanoush and grilled meats.",3
Restaurants,Amazing authentic Lebanese food and great service. It is a tragedy that more people don't know about this place. Please go eat there you won't be disappointed. Try the seafood platter and the fatouche salad!,5
Restaurants,"Wonderful authentic Lebanese food and heavenly sweets! Every single bite was a delight, perfectly seasoned, and the portions were the right size! The sweets are simply perfect, well structured and balanced, pure gastronomic joy! One of the most beautiful meals I ever had, complete and very reasonably priced! The service is great, and the the atmosphere is so pleasant and warm! Highly recommended!
Congratulations to the owners! Bon appetite everyone!",5
Restaurants,"Very dissapointing experience! I was invited for a Baptism & I got there at 4pm the food only came an hour & a half later. For the number of guests per table there wasn't enough food & the taste was not that great. I am Lebanese & know very well leabanese food, my taste buds were unsatisfied! It is an overated resto",1
Restaurants,This is the place for Lebanese food. Always fresh and tasty. Always great service. Nice modern interior design.,5
Restaurants,"I ate lunch at this restaurant yesterday and was surprised how nice it was inside.  I expected more of a chain-looking type place.

The food was pretty good, although it's tough to find something that stands out when you just order pizza...as far as the pizza's go though, right up there with the best of 'em for those flat stone oven type pizza.

Service was good as well.  I would go for lunch again, or take clients, but probably not go personally as there are many other choices that are more unique.",3
Restaurants,"Had lunch here today. The restaurant looks expensive from the outside, so I was pleasantly surprised at how affordable it is. I had a vitello Roma from the lunch menu which included a Cesar salad. The salad was a good, typical Cesar for an Italian restaurant. The veal was outstanding. The sauce was perfect and the peppers and mushrooms added a lot of flavor. I had it with fettuccine which was cooked perfectly. I'm glad I finally gave this place a chance.",5
Restaurants,"Went there for a group of friends to celebrate a birthday and it was ok but nothing memorable. 

The place is huge and it was quite busy so it was very loud because they had a live group playing at your table. The service was very slow and the waitress came many time to apologies and explain that the kitchen was backed up.

The menu is big but nothing really stood out to me. So I ordered pasta and mussel and it was good but again not amazing.

I would maybe go there again if I am in the area but wouldn't go out of my way just to go there.",2
Restaurants,"Hanging with friends here to avoid traffic.

Service is good. Xmas decorations cute. Environment is good for having a discussion. Soup really too salty, they changed it to another type of soup for me :)",3
Restaurants,Nourriture très acceptable pour ce genre d'établissements (franchise). Service bien mais rien d'exceptionnel.,3
Restaurants,"Nice environment, friendly service! No wifi :-(

Being an Anglophone in Montreal can sometimes be a challenge at some restaurants. Depending on how willing the server is to communicate in English, you could get the perception of poor service. I would have to say from my experience that Roxanne is an excellent waitress.

They have a prix fixe option for lunch which includes a choice of soup or salad, a main for under $20. The veal parmigiana was good, as was the minestrone soup. It's hard to tell whether there was too much salt in the food as it tasted fine.

Upstairs they have a banquet type seating for 30-50 people. I gather they host large crowds upstairs. The upstairs and washrooms appeared fine to me so I'm not sure what the other reviews found so disgusting.",3
Restaurants,"Just like Bruno L. said, TV dinner #17 is a can't go wrong selection and it's only $7.95 with free delivery!  It's not the most amazing chinese food you've ever had but it's huge and cheap and more than half decent!   General Tao chicken is a heaping portion of large slices of general tao chicken with a tasty/tangy not overly spicy sauce - one of the better versions of general tao chicken that I've had in my lifetime.

TV Dinners are between $6.95-$7.95 come with a huge container of chicken fried rice, a delicious egg roll,  and a little side container of dipping sauce.  It's a realliy great value, and delivery was suuuper fast and friendly! Open til 11pm -  I will definitely be ordering from these guys again.

P.S. The wonton soup is really flavourful too!",4
Restaurants,"Okay so after writing my first review I revisited this restaurant a few times for take out/delivery and I have to update the original to include the following disclaimer:

What it says on the menu is not necessarily what you will receive.

I guess the definition of ""chinese"" food varies by region but having basically grown up in Chinatown Toronto, I  have a decent grasp of what's what on a chinese restaurant menu.  That being said, I ordered delivery of ""pork chow mein"" and received ""pork fried rice"".  I called to report the error and they said if I wanted the chow mein they'd send it right out but I'd have to return the ""pork fried rice"".  We found this little bit annoying because the rest of our food had arrived and was still hot and we wanted to get started, but we agreed.  We then waited 30 mins for the chow mein to arrive and make the exchange, at which point the rest of the food was cold.  

When the replacement did arrive, it was not ""pork chow mein"" but ""pork chop suey"".  I called back again to let her know of the 2nd mistake, this time they said keep the chop suey and they'd credit a pork chow mein to my name/number for next time.  In their defense, the pork chop suey was quite tasty, as was the wonton soup and chicken we ordered, so it wasn't really that huge a let down in the long run. 

A few weeks later I decided to cash in on the replacement pork chow mein, and also decided to order more of their (admittedly DELICIOUS) wonton soup and some chicken balls.  Even though they have both ""Chicken Balls"" and ""Pineapple chicken"" on their menu on separate lines, and at separate prices, the order taker informs me that ""chicken balls"" are the same as ""pineapple chicken"".  Okay fine, I'll take whatever you wanna call it as long as it's the balls in the red sauce junk food that I'm craving right now.  

Although it was just standard red sauce and chicken balls, they were great, but ""pineapple chicken"" they were not.... and the ""pork chow mein"" they were supposed to send?  It was ""pork chop suey"" yet again.  I didn't bother calling to correct it this time.  The food was decent and the price is reasonable. I'll probably order from them again, but I will keep in mind that what you order off the menu is not necessarily what will show up when you open the box.",2
Restaurants,"This was the WORST Chinese food I have ever eaten. Before eating here, even 'bad' Chinese food was still 'ok' .. But this place gave new meaning to the word bad-- which is a shame, because the ladies behind the desk are absolutely lovely. 
The chow mien with chicken gave a nasty new meaning to 50 shades of grey. Grey chicken, grey vegetables, grey noodles. On top of miscellaneous brown rice. I wish it was bland... But it simply tastes old. Furthermore, I found a small brown rock in my food... Which wasn't even my least favorite bite. 
How this place has survived, I will never know. 
Absolutely deplorable.",1
Restaurants,"Quick, cheap, plentiful, Montreal style ""Chinese"" take-out food. TV 17 and Poulet Honolulu are favourites.",3
Restaurants,"I was after 10pm, and I was in need of pre-late night dinner snack. I headed out of the Metro, and quickly checked the bus schedule. Having about 12 minutes to spare I ran over to Dragon de Chine's take-out counter. 

After a quick peruse of the menu I simply ordered two egg rolls. A customer to my right was eating his soup while chatting at the counter. Then while waiting for my order another gentleman came in and ordered two egg rolls to go. I had a feeling I might be onto something good. Enough time had elapsed between ordering and its arrival that I had a feeling they would be both warm and fresh. 

Handed to me in a tall, folded and stapled brown paper bag, I noted one piece of fried rice sticking to the hand written bill as I high tailed it across the street. Seemingly with enough time to spare, I tore open the bag, rested the plum sauce as best I could on the green painted wooden bench. Trying to keep the brown paper roll hand wipe (I'd been given in place of napkins) from flying away on the wind - I dipped in generously and took a healthy bite. The shell was crispy, and the filling was warm (not burning hot). It was comprised of chopped cabbage and a sort of minced meat base. Right then my brain and stomach did the, ""am-I-gonna-get-sick-from-this mind trick,"" as I moved on to a second bite. All clear. By this time the sticky sweet sauce was starting to do its thing as well (meaning get all over the place). 

Soon after polishing off the first roll, the bus decided to arrive a little early. I hastily capped the open sauce, rolled up the ripped bag into a pouch and stepped on. Taking a seat near the rear with a free seat beside in which to set up the second half of snack-time. 

As the bus pulled away I creatively balanced the sauce container in one hand and chewed of the end of the second egg roll. Having a few stops to go, it only took me three bites to finish and pack the remnant sauces into a ready to dispose trash packet. 

My stop came, I thanked the driver, tossed my trash into the bin and walked home. Its large corner yellow neon sign displays a phone number (without area code) in the upper right corner. 

This fact helping prove that people know to find a good old school egg roll, just like inherently knowing the area code must be 514.

Note: Since I only tried the egg rolls, I am just rating them, not the overall menu/ambiance.",4
Restaurants,Very disappointed in this food.   Ordered Szecguan and every item was breaded except the rice.  I called back to complain and they quickly picked up order and sent me something else.   I told the lady that I did not want anything breaded.  She said she would compensate me by sending me chicken wings.   You guessed it they were breaded.  The 2nd order was both tasteless and colorless.  Would never order from this place again.  The ladies at the counter are very nice.,1
Restaurants,I live down the street from this place. I've been ordering from here for 7 years and would recommend the TV dinners. They're a good value for money and I have yet to be disappointed in quality. The service is quick and I also have the added benefit of seeing behaviour outside the kitchen by being their neighbor. The garbage is always neat and orderly and the staff is very respectful. Definitely a good addition to the neighborhood with fast consistent cheap eats.,5
Restaurants,"Great little place French place in a quaint Laval neighborhood just outside of Montreal. The menu is prix fixe with options for 3 to 5 courses. Be sure you understand/speak French as very little English is spoken here and the menu is all in French. The wine list covers Italy, France, Canada and a little of the US. The bottles are priced just above SAQ prices (they even list current SAQ pricing) and are a great bargain. The food was okay. The Duck Confit was well prepared except for the Cheddar cheese sauce??? No idea where that came from. The others in my party went with Beouf and Fish Specials. All turned out well and were approved of.",3
Restaurants,"Resto français intéressant, notamment pour les vins au prix de la SAQ.  Bon, pas exactement au prix de la SAQ, un peu plus élevé de quelques $$ seulement.  

Rien de gastronomique dans la présentation, définitivement plus bistro.  La cuisse de canard était succulante, quoique j'ai été surpris de la trouver servi sur un bout de fromage cheddar fondu... (c'est peut être pour garder la cuisse bien en place dans l'assiette!?!?) :-P     Le cerf (qui provient de la région) était aussi très bon.  A part la pièce de viande, on nous a servi exactement les mêmes légumes et l'assiette était présentée de facon similaire, donc on repassera pour l'originalité!  

Le pot de chocolat à la fleur de sel était bon en dessert... difficile de ne pas aimer quand on aime les desserts!  :-)

Donc si vous passez par là, n'êtes pas trop pressé, si vous y allez avant d'aller au cinéma qui est à 1 minute de là, ca vaut le coup!",3
Restaurants,"Excellent place to get a local experience and actual Quebecois food, it is 30 minutes away from downtown Montreal in Laval but well worth the trip.

We had the 5 course meal and I can definitely recommend it, the duck prosciutto, arctic scallops, salmon and lamb were all cooked to perfection, the flavors were just amazing.

Very well priced for 2 people, specially when the CAD is only 0.75 USD! 

Merci to this place.",5
Restaurants,"Assez déçu de mes plats (Potage du jour qui était sans goût, feuilleté de pétoncles et tartare de saumon: vraiment moyen) prix très cher pour ce que j'ai eu.",2
Restaurants,"I LOVE AMIR!!!! OH HOW I MISS U WHEN I COME BACK TO CALIFORNIA :(.

THE OWNER AT THIS PLACE IS SO NICE! HE REMEMBERS ME EVERYTIME I GO BACK & ALWAYS GIVE ME AN EXTRA SIDE OF RADDISH FOR FREE :)

chicken shish taouk
I want one now :(...",5
Restaurants,"Amir is great! The food is always good, and they always stuff your take-a-way box really well. Staff are really nice, and restaurant is really clean! Amir is a great food if you want a full stomach on the go.",4
Restaurants,Bad customer service and rude employees. Unfriendly atmosphere. The young girl serving me looked disgusted to work there and was purely throwing the food on the plate! Not going back,1
Restaurants,"Trapped in the Holiday Inn Express & Suites on a rainy Canada day, I struggled to find a decent dinner on Yelp. Coming up short, I decided to take a walk to the place I saw out of my hotel window. It ended up being a fast food joint of hotdogs and burgers, with poutine. I chose the poutine, being that it's Canada Day and all, and found it to be pretty similar to other poutines I've had, squeaky curds and all. The price was reasonable and service was friendly. The only seating areas are outside, with a standing bar inside.",4
Restaurants,Friendly and very fast service. The best poutine in Lachine! Make sure to ask for extra cheese.,5
Restaurants,"Un arrêt rapide sur la route, j'ai commandé une poutine, un hot-dog rôti et une root beer.
Les frites de la poutine sont excellentes, bien cuite, le fromage en grain frais, mais la sauce était très fade, goûtait l'eau...
Bon hot-dog, condiments et saussice goûte frais.
Salubrité moyenne, pas de chaises pour manger à l'intérieur, juste un comptoir que les routiers habitués utilisent.",3
Restaurants,"I happen to think LaFleur makes the best ""Michigan"" sauce (which is basically a meat sauce with a high meat to sauce ratio). Slapping that on a steamed hotdog for ""un vrai hotdog michigan"" is the best thing. I also happen to like their poutine sauce, which seems like it's the same recipe they've been using forever, but it's a bit salty. Their fries are great on their own, though I especially like them with salt and vinegar. The classic ""steamie"" hotdogs are good too, they have a drier coleslaw mix than some other places. These items literally haven't changed at all to my recollection, which is really part of the charm. This is simple, inexpensive, nostalgic fare. 
Even though it's a tiny joint where you may have to wait in line for a while (usually there are only 2 people working at a time) it's worth it - no trip to the airport is complete without a meal from LaFleur afterward!",4
Restaurants,"Name's spelled wrong, guys ""Towne Hall""..

Since there's no reviews on yelp and we had a good meal, I'll earmark this for any 'Mericans like myself that go up there and want to find a decent place.  Do Quebecois use yelp?

I don't get the negative reviews, but I went here on a Tuesday.  It was quiet, but nice.  Our waitress was friendly, anglo-Canadian.  I saw a review on another site that said ""stop hiring kids,"" but our ""kid"" was prompt, helpful, and polite.  Mustve been a bitter old ""woman-in-comfortable-shoes"" that wrote that review.

The menu is not pub fare, but it's not high-end continental, a little of everything, fish, steak, etc...can get a nice meal or a burger.

Salmon tartare and tuna tataki were great.  The lamb shank was delicious and the pureed polenta were tasty and satisfying.  The malbec our waitress suggested was delicious, not too heavy.

If you're on the West Island near the airport, it's a good option.  I'll be back.",4
Restaurants,"Un resto de belle facture, un brin tape-à l'oeil (lié je crois à son grand frère le 40 West tout près), avec une carte variée allant de l'onglet de boeuf standard au poisson grillé, en passant par les pâtes et le hamburger haut de gamme.

La cuisine est somme toute correcte mais un peu brouillonne, mon onglet médium-saignant était médium, les frites étaient ordinaires (quoique allumettes) et la salade maison non généreuse et plutôt simplette.

Les vins au verre sont plutôt bien mais le choix est trop limité pour que ce soit intéressant. Le choix à la carte est plus complet et les prix corrects.

Le service était bien.

Donc, ok pour un lunch haut de gamme avec collègues/contacts, possiblement pour un groupe du bureau/clients le soir mais pour une expérience gastronomique, mieux vaut une alternative.",3
Restaurants,"Very good resto. Not cheap though very expensive. But for me the food was worth it. Good for dates. Turns into a club after 11, mostly and older croud as well as older music.",4
Restaurants,"I really wanted to like this place. The decor is modern/classy, with large crystal chandeliers hanging from 20 foot ceilings, black and white tables and chairs, and large paintings on the walls.  The decor is quite impressive, especially given the area. There are some private areas with a lounge-y feel, good for larger groups or private parties, I assume.  One walks in expecting a nice culinary experience.

We were a group of about 12, with reservations at 8:30 on Saturday night.  We had two or three small bread baskets on the table (never replenished).  A few people were late, and although we were already ordering drinks, the waiter told us we needed to order food now (it was around 9:00, there was no line, and other tables were available ...) To seat our group, several tables were pushed together. The tables weren't level, and runners were placed along the table seams, so that uneven the tables weren't visible.  A glass of wine was set on the table seam and spilled all over the table and a few of us.  Oops! Accidents happen. Our table was cleaned and a new runner was placed on the seam (again!), but our wine soaked cutlery wasn't replaced.  I still had high hopes for the food ... 
 
I had the bouillabaisse ($27).  The presentation was nice, served in a (cast iron/ceramic?) pot, with a nice garlic bread crisp.  The bouillabaisse was less of a seafood stew and more of a cooked seafood combo placed in a broth.  The broth was bland and lacked oomph, and the fish cubes weren't  skinned.  There were quite a few mussels, two clams, two large shrimp (a little tough) and two large scallops (nicely cooked). Some fresh herbs, seasoning and simmering the broth would have gone a long way.  My boyfriend had the duck breast with a berry and porto reduction ($25). The sauce was delicious,  but the duck wasn't properly cooked/sliced and was quite tough and overly fatty - one slice contained no meat and was only a slice of fat.  Another friend had the salmon tartare (which looked amazing! Presentation was gorgeous!), but she described the flavour as mediocre at best, and wasn't impressed.  Our waiter didn't check on us after bringing our food.  The cheesecake was good. 

There are much better meals available for the price.  One pays for decor and presentation, but the flavour/cooking was a miss.  The potential is there, but better chefs and more attentive staff is a must.",2
Restaurants,"Went here on a Friday night for a girls' night. We had reservations for 8pm, and were seated promptly. The decor is very nice; modern and classy. I loved the high ceilings, chandeliers and soft lighting. We were seated in a rounded booth that gave us nice privacy but we didn't feel cramped in there. Good music played, but not loud enough for us to have to yell at each other to hear. Our waiter was very nice and charming. I ordered the fish 'n' chips, served with a small house salad and a small bowl of fries. The fish was pretty good, mind you I would have preferred a little less batter as I barely tasted the fish, but I guess that's the point (?). The salad has a sweet vinaigrette and was refreshing in contrast to the battered fish. The fries were your basic matchstick variety, but I was glad there wasn't a mountain of fries, otherwise I would've left feeling too full. My evening companions had the gnocchi, the red snapper, caesar salad with salmon tartar and a seafood linguini of sorts (respectively). They were all rather satisfied with their meals, so I would say it was a successful night. The pricing is a bit high for the meals offered, but I would go back for the overall experience.",3
Restaurants,Amazing place!!! Great food and the lounge ambiance is amazing,5
Restaurants,"Well... let's start with the ""look""  This place is big, feels like a barn, only industrial looking with accents that look out of place.

The Staff... very young and unpolished.  Obviously, it's there first job ""waitering"" and it shows in the greeting, mood, and lack of experience.  Lack of Attentiveness and no concern given to customer service.

Drinks... forget about ordering a cocktail, you will be served sporadically (I mean come on, if 7 people are there, why not deliver and server drinks all at the same time) some of us were served our cocktail 30 minutes after ordering and received during the meal.  Also, for $10 for a cosmo, how can you get it wrong... I mean come on, if you have the b@lls to charge $10, you better get it bang on or your opening yourself up to be criticized.

We ordered as a starter, Calamari... they were rubbery and greasy.  Most places get it wrong, but this place really got it wrong.  If you tried Marvins back in the day, you will know what I mean (now, even Marvin gets the standard industrial looking cuts of calamari instead of the fresh stuff).

Mains... The 8 Oz Sirloin cut was a complete 0.  Tough, grainy and very fibery cut of beef.  If you could UN_Tenderize a cut of beef, this Chef has the recipe lol.  OMG, it was unchewable.  I am being serious.  Fish and Chips was very greasy on the batter, and came with greasy thin string cut fries that were all about 1 - 1 1/2 inches in length (just weird, since they were crammed in a mini frier looking decorative basket that was 4 x 4 x 5 inches in length.  I am too believe they do not heat there frier oil high enough so the oil soaks into the batter instead of cooking and sealing the batter pours (which by cooking this way, prolongs the frier oil instead of frying at higher temperatures to produce less greasy food).  Pizza Margherita was very commercial tasting dough and sauce, but it did have fresh sliced tomatoes on top, not enough to mask the dough and sauces non freshness.  Chicken was the best of the bunch, but if Your hungry the portion is quiet small so you better order two if you didn't get served bread (We had to ask for bread 2x to receive it once, and asked many times during the meal for water refill) and if you didn't order any starters.

Pass on this place, mildly expensive, poor effort across the board.  Bottom line, even the owner seemed like one of those employees who doesn't want to be there types.  No hello or thank you when leaving the restaurant (he was standing at the front desk, while an employee was taking a reservation on the phone).

I gave the minimum tip as a courtesy.  Nobody asked why we didn't eat our sirloin, nobody even asked if everything was okay, nobody cared to smile or say hello nor thank you... oh well.",1
Restaurants,"Amazing restaurant, impeccabe service, great atmosphere, decor outstanding, food was excellent especially the chcolate fondant for dessert",5
Restaurants,Well I have to say that I was sooo pleased with this restaurant and their professionalism. Waiter was great the food was good and the they respected my request as per my reservations which I would recommend to anyone if you want to get a booth so worth it. The little down side is that I had to remind the staff that it was my wife's birthday but the cake was great. The food was good don't order pasta it's not so worth it and bring your BIG wallet. Ching Ching!! So again if your looking for pasta go to an Italian restaurant.,4
Restaurants,"My family brought me here to celebrate my Grandma's birthday. It's an impressive room, not my vibe really, cavernous, quote unquote modern. The food was ok, my grandma was happy and that was really all that mattered. Our waiter was friendly, patient, and surprised the lady of the hour with a cake and song. Nothing objectionable here and a good option in the West Island.",3
Restaurants,"All you view upon entering are warm friendly smiles and it gets better, great service,food and atmosphere beats the per se in new york.",5
Restaurants,"Une premiere pour moi dans cet énorme salle a manger. Décor genre steak house avec fauteuil en cuir et plafonds très hauts. Tables bien montées avec serviette et tissu ect. Pour ce mardi midi la moitié du restaurant est vide mais il y a quand même de l'ambiance. La majorité des clients sont comme nous en lunch d'affaire. La table d'hôte du midi comprend une salade verte ou un carpaccio de betteraves. Les prix vont de 20$ A 30$ par table d'hôte. J'ai choisi le  carpaccio qui était très léger et frais. Très bonne idée et de belles couleurs. Pour la bouillabaisse, je dois dire que ce fut moyen. Des fruits de mer très frais mais le bouillon était fade.  Le service était excellent , professionnel.  Tout compte fait, ce fut moyen mais je vais lui donner une deuxième chance un de ces jours.",3
Restaurants,"I seriously hate leaving negative reviews but this place deserves it.   Then food is always kind of hit or miss but something that is always consistently bad is the service.  I desperately would love to find a place in the west island my husband and I can frequent but After going there, way too many times over the years, we still don't even get a hello from the manager.  I don't know but last time I checked if you had frequent customers, at least say hello to them.  But the problem is they hire kids which if you do that, at least give them proper training.  Kids at the door, kid waiters, kid managers...just kids.  Also ambiance; there is always a horrible echo...they need to get some speakers placed around the tables to balance off the weird echos.  Most important my meal last night.  They did not have the type of chicken I ordered and instead of advising me and asking what I'd like instead, they just bring me a replacement of bland rubbery chicken.  Didn't touch it but didn't complain either so the waiter says ""oh I feel bad...can I at least get you a drink?""  They need to up the quality of their staff to match the prices on their menu as right now the place is run like a cheap bar.  And when you see familiar faces, at least greet them.  Amateurs.",1
Restaurants,"Nice place with great atmosphere - very cosmopolitan. For the most part the food was good. I had the flat bread appetizer with some sort of cream cheese and spice; it was very tasty. However, I'm giving 3 stars because the cheeseburger was way overdone, did not taste good at all.

My colleague had the Greek Village salad with salmon, which he liked. He also had the chicken noodle soup, which he raved about. So perhaps just avoid the burgers when you come here.",3
Restaurants,"Used to be a great spot to get dressed up and enjoy a fancier dinner in the West Island. But the last two times I've been, the food has been extremely disappointing. I've always loved the beef tartar but this weekend it was unseasoned and fatty. I decided to try the Mac and cheese and it was neon orange and looked like a box of Kraft Dinner - and for $17 it shouldn't be! My friends were equally disappointed in their overcooked and badly cut Bavette and salmon tartar. Would be unfortunate for the West Island to lose one of their few good restaurants but that is where Towne Hall is going. Am wondering if they recently changed chefs...",1
Restaurants,"Mediocre at best. We went for a team dinner and out of 10+ people in attendance, no one raved about their meal and no one thought it was bad...always ""my meal was ok.""  Nothing stood out. 

Decor and bar was cool and service was fine.",3
Restaurants,I've been here multiple times. They have probably the worst service of any resto in Montreal.,1
Restaurants,"The decor is great, nice little place and service was really nice.

My caesar salad was a little soggy, too much dressing. 

My main course was a lobster BLT and let me tell you, it was really great! Lobster was fresh and lemony and had a great taste.

I would definitely go back again.",4
Restaurants,"It's my go-to place when I want to dress up and have good drinks, while remaining in the west island. The drinks are a little pricy but very good. I never actually had a meal there so I can't comment on the food. The restaurant is very nice and trendy and I love the hip atmosphere. I definitely recommend it if you're too lazy to drive downtown but still want that supper club experience.",4
Restaurants,"Excellent restaurant , high ceilings relaxing classy place , very rare and unique in Montreal , the staff very attentive and the food one of the best : we started with drinks then the Greek salad with feta and the salmon tartare , the main dishes were mainly of fish , one fish and chips and the second dish was halibut  with gnocchi , then the salmon with mushroom rice was excellent , a place to visit and the price reasonable for the quality , I enjoyed it especially that it was not on the salty side as all the other restaurants  in Montreal ! Will sure come back often .",5
Restaurants,"Everytime I visit this restaurant,  I love it.!! The high ceilings and beautiful chandeliers and classy decor  take you to another world .. away from the suburbs... 

The round tables booths are my favorite 
..the  white dishes on the table with beautifully displayed food are yummylicious ..and the service amazing ...",4
Restaurants,"I love La Belle Province.

 I really wish this location was better. It goes to show you that it's a franchise, and each Storefront will be different if not managed by the same people.

 My sister and I came for lunch with her friend who lives nearby and knows good food.
He told me it has just changed ownership. I spoke with the cooks and was happy to hear they're Greek, okay I'm stereotyping about how great of cooks they are.

The fries were just good, the cheese was like rubber and didn't melt in the Poutine, not good.  

The smoked meat sandwich was not Hot like the other ones I've had. And it seemed like the smoked meat was cheap and generic.

The hands of new ownership seems to be going downhill, shame.  The decor also seems to be old and wearing down and looks dirty, again shame 50's decor should be fun, not old.",3
Restaurants,"They were so good a few years back.. before the ""asians"" took over. I mean the Dr. Knows a good Labelle when he eats it but apart from keeping the old owner on as a mentor the place is lack luster.",3
Restaurants,"Hands down the best wings on the island.
Tuesday night 2 for 1 wings are a must.
I love going with the guys, picking from their large selection of beers and having the meatiest, juciest and best sauced wings around.
Staff is very friendly and helpful.
Sometimes it gets a bit crowded due to its small size, but it's worth the wait every time!",5
Restaurants,"People often ask me how a restaurant gets a five star review. For me it's simple, when a place offers something amazing. In this case, it's the wings. They are the best you'll ever have. Order them without any sauce, ask for the sauce on the side. Prepare your taste buds for chicken wing utopia! It will set a new baseline of greatness.   Mmmmm",5
Restaurants,Great bar with good music and some very good bands on the weekends. The beer is good but the selection could be better. The food is good but the wings are out of the world ! Wish they did delivery !! Friendly atmosphere and nice staff !,4
Restaurants,"Disappointing New years day dinner. 
We've been there before and enjoyed the food but last night's Pub menu was not expected for dinner at 6:00 pm.
We had checked their website prior to going but there wasn't any  mention of a limited supper menu.",3
Restaurants,I only come in on Tuesday's for the wing special. It's buy 6 get 6 free. You get a dozen wings for $10 which is pretty good. Th wings are huge and there good flavours to choose from. It does get packed with students. Good wings and food prices.,4
Restaurants,"If you are looking for anything that resembles authentic Chinese food, this is definitely not for you.  Though the dishes are distinctly westernized, I have to say it isn't really all that bad.  Imagine a Panda Express, but with a sit-down restaurant setting, better food, a wider menu, and all-you-can-eat.  

I have a hard time explaining to my dad how I can tolerate eating at distinctly non-chinese, chinese restaurants.  Well, my response is that as long as you don't expect chinese food, you might actually enjoy what is being served.  After all, sushi rolls with mayo and fried jalapenos are obviously not traditional Japanese, but ask me if I care while I stuff my face with its savory goodness.

Sorry but if liking orange beef is wrong - i don't want to be right.

(discount if you pay in cash)",3
Restaurants,"This is a strange place! It's been around for a long time. My father drags me here once a year so he can eat unlimited peanut butter dumplings. It's quite the sight I can assure you. 

The food is pretty good as Szechuan restaurants usually go. Of course it's all you can eat, and by the looks of most of the patrons, this is common knowledge in the area. Where this place falls flat on its face is the decor. If there was ever a restaurant that needed some new chairs, carpets, wallpaper, paint, & tablecloths... this is the place! The food is probably at 3 1/2.

I recommend pants with elastic waist bands.",2
Restaurants,"It's a good place of you love MSG and food that tastes all the same. The only dishes I enjoyed were the fried squid and the noodles/veggie plate. Besides that, whether you eat pepper beef or pineapple shrimp, it all tastes alike. Not impressed",2
Restaurants,"The food is definitely very tasty and fresh.
The service is good but deteriorates if you're a table full of guys trying to out eat each other, which is understandable.
This is the proper alternative to an AYCE buffet.
PS, paying with cash get youa  5% discount!",4
Restaurants,"I mostly order out from here - tonight ate in - food quality is excellent - sweet & sour pork - chicken fried rice - all good and nice service.   This is a very busy restaurant on friday, saturday and sunday evenings... call and make reservations.",4
Restaurants,"Un des meilleurs restaurants asiatiques de l'ouest-de-l'île.  Biensûr, la décoration n'est pas merveilleuse (j'attends encore de trouver un resto asiatique 'chic'), mais la nourriture y est d'excellente qualité: les viandes sont tendres, les goûts raffinés.  Excellent également en livraison, ça arrive tout chaud même si on demeure assez loin!  Je recommande fortement!",4
Restaurants,"Went here for lunch with family. It was all you can eat, decent price. Service was fair, although at the end the server asked what drinks we had because he did not keep track  which was strange. The food was okay, a lot of deep fried dishes. The shrimp was delicious! Great place for families or large parties as it is all you can ear. Ambiance is fair. Would go back but not a first choice.",3
Restaurants,This place offers a goos variety of food at a decent price. I was underwhelmed by the greasy boneless rib appetizer and the pepper chicken entrée.  But the fried dumplings and green beans are  excellent!,3
Restaurants,"Ok... Let's be honest. Decor is weird, waiters are sometimes rude and it is definitely not an authentic experience. It's not the healthiest option either...  But it's delicious and sometimes, that's all that matters!!!

Every dish I tried there was good. A lot of fried food... Heavy on both salt and sugar. Nevertheless, it is wonderful for a night of indulgence.

Enjoy!",4
Restaurants,"Food here is always consistent. Hot, tasty, fresh. Won't find another Asian spot like it. I have been coming here for 15 years and it hasn't changed. Moved to Toronto and this is still my favourite spot for some Asian food :)!",5
Restaurants,Very tasty Chinese cuisine in the west island. Their peanut butter dumplings cannot be beaten!,4
Restaurants,"As a Chinese, I think that the food here is pretty good and tasty. From a price point of view, it all depends on how you like to order your food. The soup and rice is charged by the bowl, so as a Chinese family who is ordering a la carte, it isn't necessarily the best deal in town. The portions for a la carte dishes are very decent for sharing though. 

However, their all you can eat ""buffet"" option is fantastic for people who want to try a little bit of everything. The concept is essentially the same as an all you can eat sushi place, but it's a Chinese and Thai restaurant. I don't know if the portions are a little smaller on the buffet side to allow you to try more dishes, but for the price, I think it's a wonderful way to have a nice meal out with family or friends. 

The ambiance in the restaurant was very nice. The service was extremely speedy.",4
Restaurants,"The dishes here are quite expensive. The quality is terrible.... Maybe it's the difference between Toronto and Montreal in terms of competitiveness, the same dish, with this quality, even at half the price, this restaurant still won't survive for 3 months. All six at the table concurred, represented opinion from Ontario and UK. Won't be back sorry.",2

Restaurants,"I literally had to join Yelp because of the absolute terrible experience I had here tonight.

We were a party of 6 and 5 of us received our food while the 6th did not for another 15 minutes. 

I asked the waiter twice and was given quick short answers because they were running serving the table next to us (party of 12). Finally I got fed up and asked to speak to a manager. While normally this should help the situation, this was not the case. 

The manager was not only rude, but confrontational. He began to explain that there was a mistake (mistakes happen yes) and telling me how many chefs he has (4) and how he can't have them all work on our meals. I don't quite follow how a restaurants staffing is the customers issue? I said that all our food is now cold. He said ""no one told you to wait"". I'm sorry, has common decency gone out the window? I was raised to be polite. I said I would appreciate something to be done i.e. the forgotten meal be given at no cost. And was responded with ""I make 2$ a dish, I can't just do that"". Apparently this is the manager/owner?? He should be ashamed of his customer service skills, or lack thereof. 

Oh and I threatened to write this review seeing as I have no other recourse... 20 minutes later he's offering a free drink. Needless to say at that point we declined.",1
Restaurants,"Good service, mad selection of imported beers @120. Menu was limited but the food was good. Nice little terasse but I did not see the interior. We will visit again many times for sure.",4
Restaurants,Ca n'est plus tout à fait ce qu'il a déjà été mais reste tout de même un incontournable,3
Restaurants,"Très bon repas de moules frites et assortiment de bières impressionnant.

La terrasse est très bien, même si nous sommes près du boul. Taschereau.",4
Restaurants,"Made a reservation for a large group and we were seated in a private room. We missed out on the gorgeous main area, but the experience was still awesome overall.

The service was on point: it wasn't out of this world, but it was still pretty decent.

We went there for their selection of beers and we weren't disappointed. My girlfriend and I tasted 4 different beers and they were all good. My other friends tried many other varieties and the waiter even helped some of them figure out what they wanted to drink and was very helpful.

The food was amazing! I had Szechuan mussels with fries and it was delicious. I also tasted my girlfriend's beef stew and it reminded me of a Belgian dish I had over there a while ago.

Overall, I was very satisfied and I would definitely go back some other time.",5
Restaurants,"Food was bellow par (in that price range), was disappointed with my plate and waiter said ""I know we should take it off the menu"", why not tell me in advance? Place is tight, they try to fit way too many tables in their limited space. Took an hour an a half before we got our main. There's way better places out there, don't bother.",1
Restaurants,"Magnifique terrasse située à l'arrière, intime.

Excellent service discret, attentionné, de bons conseils.

C'est un restaurant ""Apportez votre vin"" (prévoqyez une bonne bouteille)

La crème brûlée au foie gras, garnitures de petits fruits et pain brioché grillé est délicieuse.

J'ai pris un ""burger"" en dessert. C'est en fait un scone (pain à burger), galette de ganache au chocolat (viande), fraise(tomates) et  bâtonnets de mangue ( frites), petites guimauves(fromage), coulis de fruits rouges (ketchup)

Un peu cher (60$ par personne), c'est surtout pour une occasion spéciale",4

Restaurants,"20 janvier 2013
Par un dimanche glacé, une fringale de smoked meat me transporte chez Chenoy's, une institution à Brossard depuis 20 ans, cette année. L'accueil se fait par le doyen de la place, un petit monsieur tout joyeux et heureux de vous servir. Le service s'est fait par la charmante France. Quoi choisir ? trop de choix. Le classique spécial Chenoy's, rien de mieux. Un club sandwich tout en smoked meat. Pas besoin d'entrée, vous serez rassasié ! Essayez aussi la poutine au smoked meat. Tant qu'à manger du smoked meat, faites-en une soirée ;-) 

January 20th 2013
On an icy sunday, a snack attack for smoked meat leads me to Chenoy's, a Brossard institution for 20 years now. Greatings at the entrance from the wisest man of the place, very happy to serve you. The waiting at the table was made by the always charming France. What to choose from the menu ? too many choices. The classic special Chenoy's is a must. A nice smoked meat club sandwich. No need for apetizers, you 'll be full by the end of the plate ! Try the smoked meat poutine. Why not eat all smoked meat since you're there ;-)",4
Restaurants,"Une horreur !

On est peut etre mal tombé mais je donne mon avis quand même. 
Nous passons commande a 18h... le livreur arrive a 20h !!! J'avais appeler 3x et a chaque fois une personne qui ne parle bien ni le français ni l'anglais me . disait 5-10 minutes.

Tout est arrivé tiede voir froid...

Plus jamais !",1
Restaurants,"5 étoiles simplement parce qu'il s'agit de l'un des meilleurs restaurants de viande fumée de la région métropolitaine. Naturellement on peut y prendre autre chose et le menu est varié. Coté viande fumée cependant ce restaurant excelle. Le sandwich de viande fumée à l'ancienne (légèrement plus épicé) est un délice. Les portions sont généreuses et on peut sélectionner, comme dans tout restaurant du genre, le niveau de gras. Pour ma part 'moyen' donne un sandwich tendre et juteux. Les frites sont bonnes et l'accompagnement classique pour ce genre de plat.
Sinon il y a la pizza, les lasagnes et le reste. De quoi plaire à tous. D'autre part il faut noter qu'il s'agit d'un restaurant ouvert 24 heure la fin de semaine et qui ferme vers les 3 heures en début de semaine, idéal pour les bouchées tardives.",5
Restaurants,Nice family place for a good meal! Their smoked meat and cheesecake are quite popular here! Service a bit bad but overall not a bad place!,3
Restaurants,What to say about Chenoy's had many 2AM dinners there over the decade!!! I tend to go there because its open 24H a day not because the food is actually amazing. They have several smoked meat dishes which are okay and it does the jog!!! The menu has a basically almost everything but wouldn't say anything really stands out in terms of dishes.,2
Restaurants,Toujours très bon et vraiment pas cher pour la qualité! Les moules sont savoureuses et il est difficile de ne pas terminer ses frites...,4
Restaurants,"We have been travelling by boat and pulled onto Longueuil and were famished. This place was highly rated by several sites and locals. 
The food and service were great. My wife had a great saumon tartar and I had the pasta special.",4
Restaurants,Moules et frites délicieuses. Tartare de saumon et frites délicieux. Bon service et bonne compagnie. Un très bon resto et une facture raisonnable. Deuxième visite et on répètera sûrement.,4
Restaurants,"Je suis allee lors d'un brunch improvise de lundi de Paques, c'etait ouvert contrairement a plein d'autres restaurants. C'est deja un plus. 

Services: bon service tout droit sortie de l'ITHQ, mais pas tres chaleureux.

Nourriture: c'etait vraiment moyen. J'ai pris les oeufs benedictines qui etaient tres bon en soi, mais personnelent je les ai trouve cheap dans le jambon, ca goutait meme pas, je l'ai cherche lol! Les patates etait bonne mais rien de wow. Si non j'ai fait ma gourmande et pris un croissant...il etait horrible pour un bistro francais. On aurait dit que c'etait un croissant d'epicerie mis au four trop longtemp. Le cafe etait correct. Honnement, j'y retournetais pour re tester si je suis dans coin, question de voir si c'etait a cause de Paques. Mais sans grande attentes. 

Prix: plus abordable que je pensais. Tip inclus: 23$ pour mes oeufs, cafe au lait et croissant. 

Le plus interessant c'est le solarium arriere et la terrasse avant. Je me vois bien prendre un verre de vin la cette ete. En plus, pour les groupe c'est super grand, 2 etages.",4
Restaurants,"It was love at first sight (or first meal?) with this wonderful restaurant on Montreal's south shore. It is located in the nice neighborhood of ""Vieux Longueuil"" and have an open terrasse in the front and a large ""verrière"" in the back which is wonderful with the changing climate here and create a space which seems larger.

They have a formula where you can choose any entree and make it a set price menu by adding either soup and appetizer or appetizer and dessert. I opted for the former option.

My first course was a cold potage which was wonderful and did put me in a summery mind set on a spring that seems to be just a long fade-out of winter. I followed it with a warm goat cheese salad and had a delicious and generous salmon tartar as the main course. They are also serving warm fresh bread (as much as you dare eat).

Everything was perfectly executed and served in a very convivial and professional way. I will mention this little attention which made the experience even better; My friend (the one that brought me here and is responsible for this discovery) wanted to drink white wine (I drink red even with everything) and I was incline to have an apéritif before the meal but didn't want to drink to much. So, once we settled on a bottle of chardonnay, I asked the server if he could poor some cassis liquor in my first glass of wine (making it a kir) and he was very happy to obliged. That made for an excellent compromise! The kind of flexibility that is somewhat exceptional (but should not!) in the restaurant industry.

""L'incredule"" instantly became one of my favorite table in town and it totally worth it to make a short trip from downtown Montréal to Longueuil to experienced it!",5
Restaurants,"I first came to Shogun on one of my first visits to Québec around 2008-2009. I can completely corroborate Sharm D.'s version of events because they happened to my party of about 12. Now my francophone family (with the exception being my wife) seemed to be in on the ""gag"" so I am not completely sure if this was something that was part of the dining ""experience"". It certainly overshadowed the rest of my evening but the chef did spray sesame seeds in the same manner as previously described towards my sister-in-law. 

The food is alright, I am not sure if it justifies the high price tag especially when the seafood is way overcooked. The ""show"" is almost identical to the one at Benihanas back home.

I am guessing that is part of the ""charm"" of this place. It is expensive, has an aquarium of sad-looking fish and has some odd ceiling bulges. It looks like a fairly run down building which is slightly surprising since a lot of Québec restaurant culture almost demands decent renovations every so often, hell, the Tim Hortons down the way from me was completely remodeled. With our meal for 2 we were served room temperature water and sodas with unexceptional ""Japanese"" onion soup. I would sooner try a place in Chinatown proper next time but live and learn.",2
Restaurants,"Unexpectedly gratifying. When I  first encountered this place, I was skeptical. Came here on a Saturday and the place was jam packed. It took them a while to sit our group of 16 (they want to make sure everyone is there before you can sit in your room, so you must wait in the lobby). Once we were seated like sardines around the table,  the 'show' began. Because essentially that's what it is, a show. Our cook was HILARIOUS. He is the reason I gave this review 4 stars and not 3. Now, some found him funny,  others found him despicable. All that to say that the cook you'll have in front of you will either make or break your evening. 

The food was ok. I took the combination menu which basically consists of a soup, a salad, 2 choices of meats, rice,  veggies and I think a dessert (we left before). All that for about $27. Most people around me couldn't finish their plates because too full.

Will I come back on my own free will? Not likely. 
Did we enjoy ourselves, eat well and had a good time? Absolutely !",4
Restaurants,"Great prices for BBQ chicken and ribs. A south shore classic located in the La Prairie farmers market.
No credit cards or Interac accepted. Expect a line, however takeout orders are faster.",5
Restaurants,"Best Ribs and chicken I've ever had.  The restaurant looks like it was built in the 70's, and so do the staff ;)  Great sign that they have been doing this for a long time, the food is great but a very limited menu.  BBQ chicken and ribs...that's it!  My fave were the ribs, smokey and really good, the spicy sauce on the side is a good change from all the sweet ribs.

If you want to get a seat during lunch or dinner, expect an hour wait.  I usually head straight",5
Restaurants,First thing to mention is that their prices are the best. A bit more than 7$ (TX incl) for a repas cuisse. The chicken is really good but their fries are even better. We are not talking about mcdo frozen fries here. The only down side and the reason why they are no getting a 5 stars are the ribs. They are well cooked but the sauce on it is not great: basically a thick bbq sauce with not much flavor. I would still recommend eating there.,4
Restaurants,"went there 3 adults and a 2 year old child, we all tried both chicken and ribs and you cant ask for a better deal for what you get. Price is Very reasonable especially the (family special) the chicken is great, the ribs fall off the bone. Waitresses are very nice mature women. feels like an old diner inside with only booths (banquettes) from what i saw but Very clean.  i live 10 minute walk away and was my first time there.  we will definitely be going back.",5
Restaurants,"Now I'm no restaurant expert in Terrebonne, but as local breakfast places go, this one is hard to match! 

Large menu, friendly staff, convenient location, fast service, and friendly owners who are always around.",4
Restaurants,"Good service... But personality wise a little snob'ishhh.
Food is always AAA.
Great place to go with friends n family.",4
Restaurants,"Dropped into this place with a family member who lived close by.  Affordable prices and the food was really good.  It's a cross between a greasy spoon and a homemade mom and pop shop.  
I had a roast beef melt on a kaiser...actually, it was killer. Really enjoyed it.  I had their soups, which when I commented that I liked it to the waitress, she commented all the soups are homemade. 

Only reason, I gave it 3 stars is that the service wasn't over the top. It was good, prompt but the engagement was a bit on the lower end. 

Good place to drop in and have a bite and be on your way again.",3
Restaurants,"Although its appearance is underwhelming, this location has some of the best BBQ I've ever tasted.  Far better than you'd find at any Big Box restaurant, this restaurant has excellent BBQ ribs, burgers, wings, sandwiches, and home made pies.

The prices are very reasonable.  I got a half rack of ribs and wings plate with vegetables and a baked potato for $15.  The ribs fall apart and require very little chewing; they've been slow cooked to perfection.  Their BBQ sauce on both their ribs and wings was outstanding - a smokey, sweet flavour, which also tastes like it could be home cooked.

If you have room after their healthy portions, try a slice of their home made coconut or banana cream pie.  One slice easily finishes off a great meal, and is more than enough to share with another person.

I agree the service could be better, and the decor could be updated. However, the food is phenomenal.",4
Restaurants,"The appearance of this restaurant is from back in the 80's it is definitely in need of a renovation however I've been wanting to try this place for quite a while I live just down the street. I have never heard a review of the place from any friends or family but decided to give it a try. 

The special of the night was outside beef roast the people I was with decided on that I decided to order the 8oz strip steak and shrimp with fries. The steak was bland it was not seasoned before cooking it must have been pre-cooked and the. Just heated to serve when I got it. It was like rubber I should have sent it back but I decided not too as I won't be back. The fries were bland as well I wonder if they ever use any salt on anything. 

In the end the service from the waitress was good she did look after us well the food and the decor will keep me from coming back.",1
Restaurants,"Great breke - standard fare, but cheap!",4
Restaurants,"The ladies that own this place won the lottery...they clearly put zero of that money into the business. It's dank, but not in a cool way. I ordered take out for my dad (he lives across the street and LOVES the place) and when I went to pick it up I decided to take a seat at the bar. BIG MISTAKE. A drunken regular began yelling at me saying that was another regular's seat and I'm not allowed to sit there. 

They have karaoke on Saturday nights but it's mostly regulars singing country songs, they aren't too welcoming to non-regulars. 
I'd stay away.",1
Restaurants,"Surprisingly tasty Indian food and a really good price. Pretty sure it's buffet only. We stayed at the Hampton Inn on the other side of the parking lot and stopped in for lunch one afternoon. Definitely worthwhile if you have a hankering for some Indian food outside of Toronto. You can't really get away with bad Indian food in these parts, can you?",4
Restaurants,"I'm a little sceptical, now I see the tip about the heath dept. Should've looked on yelp first, shucks! Despite that, I've already eaten here and can't take it back now. I thought it was flippin' great. It was my first time eating somewhere that only had India options. Everything was really great, though it was a small buffet. I liked all the vegetarian options too. Lots of 'em! At only $6 for ayce dinner buffet, how can you go wrong, er, right. The only thing that really threw me off was the fact that the waitress seated everyone on one half of the Restaurant, and it was a pretty busy night. I found this very odd. I would prefer to be away from people if the options there.",3
Restaurants,"The woman at the desk at the Hampton Inn told us that ""the food was cold"" when she went to this restaurant across the parking lot from the hotel, but we like Indian, food, the kids will eat it, so we gave it a try.  What they call ""Butter Chicken"" tasted like Tiki Masala to me, and it was good.  The goat was kind of greasy.  The naan was okay, but a little cold.  The little veggie dumplings were good, and they had some made of sweet potatos.  Upon looking at my receipt, it appears homeboy added a 15% tip on top of the total, and I ended up giving 15% additional.  Not wise, especially for a buffet.",3
Restaurants,This was the worst Indian food I've ever tried in Canada. I went there for their buffet and it was absolutely horrible. Everything was bland and you can tell they reuse their old chicken in their curries. The best Indian restaurant in the KW area is definitely Empress of India. Avoid Masala Bay as they reuse old food.,1
Restaurants,"Not bad, if you're looking for a quick Indian food fix. It's a buffet, with all regulars. The saag paneer wasn't bad, just very little cheese, and the butter chicken was decent. The goat curry seemed like it had a lot of bones in it, but my coworker enjoyed it. The server was good, and very polite. If I was staying at the Hampton inn and had to rush through dinner I'd go back, but I'd pass otherwise.",2
Restaurants,"Taste food, good price",5
Restaurants,"Visited Friday for dinner buffet $9.99 (lowered their prices from $12.99 which is a much better price for the size of the buffet).  
Waitress spoke very little English and understood even less.  We ordered hot sauce, which the chef/cook usually prepares upon request,  and had to explain it several times to waitress and still never got it!  Even the couple seated next to us had a hard time ordering Chai tea.  The server didn't understand what Masala Chai Tea was?  Not impressed with the server.
Windowsills, floors and chairs were all filthy!  I had to look for a clean chair as the fabric was filthy and very stained.  Makes us wonder if the outside area where you can see is not clean, how clean is the food prep area that we can't see?  They need to improve their standards. They really need to invest in cleaning this place up and refreshing the decor.
The food is absolutely fantastic and this is the only reason I gave it 2 stars.",2
Restaurants,"Great food. More variety than I expected walking in. Traditional and well spiced. Service is friendly and quick.
Work sent me to the next door Hampton Inn and I am glad I decided to check this restaurant out.",5
Restaurants,"I tried their lunch buffet yesterday during my recent visit to Canada. If you are a vegetarian, they don't have much option in their lunch buffet as it happen to me and two other guest who were also vegetarian.. I like their naans... Saag paneer was ok, disappointed with Chana dish, Dal makhni was my favorite dish in the buffet. Overall ok place but don't think I will try this place again.",3
Restaurants,"Ignore the snobby reviews. This is the best bang for your buck in the tri-cities/Guelph. It's not meant to be upscale, it's built in an old wendys. I don't know what people expect. 

I've tried almost everything on the buffet. Always great. The price is cheap, you can get the buffet, a pop, leave a decent tip, pay the tax, all for under 20 bucks. I've only ever had exceptional service. Stuff is always quickly refilled at the buffet. 

Pretty sure they make their own naan, it's the best I've ever had. Always hot and fresh. 

Some stuff is pretty spicy, so try a little of every thing before diving in.

The desserts are home made and great. The rice pudding is to die for. 

If you like Indian food, this place is a must try. Focus on the quality of the food and if you're disappointed, I don't know what to tell you.",5
Restaurants,"I would give this place a negative star if I had an option. I was craving hot masala chai with some Indian food. I asked the girl at the counter if I can order chole bhature and she said we are out of stock. Whatever that means! Didn't want to do buffet cuz it was alot of food. Asked her what spicy rice had and she just told me that rice which is spicy..gee thanx. She got my order wrong which was palak paneer, naan n chai. I asked if I could sit in and she said ok. I got the food in a white garbage bag with paneer over flowing from the container. After arguing with me 2 for mins then she finally decided to order the chai that she forgot. I turned around and said that I will start eating and just bring the tea. She turned around and rudly told me that I can't cuz ur order is a takeout! What the hell? You can't eat in unless you are doing the buffet. Waited another 10 mins and finally got the tea..by this time i had toss the tea cuz it was in dirty cup and they probably spat in it. Seriously! Horrible.. I paid $22 for food that I barely ate. The place dingy and dirty.",1
Restaurants,"I stopped in here by chance last week and was pleased to find a cheaper alternative to eat. The hosts are nice and the buffet is quick, easy and had several veggie options so there was no problem there. We went there a second time this week and aren't disappointed with the food. If you are looking for a fancy fine dining experience there are better options but for $10 I can't complain and it will be a place to go if we are in the area at lunch time again.",4
Restaurants,"Good buffet with five or six entrees plus salads and desserts. Inexpensive. The staff are friendly and efficient. If you want staff to fawn over you, don't go here. But if you want to be treated like a regular person by regular people, this is the place.",4
Restaurants,Nice and simple traditional Indian food. Not overpriced. We enjoyed goat curry / naan and chhola batura.,3
Restaurants,"Placed a take-out order with a couple of friends in person. They said it would be a 30 minute wait, and refused when I asked to pay right away. We agreed and walked across the street to our hotel. We returned 25 minutes later to see our receipts still sitting at the cashier. The host told us they had no idea if we still wanted our orders because we left, and that we shouldn't have left if we wanted our food to be ordered. Ridiculous and incompetent service, not to mention the blocked off windows to hide the kitchen. No idea how this place is in business.",1
Restaurants,"Sorry to say that the buffet was terrible and the services not much better. My complaint about the food is that the dishes at the buffet table were not quite warm, and the food had no flavor (hard to do with Indian food...) I was told by the server to use plates instead of small bowls for main dishes (I like to use bowls so the saucy Indian dishes won't get all mixed up in a plate) He pointed to a sign saying this when he noticed me trying put to goat curry sauce in a cup. This is the first Indian place that told me not to use bowls (bowls were evidently meant for desert only), so I asked why and the guy there said so they won't have to wash so many bowls... Hmm... OK...  One good thing that came out of this is, we didn't have to pay a lot to find out we never want to go back. I have probably been to about 30 Indian restaurants (most of them in California) and this one takes the last prize - far behind from all the rest.",1
Restaurants,"We been years coming to this restaurant and the taste not change....still same owner ...I guess.
The taste of the food is not that strong. If you taste the butter chicken....you can taste of tomatoes.  The meat of goat soft but not to soft. Chicken tandoori have more taste to it but I always think why they remove the chicken skin?
I guess for $11.49 for dinner is good deal compare with other places.",4
Restaurants,"Went for lunch and the selection was not very big. There are only three meat entrees: goat curry, butter chicken, and tandoori chicken. And there are four vegetarian entrees, as well as a salad bar. The food actually tasted good. I'm giving a relatively low rating because I got a stomach ache after dining there...",2
Restaurants,"I was driving east along Weber on a Saturday, and noticed this place to the left on Louisa . I'm only writing this to warn people away from this place. It was the worse breakfast I have ever had and the lunch isn't much better! Ill leave it brief my son had lunch I had breakfast both were not cooked properly ( undercooked) The fries and home fries were both hard or should I say raw,  The floor had food on it that looked like it was there for awhile. If your still thinking of eating there take out a life insurance policy first.",1
Restaurants,"Your typical greasy spoon, it's fast and cheap. The value you get is decent (a solid breakfast for $5), but you get what you pay for. Service is non-existent. Interior is old though kept clean. Go for it if you need a cheap breakfast and don't have time to make it yourself. I'm tempted to add a star for the hilarity of ""Bud's Magic #2"", but the lack of service brings it down again.",2
Restaurants,"Yes, this place has about 20 years of grease from the friars coating all surfaces in sight. Yes in classic terms the service is non-existent. You will have to pour your own coffee, and grab your own utensils. However, I would say that all adds to the character that makes this place an excellent breakfast choice after a long night on the town. It's a family run establishment and the owners have character. I'll take an interesting owner with character, who knows every regular that comes in any day of the week. The portion sizes are beyond generous and the prices are cheap. For a cheap breakfast joint, I found that the food was actually quite good. The hash browns don't come from the microwave, which is becoming all to common these days.

I came in here with a group of 15 people, and we completely slammed their kitchen. However, they battled through it, and produced an impressive amount of breakfast cuisine. They didn't screw up our orders, and the food came out relatively quick for the amount of people we had. Which is more than I can say for the majority of restaurants in KW with a group that size.",4
Restaurants,"Delicious breakfast, cheap cheap cheap. Atmosphere is awesome in my opinion, cross between a diner and grandma's house :D will be back, often.",5
Restaurants,"Would love to have one of these in the states. They offer mostly different kinds of chicken. My favorite was the blackened chicken, but they also had cajun BBQ and Bourbon chicken. Both of those were pretty good as well. As a side, you can also have chinese noodles, rice, or mashed potatoes. I know they also had corn and some other southern staples. Pretty tasty for mall food and the prices are reasonable.",4
Restaurants,The bourbon chicken with rice and green beans is a fantastic lunch. You can't go wrong with that. This is a food court restaurant but the food is very good. I'd love to comment on the other food there but I always get the same thing because it is so great.,4
Restaurants,"I love Bourbon Street Grill. When I am at a mall and its there in the food court, I automatically order food there. 

It's my first time at the mall. The food court is nice. It even has booths. 

I ordered combo #2. I got bourbon chicken with rice, green beans and corn. I love the veggies here. The green beans come with chopped garlic. They aren't seasoned or buttered to death, which I appreciate. 

The bourbon chicken is perfect. It's both tender and flavourful. It is by go-to choice. 

The woman serving me gave me a spring roll on the house. It seems weird to get a spring roll. However, the place does have chow mein noodles. 

I love this place. It accepts cash and debit only.",4
Local Flavor,"What an amazing feature in this extremely cold city in the winter. I went to Montreal in February 2007, and while many people said I was crazy, I knew about this underground city while researching my trip.

Montreal's underground city is directly underneath this amazing city. It is 19 miles long, and it links many major buildings and shopping options.

This underground city is spotless! As a New Yorker, I walked through this tunnel, and was amazed by the cleanliness of the passageways.

So many restaurants, stores and other things to do while walking around the city below Montreal. My hotel, the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth had an escalator outside its lobby door that brought you down to the underground city.",4
Local Flavor,"We were all -- me and the 12-year-old niblings -- impressed with the cleanliness and efficiency of the underground walkways and buildings. ""This is nothing like New York, it's clean,"" they repeated several times. It's truly a terrific idea in a city that can get blisteringly cold. Even though we were here at summer's end, we really enjoyed the uniqueness of subterranean shopping, and even the pre-teens could appreciate the practicality. I only wish the entrances were better marked, since it seems we passed several before finally figuring out how to get in.",4
Local Flavor,"You must be kidding me. I don't get what people are talking about when they talk about the underground city (much less as an actual tourist attraction). Tourists all know about it but ask any Montrealer and they scoff at the very idea. The ""underground city"" is nothing more than a series of interconnected shopping malls on St. Catherine in the downtown of Montreal. Lots of boring, overpriced stores (just remember: if you miss one Aldo shoe store, just keeping walking and you'll be sure to find another) and crappy food courts.  Sure, wandering through that dizzying maze of consumer nothingness is preferable to walking outside when it's 30 below in February but that's not saying much now, is it?",1
Local Flavor,"Perhaps if I had visited in the winter I would have been more impressed. 

The underground city is interesting to me as we don't have them in Vancouver, however it is essentially a series of connected malls (and the University of course), and offers the same stores with shameless repetition. There are limited stores which are not chains, so if you are visiting from anywhere in Canada this will not offer a unique shopping experience with few exceptions.

The food courts were however handy for quick bites.",3
Local Flavor,"Inside, it looks just like a mall. But what gives it its charm is that it's underground! I felt like I was exploring an underground city that thrived after some horrific disaster that occured above ground. For a few seconds, I thought 'Waterworld' meets ""Blast from the Past"". There really is no logic behind it, but that's what I felt, and what I feel is a result of my feelings. That makes sense.

There weren't many chain-retail stores (they were all above ground, those snooty bastids), mostly off brands and family-owned businesses. But browsing through mom-and-pop shops made me feel warm inside. Some of the shopowners tried their best to push merchandise, and I was a victim of their puppy-face guilt-trip sales pitches. But no worries, I needed another pair of faux-shearling-lined cowboy boots.",4
Local Flavor,"I guess I was a little disappointed, so I wouldn't want to get anyone else's hopes up.

Imagine half a dozen underground malls that are connected.  That is pretty much it.  If you enjoy food courts, and shopping all day without seeing daylight, then this might be your place.  But the shopping above is better, in my humble opinion.  And the food as well.

I don't find the underground as charming as I find it convenient, but if you like spending your day as a mole, then I think you'd like it here.  I have lived in Montreal for 6 months, and don't use if very often.

And yes, it is clean, and it is impressive how big it really is.  It is huge.",1
Local Flavor,"While I appreciate shiny things (they instantly distract me) and occasional refuge from the elements, I think there is something romantic about freezing your arse off walking outdoors and having to dust the snow off your noggin when you go into a shoppe. Maybe the whole underground mall thing just brings out my claustrophobic side if I think about it for too long, but all-in-all, I wasn't that wowed by this 18-mile retail explosion. Ask me again when I'm a geriatric, sporting a track suit.",2
Local Flavor,"First off - I found this place bloody difficult to find!  Maybe I just didn't understand the concept but I thought that I'd be able to zip down after a visit to the museum and at the point on my map where it said there was an entrance, I'd be able to pop underground.  Well, I spent nearly 2 hours looking for the ruddy place!  I was finally headed back to the hotel when, by lucky chance, I found an entrance!  Yay!!!

I was more interested in the Underground City as, well, an underground city than I was interested in it as a mall.  The concept fascinates me and I wanted to see what it was like.  But unfortunately, once you're in it you forget that you're underground and just feel like you're in a mall.  The concept still amazes me, and I'm glad that I checked it out (and I think that you should too if you're in Montreal) but I'm not sure if it would be someplace I'd make a point in putting on my itinerary again.

I can definitely see this being a benefit in the winter especially if you could use it as part of your commute so you could walk without having to trudge through the slush and freeze your toesies off!",3
Local Flavor,"Miles upon miles of relaxing (and potentially expensive) trots, skips and traversing await you in Montreal's underground city.

You can literally just get lost, not to mention really tired enjoying this very uniquely large area underneath the hustle and bustle above you. The underground city bridges many major buildings, universities, hotels, shops, restaurants, offices, even the metro.

It's always busy with people, brightly lit, impeccably clean, and is a safe haven from the wrath of mother nature. Although I will admit, I sometimes also love being in the open air as well.

The most impressive aspect, well to me at least, and other than the fact that the underground city stretches just shy of 20 miles, is the food court. It is quite an eye opener, offering every option that your hungry tummy can conjure up.

I obviously didn't come close to trekking the sub 20 miles but the food court alone is incentive enough to try.",3
Local Flavor,"A mole-like world...who knew, right?  Miles and miles of subterranean pathways and shopping, fountains, and plantlife (???) so that you can avoid the extreme weather of Montreal (very hot or very cold).  A very interesting place for one who doesn't live in Montreal.",4
Local Flavor,"La ville souterraine de Montréal est à voir au moins une fois dans sa vie, parce que bon, faut reconnaître c'est quand même quelque chose! La plus grande du monde quand même, ce n'est pas rien! Et puis il faut reconnaître que c'est quand même bien pratique l'hiver quand on se les gèle trop ou encore au printemps quand la pluie n'arrête plus de nous tremper les os. Généralement je navigue entre la partie Eaton et les Ailes qui est bien pratique et aussi pas trop compliquée à trouver. Bon certes, ce n'est pas la partie la plus jolie. Mais pour ça je vous recommande les visites guidées de la ville souterraine qui permettent de la découvrir  autrement que comme un simple (et gigantesque) centre d'achat. Parce que sinon, honnêtement c'est vraiment ce que c'est : des centaines et des centaines de boutiques qui s'alignent les unes derrières les autres... Pratique pour les courses de Noël donc, mais à éviter si vous êtes claustrophobe ou si vous n'avez pas le sens de l'orientation!!!",4
Local Flavor,"More like underground mall. There's nothing city about. It's a bunch of shops and places to eat, and just happens to be bellow ground. If you want a good mall, sure check it out. But if you're looking for something more, this is a waste of your time.",2
Local Flavor,"I think the most impressive part about RÉSO is its sheer magnitude. It's pretty much an underground mall that spans over 20 miles. If you're a shopaholic, this is the place for you. Otherwise, it's just a really, really, REALLY big mall. 

There are lots of great things to do and see in Montreal, but if you're looking for a way to kill 30 minutes or so - just enter RÉSO through one of its many entrances throughout the city and try not to get too lost.",3
Local Flavor,"This place is worth it especially in the middle of winter. It sure beats walking outside in the cold and wind freezing your butt off. 
A good way to get exercise too. It just goes on and on, mile after mile, store after store, metro to metro.

A fun way to explore Montreal in the winter.",4
Local Flavor,"I think I was expecting too much. I heard it was an underground city. If someone would have just told me it was mostly just an elaborate mall I think I would have had a more realistic idea of what I was walking into. 

If I lived here I think I would have a greater appreciation for being able to shop and walk around without having to step outside. However, I was here to see Montreal's sights and shopping centers don't really do it for me.",2
Local Flavor,"If it had better food and store selections, then I'd give it 3 or 4 stars. I was expecting more and was underwhelmed. Maybe I hyped it up in my head too much. I'm sure if I was there in the winter, I'd be seeking refuge there, but above ground in Montreal in the summer was too pretty to miss!",2
Local Flavor,"RESO definitely worth a solid 3 star if it is cold and freezing and snowing or raining outside... 

Great place to get lost... Gee, why am I going around in circle... I just want to walk South.... Don't follow me, I am lost!!

The stores can get a little boring if you are into shopping,,,.. I just want to have a break from the freezing cold

I end up just going back on the street... just walk South, a little cold but at least I find my way back to the hotel.",3
Local Flavor,"I was very fascinated by this place. The underground city is one continuous mall that spans 7 metro stations in the downtown area. Famous for its endless shops and boutiques and a sanctuary for those who seek to escape the unforgiving summer heat or the bitterness of winter, the underground city is an interesting way to get around the downtown area, great for grabbing some quick eats and window shopping some famous stores. Admittedly, it is very easy to get lost in here - once you've ducked into the maze that is the underground city, it's hard to tell where you'll end up. Although, there are semi-helpful signs posted everywhere to point to essential streets and metro stations to make sure you don't stray too far from your destination.",4
Local Flavor,"Why do people keep claiming this is an underground ""mall""? It's so much more than shopping. Tunnels connecting buildings (not to mention 7 metro stations on 2 lines), home to a winter art festival, keeps us warm in the cold winters...  this is a Montreal tourist attraction worth experiencing and a huge advantage for us locals who navigate downtown on a regular basis. 

There are some really interesting things down there. Check it out!",4
Local Flavor,I actually expected more... I don't know - maybe some flea markets? But this was literally an extended version of NYC's subway system - several tunnels leading to an entrance to either a subway or a mall...,3
Local Flavor,Love it! So glad to have somewhere warm to walk! But why do the stores close so early on weekends???,4
Local Flavor,This place is like a secret or something.  As I was walking down St Catherine St 5 people stopped me to ask me where this underground city is.  Underground City?  I want to go check it out!  Its basically  a mall with a subway.  Its cool!  I came here everyday just for the Paysane Gelato that they have here.  They earn 1 extra star for that.  Its good!,4
Local Flavor,"Why does everything list this as a top tourist attraction? It's a never ending maze of shopping malls. There's nothing interesting about it. If you want to shop, go for it, but you'll find the same stores as are in any US mall.",2
Local Flavor,"Pssst!  Where is the...""Underground City?""
Montreal's secret shopping paradise, 
often called the ""Underground Mall,"" 
is a MUST for shopping when it's cold out!

SHOPPING: Although it is a mall, of sorts, it offers 
SO much more than simply shopping. The underground city 
is one continuous group of tunnels that connects buildings 
to 7 metro stations in downtown Montreal Quebec. 
NOTE: It's easy for tourists to get lost down under,
despite the signs pointing to main streets and metro stations.

WEATHER: Canada suffers LONG, COLD WINTERS, 
and this Underground City is a world of warmth.
It's also a fun way to get around the downtown area.

DINING: The food courts here offer fabulous, fresh options, 
many of which can compete with the area restaurants.
You can even open a bottle of wine with your dinner.

THE DEAL:  Their winter art festival is also held here!",5
Local Flavor,"One of montreal's greatest accidental achivements.The city engineers felt it was to cold to go from office to depanneur (corner store)and built one passegway. Then another engineer thought that was cool and connected another passageway. Two more engineers got jealous and connected there own buildings underground. Then the next thing we know , all of downtown montreal has gone underground. 

 The really fun part of going underground is finding all these passagways.  In some places they are wide and clear as day. In other places they are only 3 feet wide. 
If you look hard enough , you will discover the Ice Rink, find the old prison for what is left of the old train station. (apparently it was Chinese who built the railway)
 The old montreal indoor  couryard .The Open air swimming pool. (bonaventure)
Now is a good time to really discover Montreal underground world.",5
Local Flavor,"A local's delight, a tourist's nightmare.

One late rainy Montreal afternoon, my family and I decided to play a little game of ""Lava Rain"". We started from the Place des Arts and challenged ourselves to stay underground all the way 'til Eaton. We may have cheated and followed employees passing through after work. We got halfway-ish to Place Bonadventure, where we were met with a choice of stairs, a tunnel to a restricted door, and a split level of escalators. I was like F-this and took to the sidewalks. Even with a map, it was confusing figuring out how to get back underground once we made it to the next building. Signage was minimal and not visitor friendly... it makes me wonder why is this on everyone's must-do list? We passed by fellow frustrated tourists wondering where all the action was. For a stretch, it's just tunnel. In other areas, you'll see some budget boutiques, people picking up at the dry cleaners, grabbing a bite in the food courts and stalls. Not much in the kitsch-factor, but a huge utility for locals. 

If I lived and worked near here, I'd probably have more of an appreciation for the Underground. For now, I'll stick to Montreal above ground.",2
Local Flavor,"This place was NOT marked well so anyone looking for it for the first, second, tenth time would've missed it! It was full of places to eat but dark and gloomy inside. Bathrooms were hidden down a dark lonely hall. I was forced to use the mens room since for some reason the womens room was pad locked with a punch code. I would recommend this place if it was snowing/raining and even then with detailed directions and a map you'd only find this if a rouge bus caused you to dive into an unmarked doorway on accident.",2
Local Flavor,"It's definitely not worth it for tourists with limited time to come here. We found the ice skating rink early on but couldn't find the actual shopping area for a solid, exhausting hour. The underground ""city"" is very spread out, and the shopping options, when you eventually find them, are the typical stores you can find in any mall in Mississauga (or you know, anywhere). 

The signage was very limited and unhelpful, and certain (non-Eaton centre) areas were pretty deserted on Sunday around 1pm. 

During our frustrating hunt, I opened up Yelp to see if others had tips on how to find the place and found several reviews mentioning that it is difficult for tourists to find. This is what I get for not checking Yelp first!",1
Local Flavor,"Te leíste mi reseña de Montreal y te dejé con la duda: ¿Que es la ciudad subterránea? ¿Acaso es como Sion en Matrix? ¿Vive gente allí?

Montreal es muy fría en invierno y hasta que inventen un domo o una máquina del clima tuvieron que hacer algo al respecto. Es una ciudad muy activa comercialmente y mucha gente de los suburbios va todos los días a trabajar allí, muy bien vestida como corresponde. Como no da arruinarte unos zapatos lindos con la nieve y sal estos ingeniosos canadienses construyeron toda una serie de túneles interconectados cubriendo una linda parte de la ciudad. 

Imaginate la remodelada Galería Obelisco Sur del subte, que cubre cuanto, ¿200 metros? Bueno, RÉSO, como se llama oficialmente, son 12 KILOMETROS y lo usan 500.000 personas a diario! Interconecta subte, tren, estacionamientos, empresas y organismos del gobierno que tienen una salida directa a ella. Podes incluso comer allí dado que tiene shoppings con patio de comida y todo.

Es una locura. Al principio te perdés un poco dado que la mayoría de las veces está todo en francés y es jodido tener sentido de dirección cuando estás bajo tierra, incluso confunde un poco COMO ENTRAR al RÉSO, dado que la mayoría de las entradas en la superficie están bastante ocultas para el que va por primera vez. Pero en mi segunda visita a Montreal, que arribé llegando en tren desde Ottawa, me sentía un local más y me fui hasta el hotel caminando por el RESO 10 cuadras, con la valijita, prácticamente sin salir afuera!

Desde ya está todo calefaccionado en invierno y con aire acondicionado en verano. Hay policías merodeando aunque medio al pedo porque en Montreal prácticamente no hay chorros. Baños limpio, muchos asientos para descansar, servicios de todo tipo. TODO.

Adoré. Ojalá acá en el microcentro tengamos algo así algún día.",5
Local Flavor,"I was amazed by the extent of this place. At first I thought it was just an underground shopping mall, but quickly realized that it's function was to cut out passage through surface streets altogether in the winter time. The large atriums let plenty of light in, even if you're subterranean. There are numerous food courts and plenty of good shopping. 

The passageways connect you to hotels, conference centers, subway stops, cultural centers. 

It's supposed to be 2 miles of passageways but feels longer. We walked all the way to one end, at the Westin to reach old Montreal without stepping outside. Amazing.",5
Local Flavor,"So I never know if I've walked the full ""underground"" city or not because I end up going up the stairs and being on the ground.  

While it's a great path for cold Montreal winters, it's kind of easy to get lost.  As for the stores, they aren't anything special.  They are your regular retail stores.  

I'm not sure it's worth a visit for tourists (especially in the summer) as I'd rather walk outside and see more people and get some sunshine.",3
Local Flavor,"St. Catherine Street (now officially rue Sainte-Catherine) is the main street for all your entertainment needs when you are in downtown Montreal. It is lined with so many places to shop, eat,learn and play.

Some highlights include H&M department store, Eaton Centre Mall, Dawson College, Mexx and Supersexe (one of the last remaining strip clubs). The street runs parallel to the largest segments of Montreal's underground city.",5
Local Flavor,"The unavoidable main artery of Montreal. For the real experience, ignore everything west of St. Laurent. It's a fairly generic downtown strip with the same stores you find everywhere else.  If you head east of St. Laurent, it's far more interesting. The sleazy vibe between St. Laurent and St. Denis is like pre-Giuliani Times Square where junkies, punks, and prostitutes still reign supreme. Anyone who, like myself, has some kind of misplaced and confused nostalgia for pre-gentrified and Disneyfied Midtown should check it out. Go while it's still there since they've been threatening to transform the area into a generic tourist trap with the Quartier des Spectacles.  Further east of St. Denis and it's the Village which is also a pretty interesting place worth checking out.",4
Local Flavor,"A shopping and restuarant street which largely resembles every other in a Canadian city. Don't be shocked to see the same stores over and over, or the same chains blocks from eachother. However, as a traveller it was a handy reference point and an easy go to.

I will note I believe it was called Christchurch Cathedral - it's across the Bay in any event - this is a gorgeous old cathedral which makes the walk down through the crowds totally worth it.",3
Local Flavor,"Crazy !!! Qué loco !!!! Enorme !!!


 La plus grande rue commerçante de Montréal mais surtout et ça, pour nous français, c'est assez incroyable et surprenant : il y a autant de magasins niveau rue que niveau souterrain !!! Et oui, avec de très basses températures l'hiver, nos cousins canadiens vivent ""sous terre"" !!! des km de galleries commerciales traversent la ville. Vou sortez du métro mais ne remontez jamais à la surface !!!


 Génial, des heures de shopping !!!!!",5
Local Flavor,"It may not be Oxford Street or Carnaby Street, but its still someplace that if you like shopping you'll want to check out.  For anyone else, it is a great central location where if you can find Rue Sainte-Catherine, you can find your way anyplace else in the city.

That's what I used it for.  Whilst I love shopping, these are the same stores that I can find anyplace else and so I used it more as a compass point to navigate the rest of the city.  I did like that the portion from Rue Berri to Rue Papineau is shut down to vehicular traffic and so becomes a pedestrian mall with restaurant patios spilling out onto the street and festivals taking over the road.  

Make this one of your first stops in the city if you're a tourist and you'll be able to find your way around just fine!",3
Local Flavor,"Avec St-Laurent, la rue Ste-Catherine est l'une des plus importantes artères de Montréal et donc l'un des must-see de la ville.
Contrairement à St-Laurent qui est plutôt orienté petites boutiques et échoppes, Ste-Catherine, elle, est clairement le domaine des grosses enseignes. Ainsi donc si vous cherchez un H&M, un Futureshop, Bedo ou autre Spirit et Levis stores, vous irez à Ste-Catherine Ouest. Idem pour les complexes tels que Desjardins, le centre Eaton, La Baie, les Ailes, etc. A noter aussi que cette partie de la rue est parallèle à la partie souterraine de Montréal, donc accessible en métro à plusieurs niveaux entre Place des Arts et Atwater. 
Le côté Est est ce que l'on appelle Le Village, le quartier gay de Montréal. C'est aussi une partie agréable à voir, moins orientée shopping, même si on y retrouve aussi quelques grosses enseignes. L'été cette partie là de la rue est entièrement piétonne et se transforme en une sorte de marché de plein air des plus plaisants.
Enfin, entre les deux, il y la partie de Ste-Catherine que j'aime le moins, celle qui se situe entre le boulevard St-Laurent et Berri-UQAM sur la rue St-Denis. On y rencontre trop de mendiants, marginaux et fêtards de la dernière heure à mon goût. Je n'ai jamais eu de problème jusqu'alors dans ce coin là, mais ça reste tout de même l'un des très rares spots où je ne sentirai pas tranquille si je m'y retrouvais seule le soir.",4
Local Flavor,"C'est l'endroit à faire lorsque vous visitez Montréal. 
Une rue super animée qui amène sur le quartier Gay... 
Il est plus drôle de s'y rendre la nuit, en particulier l'été.


 Un des lieux incontournable est le cabaret : chez Mado !",4
Local Flavor,"Uh, there are a lot of stores here. But seriously, the Apple Store ain't no better here than anywhere else. There are 3 ALDO shoe stores on this street, one in the Eaton mall and two others, like within a mile of each other.  The Eaton mall is ok, ain't nuthin special. As a tourist, I wouldn't waste more than an hour or 2 on St. Catherine St.  Go to Crescent or Rue. St. Laurent for nightlife or the old town.",3
Local Flavor,"Artère principale de Montreal pour le shopping, sorties et culture alternative. Tout se passe ici.

Assez sale au demeurant, on se croirait presque à Paris!

Local Flavor,"It's here, In this street that I spend lots of funny time during my trip ! lots of bar ! really cool stuff !",5
Local Flavor,"Looking for a Montreal experience? Look elsewhere- and I don't mean that in a bad way, I mean that in a matter-of-fact way.

Rue Sainte Catherine resembles a typical street in a typical downtown area in a typical city- with chain stores that you can find in the US and other places in Canada. Great place to go shopping as a local; as a tourist, visit your own version of Rue Sainte Catherine back home and spend that time at places that are unique to Montreal.",3
Local Flavor,"This street goes from ghetto, to somewhat less ghetto, to high end shopping, to low end shopping, to red light district, to shopping, to ghetto, to arts, to ghetto, to some unknown stretch!  Between one end to the other there are a bunch of restaurants scattered around.

One night I was walking down the street with a friend and one of the guys working the strip club doors ran up to us to ask us to go up to their strip club.  A guy working a couple of doors down at another strip club ran up to us and told us to skip the other guys club because all the girls have crabs.  I burst out laughing but my friend...she was grossed out and ran off.  

You'll find the same type of stretches on most big city main streets like pan handlers, sketchy people, restaurants and shopping and Rue Sainte-Catherine is no different but you won't get anything like what I mentioned above!",3
Local Flavor,"La rue sainte Catherine est LA rue pour faire du shopping, en fait c'est un des axes centraux de la ville. De ce fait il y a un grand nombre de restaurants, de boutiques en tout genres (H&M, AppleStore, Starbucks...). 

Cette rue est interminable donc si vous cherchez une boutique spécifique c'est préférable de regarder quelle station de métro est le plus prêt. Je pense qu'on peut y passer sa journée à faire les boutiques.",4
Local Flavor,"Pedestrian friendly.
On Ste. Catherine, you will find some of the most sought after restaurants, shopping areas. It's perhaps one of the busiest streets in Montreal with tons of street festivals, delicious restaurants, shops and boutiques. In a way, Ste. Catherine always reminded me of a mini-Fifth Avenue of New York and in a way - better, it has some of the unique labels from European brands that cannot be found easily in the States.",4
Local Flavor,"I'm not sure I understand some of the negative reviews here. Rue St. Catherine is very walk-able and while it has your typical retail stores, the food selection here is amazing.  You can access Centre-Eaton, a small Asian strip with Korean BBQ, sushi, dumplings, Chinese food and the like, Reuben's deli, Mister Steer, Juliette Chocolate, etc.  

What's great about this street is that the side streets such as Rue Peel, Rue Stanley, etc. all have their distinct identities as well.  

I think if you are looking for food options, this is the best street to go on.  It's also fun because of the hustle and bustle.

Personally, I love it.",4
Local Flavor,"Being raised in Montreal, I have great memories of walking up and down this street from every decade of my life.    The things you're looking for may change as you age but you'll always see something new or interesting.    Always great for people watching.",4
Local Flavor,"I mainly walked Rue Sainte-Catherine after seeing photos on Instagram of the Pink Balls which is in the Montréal Gay Village during the summer season. Seeing all of the photos online of it, I knew I had to see it in person during my one day in Montréal. 

I was pretty dumb because I somehow thought it was a short distance from my hotel (man was i wrong) I was staying at Delta Montréal and it was a good 6 km round trip (granted I wandered a little to take photographs of the art on the side of streets and buildings). 

Besides being a long walk, the display of the pink balls over Rue Sainte-Catherine is really unique and picturesque. The only downside was I would get a lot of people walking up to me talking to me in French - which I do not speak. Therefore I sort of got a little paranoid while walking because I was by myself and do not speak French. 

I didn't see many souvenir shops unfortunately and only spotted one along the Rue. Most of the road further down after you pass Quartier Des Spectacles - you come to an area surrounded by bars mainly and some restaurants which was nice to see along the route. 

Overall, I'd say it's worth to see the Pink Balls - then I'd see if you could head to Quartier Des Spectacles to see some music or what not since that was where most people were when I was in Montréal  that day.",4
Public Services & Government,"The long walk from the parking garage is irritating, but the spectacular new building brightened my spirits. The plush chairs in the waiting area and the intro movie with my favorite newscasters (Kim and Dana Wagner!!) helped ease my anger over Ms head-to-toe Ed Hardy who couldn't figure out how to mute her cell phone game, and Mr douche who wanted to be my new best friend sitting next to me. 

Then the day got even better (or so I thought), they needed 2 juries, so the other 50 or so of us weren't needed. Then the announcement that we would all have to sit in the waiting room until judges called saying they were completely finished choosing those 2 said juries came... my heart sank. The reserve jury?!??! I don't get to go home, I don't get to go into a courtroom and answer cool questions - damnit this was the worst of both worlds. At 4:30 our jury waiting room host FINALLY called the judges and they dismissed us. Could she have called at 2 or 2:30 to get this information?  Probably, but what's another 2 hours for these 50 poor schmucks on the reserve jury. 

Despite my anger about being on the ""reserve jury"", the overall experience wasn't all that bad. For jury duty, it is what it is. PS - they use the NV Energy database for calling potential jurors. Don't think you're safe from jury duty if you don't have a Nevada license. If you have power you're on the list! :)",4
Public Services & Government,"At 36 I finally got my very first Jury summons. I say finally because I have actually been looking forward to witnessing the justice system up close. My employer pays us 100% pay while on Jury duty, so even more of a reason to go! It is a long walk from the designated parking garage, especially in the 100+ degree temps. Going through security was equally as much fun. Ladies, If you tend to be a pack rat with your purse, change purses before you go! My purse and its entire contents were pulled out on display for everyone to see. The security guard stated that since my purse was packed so tight the xray machines couldn't see enough of the contents. The room was easy enough to find and the clerk was very patient and informative with the huge crowd. I ended up in a group of 98 that had to fill out a questionnaire. It took me about 30 minutes to do so and I was able to leave at around noon. 

The amenities inside the building seemed promising. I bought a pretty decent white mocha from the coffee shop and I saw that there was a Capriottis too.",3

It was a nice day and we decided to sit on the outside patio and enjoy the sun and people walking by.  

I had the sausage which was good.  My coworkers had a burger, a grouper fish and some spaghetti which was perfectly done.  

And we all had beer to wash it down.",4
Restaurants,"Great flat oven pizza!  Nice decor as well, very clean and new feeling.  Kid friendly without feeling like a family restaurant.  Lots of selection on the menu (of pizzas), so you will please everyone in the group!",5
Restaurants,"It was a Saturday around lunch time, my girlfriend and I sat down at a table outside. 
We were not in a rush by any standards.

You could tell that they were very much understaffed on the floor, because it looked like there was only one waitress running around trying to do everything. The restaurant was about 1/3 full.

We waited for about 10-15mins for our menus, it took us 5 minutes to choose what we would like to eat, and continued waiting for our waitress to stop by and take our order.

I am usually a patient person, but after another 15mins we decided to get up and leave. I was really hoping to try this place and what they offer, but 30mins before our order was even taken. Was enough for me.

Maybe next time",2
Restaurants,"So today we went back to Pizzadelic to give them another chance. They had to be about 5 tables besides us.

I had the Pizza which was good, my Girlfriend didn't really like her Calimari, she said it tasted reheated.

Everything was decent, the only thing that concerned me was that there was 3-4 tables that arrived after us who's order was taken after ours, and recieved there food before us.

As a client, seeing that can be a little concerning, and being someone who works in the restaurant industry, it's a big no, no.

There is other places i will choose, before i go back here.",2

This is never my 1st choice but when we do end up here I always love it.",4
Restaurants,"We ordered a calamari that tasted just ok the Cesar salad was nicely presented but the dressing was too oily and not tasty wasn't creamy enough Caesar salad is easy salad to serve but evrything is in the dressing the price don't matter if the food is good so I would say that salad was too pricy for what we got 
Service was just average the waitress was in hurry to conclude her order and didn't take the time with us too bad for her 15% overall I will not go back soon",2
Restaurants,"I used to come here with my girlfriend (now wife) back in the late 90's, but I don't know what has happened since - has my taste changed, has the resto had new owners? I don't know, but what was once a good experience has dried up and has blown away. First of all, the Jappy clientele are really annoying and grating to have to listen too while trying to unwind, but what can you do about that? Not the resto's fault, just another nail in the coffin for me though.
The server we had was alright, she did her job, but so indifferent and impersonal it was a little offensive. Every time she spoke to us, she would say something rehearsed, but pleasant, but never made eye contact. She would be gawking at another table, anything but us. Rude in any culture.
We ordered a pitcher of sangria - not hard to make. But it had little alcohol and was all ice cubes and obviously tasted like water - stale bar water. Returned it as it was $22 and got a little attitude for it. The pizza was alright. It cam on a mozza like bread and had very little toppings. The cheese was scarce as was the meat, and the taste was nothing to write home about. I had to drown it in the spicy oil they give you for it to be any good. It was an awful choice as it was a rare night out away from our daughter and we blew it here at this place. The bill was pretty steep for a pizza that probably cost them a dollar to make, so that was the last time we go to Pizzadelic. All the spicy oil in the world wouldn't make us go back.",1
Restaurants,If you are in Montreal and you need a small pizzeria with decent food than you might want to take a look at this place. It is pretty small and dark so if I were you I would sit on the terrace if there's room. The service isn't bad and it does not take too long for the food to arrive. The fries there are great as well as the mayo they serve with it. The salad is also pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of the pizza there however that is my opinion. The rest of the dishes are nothing special. Overall it's a nice little place to have a quick meal if youre in the area.,3
Restaurants,"went for lunch... chose it because it was open and less expensive than a few places bearby.
Overall OK. .. but not a destination resto. 

 My younger friend liked her pasta and her mother seemed to enjoy her pizza. I however was not a fan. I ordered a pizza with chevre and nuts that did not list tomato sauce. I have a mild allergy to tomato and do not always wish to enjoy post meal itchies.  The pizza came with sliced tomato on it. OK it was in part my fault for assuming that they would not add ingredients not listed on the menu...but tomatoes can be scrapped off. More disappointing was the crust. It tasted like it had been frozen and had very little to recommend it. I imagine it would taste much like cardboard-if I knew what cardboard was like to eat. Toppings (goat cheese and nuts) were sparse - I guess that is why they added the tomato slices - they did make it look like there was something on the pizza. 

Our waitress was lovely and very good. My friends both enjoyed their plates. So they lose stars on my food... but make them back up with my friends enjoying themselves and efficient wait staff. 

Can't recommend it as anything more than a slightly-overpriced-for-what-it-is-trying-to-be-better-than-what-it-is place to fill up.",2
Restaurants,Decent place to go for pizza and drinks. Service is usually pretty good. Their penne rose is sneaky good though.,3
Local Flavor,"I love stopping over at this pretty area on South Tryon. With fountains going, pretty sculptures that appear to be dancing in them, and tables peppered throughout that invite you to take a breather, this place is very relaxing. 

If eating at Mimosa Grille, you can ask to be seated outside to enjoy this oasis in Uptown Charlotte at night. It is even more beautiful then, with the trees lit up and without the hustle and bustle of the workweek. If you are just stopping through, there are plenty of places for you to relax and catch your breath, including the ""upstairs"" area - you can climb the flight of stairs and get a birds eye view of S. Tryon while enjoying a book or a sandwhich, or just a quiet moment. The Plaza adds a nice touch to Uptown.",4
Local Flavor,"This is a really special area uptown. I like to get food and hang out there to eat. It's good for coffee breaks or lunch breaks or really any kind of break. 

There's something special about a park in the middle of a city. Parks are nice anywhere, but these little spots in the middle of a concrete jungle where you can rest, listen to some water, and watch the people hustling by really can seem like an oasis. It's worth finding parking uptown just to go hang out and listen to the waterfalls.",5
Local Flavor,"Surprisingly enough, Charlotte really does not have a shortage of open space uptown.  What may come as a surprise to most people not from Charlotte is that what we in the QC dub as a park is what other people might call a big slab of concrete.

Marshall Park?  Decent amount of greenery, some trees, and even a semi-polluted lake, but covered with parking lots and surrounded by busy streets. One of the coolest parks is Thomas Polk park uptown - but it just has planters sprouting out of the sidewalk and some waterfalls amongst the trees.   Until recently, even the latest ""jewel"" in the city, Sugar Creek, was entirely covered - for decades no less!

So it probably does not surprise you that this plaza, while water and a few trees can be found, is mostly: Concrete.  That is just the way it is here, visitors.  Get used to it.  Want green?  You can go to The Green, but most of what you will find uptown is gray.  Still, this is a decent space.  I have not seen any of their movies on the wall for probably a decade or more, but it is a nice gathering spot, even if it does suck in heat like you would not believe.",4
Local Flavor,"I, like Stephen, have a difficult time labeling this a park. There isn't any greenspace or grass yet it's a solid meeting space with some relaxing components. 

If you meander into this stone area you'll find a pretty waterfall, plenty of seating and, if you're there around lunch, many a hot dog vendor. I personally appreciate this space much more when it's not so crowded, but hey - different strokes I guess. 

On the weekends when Uptown is fairly quiet this plaza is tops. Grab some coffee, hang out and watch the very few people walk by. If you're lucky you may even spot the handful of colorful homeless folk who love to tell you the world is going to end.",4
Local Flavor,"What a divine space to relax, get some sun on your shoulders, and watch the busy worker bees fly past!  The seating is ample, the atmosphere is lighthearted and breezy, and the people watching is top notch.  Gets crowded on those breezy spring/early summer days, but it's more than worth it to grab some fresh air and get away from your desk.  

Personally, I prefer the Green to the Plaza, but it's basically the same thing, just with less green stuff.  And seriously, people watching.  I saw a dude walk by with a teal bowtie on.  TEAL!",4
Local Flavor,"If you have never been, this is the coolest thing EVER! 
Every Sunday, starting about noon, many gather at the base of Mt Royal, (Mt Royal Park, Rue Sherbrooke) to drum, dance, and unify as one. 

From May to September drummers, and dancers of all ages, genders, cultural backgrounds all come to drum and dance. 
At the STATUE. 

I have seen hippies and gay leather guys, elderly woman, a handicapped child in a wheelchair with his father, they all drum to the beat which changes to a leader with a WHISTLE which goes fast to slow INTENSE to faint.

Vendors come to sell incense and wares of pottery and jewelry or tie dye tee-shirts. 
Local people come with their DOGS to play frisbee or DANCE to the BEAT. 

Tourists come curious as to what this drumming is all about? 
Some take photos and smile in amazement and hope that they can take some of this wonderful community energy back to their home. 

This is all FREE and FUN to all who visit Montreal please COME and check out this cool and special event as local flavor like this is hard to find ANYWHERE else.

It is BOYD (Bring your own drum).",5
Local Flavor,"Very colorful, especially if you want to smoke weed surrounded by a bunch of weirdos playing African drums...other than that it is rather boring",3
Local Flavor,"I expected something bigger.  Even so, it was a good time looking though all the vendors and listening to the drumming and watching the dancing.  Really, I could have done with just the vendors...

Unfortunately, I thought that there was more cash in my wallet =(  With only $15, I had to choose my purchase carefully.  There was homemade jewelry including these very lovely wooden rings, bracelets, and necklaces, and plenty of clothes.  Many of the clothes had been imported from India but there were some that had been made by the vendor and I saw more than one dress that I would have liked to have had.  The prices were reasonable but with my limited cash reserve I had to show restraint!

I decided to buy something for a gift rather than for myself and I think I got a deal at $15 but I won't put what I got here in case the recipient reads this review =)

I've looked at many of the pictures that others have posted and I just wonder why there weren't more people there the Sunday I went... Was it too hot?  World Cup final in a few hours?  I don't know.  But there probably weren't more than 20 drummers and many 50 people watching.",3
Local Flavor,"Tam Tams is my favorite thing to do on a Sunday afternoon. 

At the bottom of Mont Royal there are vendors everywhere selling jewelry, art, clothing and pipes for good prices. 

In the middle of the mountain are tam tam circles, dancing and people carrying on. There are also pockets of the mountain where people throw around frisbees, play hacky-sack, nap, smoke weed and drink.

It's a mix of people- families, friends, students, D&D nerds, stoners, people with their hookahs and hippies but everyone seems to mesh pretty well. It's like everyone goes there with the intention of having a good time so people are friendly and inviting.

And at the top of the mountain are people playing soccer and D&D nerds engaging in combat- love it!

I love to throw down a blanket, eat and drink then take a nap. It's such a great time.",5
Local Flavor,Super fun every time! I love sitting back and people watching and there are plenty of people to watch! It's a very 420 friendly gathering.,5
Local Flavor,"What a great time here! Lots of talented people just banging on the drums. No practice just join in and go with the flow. The tam tam is located in a fun park that has hiking, biking and other types of shows.",5
Local Flavor,"Check with the locals for the location, the map is wrong.  The 'Tam Tam' is located at the base of 'Mount Royal'. I got upset at my wife becoz of the incorrect info.  It's worth seeing, we caught the bus to st viateur's fairmont bagel after. Excellent bagels, especially when they're hot.",3
Local Flavor,"5 stars under the ""Awesome for what it is"" policy. On a rolling patch of green stretching east down ""the mountain"" every Sunday a uniquely Montreal happening unfolds. Across an area the size of several football fields loosely centered around the iconic George-Étienne Cartier Monument a crowd of 200 to 5000+ assembles. Some are families with picnic blankets, some are students with frisbees, some are artisan vendors with permits to layout their hemp necklaces and other quirky goods for sale along the walkways. There are always drums, sometimes two or three different circles, sometimes they all converge. Anyone can come and join in, there are players of all ages and experiences and the rhythm throughout the day is a kind of organic, anarchic happy flow. Tripped out hippies form dance circles around the drummers and brave tourists let themselves get caught up as well. 

There is marijuana in the air throughout, which Montrealers are used to, but for tourists, don't worry, be happy! It's a happy, sunny, funny scene with people of all kinds. There is nothing spectacular to see here, just a Sunday afternoon in a park. But if you like to daydream while people-watching to pulsing rhythms on a green hill, you will enjoy this. Don't miss the circus artists who usually practice a little ways a way from the crowds, or the medieval warriors who are especially witty during election season with their shields made out of campaign posters.",5
Local Flavor,"Bring a blanket, a bottle of wine, and just enjoy. I usually get antsy just sitting in a park, but maybe it's consistent hum of drums in the background and the second hand smell of pot, but this is one of the few parks I can really just sit and relax. Go on Sunday, and I recommend sitting on the northern part of the park where it is a little less busy and more shaded. A fun Montreal experience! Fun to watch a variety of people, ranging from 18 year old McGiill students to bohemian couples smoking a dube while they watch their child doing cartwheels.",5
Local Flavor,"Quand il fait beau et chaud, les Tams Tams au Mont Royal sont une expérience à ne pas manquer. Parfait pour faire la fête en pleine journée, se remettre d'un lendemain de veille et laisser le hippie en soi sortir! Emmenez vos panier de pique-nique, une couverte, de la crème solaire et laisser le rythme des tams-tams vous emportez. En peu de temps, on se sent comme une grosse famille qui a décidé de faire sa fête annuelle et tout le monde y est invité. On s'amuse, on relaxe, on y profite des longues journées d'été. Simple, pas cher (même gratuits si nos bons amis s'occupe du pique-nique!) et ouvert à absolument tout le monde, de tous les âges, et surtout, de tous les genres!",5
Local Flavor,"I try to bike up the mountain as much as possible and everytime i do it it's a challenge, a challenge i never ever backdown from. Enjoy!!",5
Local Flavor,"A gathering of a group of strangers to improv music, celebrate and just have fun - this is what Tam Tam is. If you have a free Sunday summer morning in Montreal, stroll by the famous Parc du Mont Royal and follow the sound of enthusiastic drumming, and you'll find a circle of people around the Monument to Sir George-Etienne Cartier, holding their own preference of drums, who come together to display their passion for music while encouraging others to dance. All of their beats are improvised and started by one of two musicians, while the others follow suite. The spirit and vibrate character of Montreal artisans in its full force.",5
Local Flavor,"Haha I was really hoping I could review tams and I can - best day ever! For reals though, look at these five stars splattered across this page - everyone loves it!! It is eclectic and crazy - to find your friends you have to say things like, ""I am next to the third slack line... no no, closer to the LARPers... yeah, by the guy with the swing in the big tree!"" This is why tam tams is so awesome - it brings out the eccentric in everyone all in the middle of the city to the beat of drums all day long (believe me, all day, as I live close by and those drums will go til midnight on sundays!). Go there, bring some smoked salmon, bagels and cream cheese and have a picnic. And bring alcohol, because your in Quebec and you can!!",5
Local Flavor,"Imaginez-vous: soleil, nature, grand espace, joie mêlé au son des Tam Tam, apéro entre amis... Vous visualiez? Et bien, les dimanches Tam Tam sont à découvrir, car ils font partie intégrante de Montréal!
Certes, à cette occasion la vue et l'ouïe sont très stimulés, mais l'odorat l'est également... Que ce soit par les BBQ ou encore par la fumée de certaines substances. Vous constaterez par vous-mêmes!",5
Local Flavor,"On Sunday morning we went and got Montreal bagels and then walked to this park...it's a bit of a hike, but the weather was nice...to see the tam-tams!
My sister had really hyped the tam-tams to me, so I went in a bit skeptical....but she was right! 

I can't really explain why this was so fantastic, especially because really it's a bit ridiculous. 

This is a big park and I don't know it well enough to direct people to where exactly you need to go, but by the large monument (the one featured on the picture for this attraction), you will find a group of drummers that set up here every Sunday. Depending on the day, there may be more, or less. Apparently the group can get pretty huge, but either way, they all gather around in a sort of circle...and drum! 

The environment is very ""come-as-you-are"" (read: hippy), but it's such a laid back and accepting atmosphere. The drummers just sort of jam together, playing all sorts of different types of drums and bongos. People go and dance in the middle...kids go and pound on the drums...lots of people get high! 

Even not high, this is a pretty fun thing to watch. It's mesmerizing somehow. Again, I can't explain what made this so great. We just sat back in the beautiful weather, snacked on our bagels and watched the craziness unfold around us. 

It was so unique and so weird....but so musical...it was just cool to be a part of it!",5
Local Flavor,"Oh, it's silly. Honestly the drums aren't even half of it, although it's fun to listen to. There's a certain democratic spirit that allows the weaker timekeepers to meld together with the better ones; the groove never stays in place for more than 30 seconds at a time, and it doesn't matter. Shout-out to the arts & crafts hustlers, the ice cream guys, and especially the... shall we say, ""ruthlessly cold-calling"" weed dealers. Bring beers and maybe a bag of chips or something and sit back to enjoy the ride, whatever--you've earned it. Come with friends. It's quite a scene.",5
Local Flavor,"Tam Tams is hands down one of my favorite Montreal ""community"" events...Every Sunday during the summer, hundreds of Montrealers gather to sit on the mountain while taking in the sun, picnicking, throwing a frisbee/football around, or just people watch. It is one of the most entertaining things to do on a lazy Sunday..And what makes it even better is the awesome drum circle that makes you want to dance your face off in the warm sunshine. 

There's really no way one can regret checking it out.. Just beware, if you have kids, that there's usually lots and lots of marijuana in the air on these days. People keep to themselves about it and no one makes a fuss, but if you have kids, I'd understand not wanting to bring them around! Otherwise, awesome vibe and definitely a good excuse to get your dose of Vitamin D! :p",5
Local Flavor,"C'est dimanche, il fait beau, il fait chaud et t'as rien à faire ? Pas le choix de se rendre aux tamtams du Mont-Royal dans ce cas ! 

Tout d'abord, c'est une expérience à faire, et c'est le moment parfait pour se poser tranquillement pour un picnik au rythme des tamtams et faire une petite bronzette entre amis ! Il y a des gens de tous genres et de tous âges, sympathiques et certains nous propose de taper sur leurs tamtams, puis on danse, on fait la fête en plein air ! 

C'est aussi le moment où la communauté hippie est de sortie, ce sont les principaux animateurs de cet événement, c'est amusant de voir leur façon de bouger, de danser et de se vêtir ! 

De plus, certaines personnes viennent vendre des bijoux et colliers faits à la main, ils font quelques belles choses ! 

C'est dimanche?! Prends ta serviette, tes lunettes de soleil, crème solaire et paniers à picnic, la formule parfaite pour une belle journée entre amis !",5
Local Flavor,"Nous sommes le 10 août, il est 15h, je viens de déposer mes affaires à l'auberge de jeunesse, je sors de la chambre et là 2 allemands, 1 français, 1 australienne, 1 suisse et 2 québécois se jettent sur moi en me disant: 
- ""tu es nouvelle?""
- oui
- ""on t'embarque alors c'est dimanche et tous les dimanches que tu sois touriste ou québécoise tu dois aller au tam-tam!""
- et ba ok.
Et me voilà en train de marcher vers ce rassemblement ayant lieu tous les dimanches qui est d'après ce que j'ai compris le rendez-vous montréalais à ne manquer sous aucun prétexte!!!! 

De loin, j'aperçois des jongleurs et 1 homme faisant des acrobaties avec du feu (assez impressionnant), plus on s'approche et plus j'entends le son de ce que je crois être des tamtam. En arrivant plus près je vois des tam tam et des gens qui tapent sur plusieurs choses pour faire du bruit et se mêler aux bruits des tam tam. Ils tapent sur des canettes de bière, le dos d'une guitare, des bouteilles d'eau en plastique..... Et au milieu de tout ça une bonne vingtaine de personne en train de danser sur ces rythmes. 

Niveau look on en a un peu plein la vue, ça va des hippies aux baba-cool, des jeunes aux plus anciens, des tatoués aux touristes ..... Enfin tout le monde quoi. 

Petite précision: normalement boire de l'alcool en dehors de chez soi ou a l'extérieur des bars est illégal au Québec mais toléré lors de rassemblement comme celui-là. Bref c'est une expérience que j'ai beaucoup apprécié et que je recommande a toutes les personnes se rendant à Montréal.",4
Local Flavor,"A must see event if you're in Montreal on a Sunday. You'll love the feeling you get losing yourself in the music and dancing... or maybe that's just a contact high. It definitely feels like a step back into the 60's with the barefoot dancing, hempen clothing, smell of marijuana, Hare Krishnas, and all.

If you like people watching, this is definitely a place to go. Hippies and squares alike can come together in enjoyment of a pleasant afternoon and dance to the music. Maybe try your hand (foot?) at slack line walking, if you're brave try the free cookies from the Hare Krishnas, check out the many wares people sell - mostly jewelry, clothing, pipes and other tchotchkes.

Downsides: I didn't see any facilities (not that I think one could accommodate the hundreds of people present) and as a result, a number of people took care of business in the wooded area. There is also a good bit of second-hand smoke (tobacco and pot) floating around, so if you're sensitive to that or are concerned about your children being near that, maybe enjoy from afar.

Easy to find/hear from the area surrounding east Mont Royal. If walking's a bit much for you, the #11 bus will take you there from Mont-Royal Metro.

Definitely check this out on Sundays!",4
Local Flavor,"During the summer, during afternoon sundays this is the place to be. In winter except drug dealers, joggers and the Montreal beer runners no one goes there, or almost no one.
In the Summer this is like the heart beat of Montreal you will find drum circle, arts and crafts people, mid evil warriors (there is an RD&D area above the tam-tams), acrobats (a little above the statue doing slack line, juggling and other amazing things) and of course the majority of the people relaxing in the sun like turtles trying to absorb the summer heat and enjoy life",4
Local Flavor,"L'été, les dimanches, les TamTam animent le bas de la montagne, au bout de la rue Rachel
C'est super, il y a toujours beaucoup de monde, tout le monde chill, mange, fume, boit, tranquille relax!!!
Allez y faire un tour au moins une fois, entre amis, ça vaut la peine!! :)",4
Local Flavor,"Dimanche easily takes the crown as my favorite day of the week during the warmer months in Montreal. Why, you ask? For the Tam Tams of course! Embrace the Bohemian life, if only for just a few hours. 

Here is my secret formula to carpe diem, Ville-Marie style:

1. Wake & bake, then twist up a few for the days adventures.
2. Shower to cleanse your Saturday sins.
4. Rotisserie Romados for the poulet combo, to go. A savory lunch, indeed. Some vin if you so please.
5. Walk/bike/bus/skateboard to the treasure that is Mt. Royal and Cartier Monument. Don't drive, there will be no parking around. Uber if you must.

Roll out the blanket, pop a bottle, light up a spliff and immerse yourself into the display of many artists, ethnicities, social backgrounds, students, travelers and locals banding together in utter beauty to create sounds that capture and seep into your soul. 

There is no before, there is no after. You are entrenched in the present, allowing your senses the honor to witness the gift of what life is about: unity of all amongst life's chaos.

Public Services & Government,"I've only ever ridden on the Lynx light rail system, so I can't speak to the other stuff CATS has to offer. But if you're looking to hop a ride uptown for the night, then Lynx is a great option if you live near it.

The Lynx is pretty new to Charlotte, only a year or so old, & it's quite popular. If you work uptown & you're looking for a place to live, then living close to the Lynx is a great idea. Also, if you're just heading out uptown for the night, this is a great way to find a cheap way to & from home to the bars. You don't have to worry about driving home after a few drinks, & it's much cheaper than a taxi.

There is so much great stuff along the Lynx line other than just uptown too, with plenty of shops & restaurants within walking distance of the Lynx stations.

If I were to move to Charlotte, I would definitely try to find a place along the Lynx light rail to live. While you may pay a little more for a place along the line, you'll spend less in gas as you only have to pay for the cheap ride on the light rail. This is a great addition to Charlotte & a great way to get around the city.",4
Public Services & Government,"I'm a pretty big fan of the light rail. In just a year, it's become extremely popular. Tons of people use it to commute to work or to go out uptown. I take the light rail every time I'm going to a Bobcats game or event uptown. Why drive and pay $10 or $20 to park when you can have a designated driver for just $3 roundtrip? If you're taking the rail, allow for plenty of time to buy a ticket. The platforms don't have enough machines and you'll likely have to wait in line to purchase a ticket. Lynx is still so new that the cars are clean and quiet. 

The bus system, on the other hand, is not as pleasant. I've taken the bus to work before and never really enjoy the experience. The bus has become more and more crowded as gas prices have skyrocketed. The routes are also set up in such a way that it's hard to transfer. You often have to go back to the uptown transit center to transfer.",4
Public Services & Government,"Last night was my first trip on the light rail and I have to say, I am impressed. The trains are frequent and comfortable, the parking (at the Woodlawn station) is plentiful and well lit, and for a $3 round trip, it can not be beat.

My ticket was carefully checked by an inspector, so make sure you buy one from the automated machine before boarding. You can not buy a ticket on the train and the fine is steep!

I'm not sure why someone would say ""Filth"" about the Lynx, as the trains I rode were very clean. Drinking, eating and smoking are not permitted. Having ridden the MARTA in Atlanta, the METRO in Washington and the London Underground to compare, Charlotte's system is excellent. There's only the one route (Ballantyne to Uptown) but it does what it advertises - easy transportation from South Charlotte into the city.

Four stars... I'm a fan!",4
Public Services & Government,"I have been getting around Charlotte using CATS, because I want to do the responsible thing and refrain from driving until I can do so without being completely dependent on a GPS (and therefore completely distracted by my phone's map program).  I have been able to get anywhere I want to go using the train and buses.  Maybe this is because my needs aren't too high, but I can get to food, shopping, museums and the various Charlotte area schools at which I may work.  It's been pretty clean and the bus drivers have all been fairly helpful and friendly.  I guess I should mention that I am fairly walking-tolerant, so it doesn't bother me to have to walk several blocks to a bus.  I also have a high tolerance for shady-but-not-dangerous, so that might tint my vision as well.
The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because the buses and LYNX do not run very often.  Now, being used to transit in a poorly served area in Chicago, I have a fairly high tolerance for bus-waiting, but I have also been in well served areas of Chicago and know that things could be better, even here in car lovin' Charlotte.  I hope CATS can get whatever funding it needs to expand the LYNX and maybe even run some more buses/trolleys, because it's got promise.",4
Public Services & Government,"One thing I miss about Charlotte: the public transportation system. Especially the light rail. 

The last two years I lived in Charlotte I used the CATS bus to ride to/from work, eliminating many miles on my car and quite a few traffic headaches. (I DON'T miss Charlotte traffic. Thank goodness Raleigh has no traffic.)  The light rail was great for getting to/from uptown (as long as you were somewhere south), Panthers games, from the VW dealership to work, etc. The fares are extremely reasonable, and the buses and light rail are clean. Parking at the station lots is free, and the City does a great job of helping the traffic of patrons for the Wells Fargo Championship in early May. 

The downsides are that the light rail doesn't go far enough -- it needs to be more like the Metro system of Washington, D.C. by going out to University City, down to Union County, up to the Birkdale area, and over to the airport. Also, it cost WAY too much taxpayer money for no longer than the track currently is.",4
Public Services & Government,"I'm a big fan of the light rail system.  I just wish they could build it faster!  Sometimes I catch myself just finding an excuse to ride the train into downtown.  Sure it takes extra time to catch it... but it sure beats trying to find a parking deck, paying, road rage, etc.

My office use to me downtown so I would ride the express bus from Matthews in the mornings and afternoons.  Man I miss it - having that extra 15-20min of sleeping time was great since the express buses are nice and plush.  The way that CATS has the express buses set up is that it picks up its riders and then there's a straight shot downtown.

I've tried using the express buses in the mornings now, but my commute is 1hr if I do that (I have to make a connection in the downtown terminal).  Still it beats driving though.

In my book, Charlotte has undergone many changes through the years and the transportation system is just one of the many ""nice"" features the city can be recognized for.  Can't wait to see what the system looks like in 10-20 more years.",4
Public Services & Government,"Save the planet, go mass transit, right? While this review is solely based on the Lynx light rail system, I know plenty of folks who appreciate and depend on the CATS bus system too. 

I live only a few blocks from two of the South End light rail stations and I really appreciate it. Hubs and I often spend the affordable $1.50 to hit up Uptown and avoid the sometimes irritating parking dance in Center City. The rail itself is quick, clean and easy and purchasing tickets is a total cinch via the ticket stands. 

My only minor gripes? For one, the rail doesn't run quite as often as I'd  like. During off times expect to wait up to 20 minutes between trains...which, if you tend to run a bit late, like me, an additional 20 minutes can make you uber late. Oops. Plus, the light rail doesn't run super late on the weekends; I believe the last outbound run is around 1 am, which is late for me, but not for some folks who stay out all hours at EpiCentre.  

It goes without being said, but I would use the light rail even more if they extended it to other areas of Charlotte. Here's hoping that comes to fruition in a reasonable amount of time!",4
Public Services & Government,"I've been taking the light rail uptown to work for 2 and a half years, and all in all, I think it's a good system. It does need to be improved, but it is a good addition to the city, and I can't wait until they expand it so I can use it to get to more places. 

Positives:
-Convenience. I happen to live close to a station and work close to a station, so it doesn't get any easier than that. Even if you don't happen to live near a station, there are several Park & Ride stations for you to leave your car and take the train uptown for a night out, a performance, or a game. 
-In general, the trains are clean, well-kept, well-lit, and not too crowded. I feel safe taking it and waiting by myself at the stations.
-For the most part the trains run on-schedule at reasonable intervals. 

Room for improvement:
-The stations provide absolutely no weather coverage. Have you ever missed your train? Because I have more times than I'd like to admit, and have been stuck waiting for the next one in the rain. Yes, I was under the awning, but the awning doesn't do anything. Even the large covering at the Uptown CATS station leaves much to be desired. 
-The trains need to run later hours, at the very least on the weekend. This is not just for the party crowd either. I work in a restaurant that closes at 11 on the weekends, and sometimes servers don't get out until almost 2 am, especially if they're closing. Sucks for you if the last train left at 1 am. There are groups of people besides the 9-to-5ers that depend on the CATS system to work the night shift.
-Trains need to be scheduled better when there are events uptown. Panthers game? Concert at Time Warner? Street festival? SCHEDULE MORE TRAINS. And run a double-length instead of a single-length. I have seen a little bit of effort regarding this, but many a time I am just trying to get home from work and get stuck behind 7,000 kids who just got out of Disney on Ice (see my review for Vida Cantina.)",3
Public Services & Government,"I never thought I would be a public transportation kind of girl but Charlotte turned me into one. After moving to Ballantyne, I had to find a more convenient way to get Uptown in a decent amount of time without the possibility of road rage and there was CATS. CATS offers over 70 bus and rail routes and even offers Express lines to surrounding counties and throughout South and North Charlotte. I used to take the Rea Road Express which ran about every 30-40 minutes between 6A-9A and 4-7P. The first time on the bus I was nervous-do I smile, make eye contact , keep to myself? Most of the people on it were business people going Uptown and after riding for a month, got to know them on a one on one basis. I could read, check emails and listen to my iPod (or occasionally take a nap but if you do this, set an alarm or be sure someone wakes you up). Pleasant experience in my three years of riding for the most part and it took about 40 mins to get Uptown from Rea and 485. Nice people, cushioned seats and only a few times of standing room only on the bus (around the time we ran out of gas in Charlotte). My only gripes were that I wish they had longer hours available for the Express lines and ran on weekends. Now that I think about it is another major gripe was that on the way to work or going home from work, if the bus was ahead of schedule it would sit on the side of the road for a few minutes until it was back on schedule and that didn't sit well with me. I'm trying to get somewhere CATS---take me there who cares if you're ahead of schedule? I moved to Dilworth and started riding the local Selwyn route which was ok---it ran more frequently throughout the day, convenient stops in Uptown however it didn't have the cushioned seats I had grown accustomed to and my booty didn't like that. The main issue is that all the lines seem to go directly to and from the Uptown Transportation Center (which I so affectionately call The Blvd of Broken Dreams--everyone looks super sad to be there) and could use more lines going throughout town (i.e. on 51 or Tyvola) 

Light Rail is a good concept however with one line down to South and 485, it really isn't convenient to a major chunk of the Charlotte population. If we were to have a light rail system like Portland where they have multiple lines going to the city and other areas from the airport, we could be so much more. Light Rail is packed on game days and late night with people heading from Uptown and always provides good people watching experience (like one dude who was rapping about KFC and Jesus-who knew those two were even so closely related?) When I've been on, it's been an ok experience but think they should run it an hour later to correlate with the hours of bars closing. Worrying about catching the last train while trying to enjoy an adult beverage isn't exactly a happy thought. From what I've heard about in other cities, we have a pretty nice public transportation system. Take a chance ......and a ride on CATS---our tax dollars are going to it so why not?!",4
Public Services & Government,"I am a huge fan of the Light Rail.  I mean, how can you really beat a $1.50 for a ride?  The train cars are clean and they run just about every 7 mins during peak hours.  They even have sections to store your bike if you need to.  I just would like for it to travel at a faster speed.  Thats all.  It stops right at the Epicenter and Bobcats arena.  Jackpot!

PS.  Im not sure if the Gold Rush Trolley falls under CATS but that is pretty sweet too.  Free shuttle around uptown!!  Niiiiiiiiice.

-Ian M.",4
Public Services & Government,"With gas prices increasing, and rush hour traffic being worse than ever, I take the express bus from Huntersville to uptown almost every day. For $2.40 or $2 if you buy a 10 ride pass from local supermarkets, I get a nonstop ride and dropped off 2 blocks from work. There are express buses from Mooresville, Cornelius, Huntersville, Concord, University(I believe,) and even Rock Hill. These are nice buses too, nice seats with overhead lights for that early morning book reading and well air conditioned. Do yourself a favor---find your local park and ride, go to CATS homepage and find your bus schedule, and save yourself some $$ and help clear the roads.  Buses run every 30 minutes or so in the AM, every hour during the day, and about every 15 min-30 min during go home time(3pm-6ish).  I believe they run until about 8pm.  Nice for that after work nap during the ride back to the park and ride too. =)",4
Public Services & Government,"In light of the gas prices being out of control and the fact that parking uptown is ridiculously expensive, I started riding the Express bus a few years ago and still purchase 10-ride passes pre-tax each month (as they are cheaper then the monthly pass and better for me as I work from home a couple of days a week and don't use the bus on the weekends). 

I really enjoy the ease with which I'm able to catch the bus a mile from my house, then totally zone out, nap (it's true), catch up on some work or read a book/magazine while someone else takes care of the driving. And the Express bus is clean, has fewer stops, and drops me two blocks from my office. In terms of cost, the Express bus is a bit more expensive then the city bus, but totally worth the time saved; I don't mind paying a bit more for less stops, the commuter clientele and cushy seats.

As the Express bus only runs during peak commuting times, I've had to take the city bus twice, and would still give that three stars. And I've had the opportunity to use the light rail as well, which seems to be relatively busy at all times of the day (and night)...but is also delightful. All CATS options offer a place to store your bike onboard while riding, which is a nice perk.

If you're trying to go-green (or save some), I highly recommend checking into CATS.   With a minimal amount of effort, you could make your commute a much more pleasant experience.",4

Public Services & Government,"I love the bus.  No doubt about it.  I catch the 77X from H-ville to and from work and love the option to work, sleep, read, play angry birds, write Yelp reviews, etc. during my commute.  So totally relaxing vs. fighting that traffic in my car.  Not paying for parking, gas, wear and tear on the vehicle?  No brainer.

I'd give 5 stars if there were rail that made its way up here to the hinterlands.  Look forward to that day!",4
Public Services & Government,"In the east end of downtown Charlotte, this place is in a very good location.  It's mainly for the public transportation system.  It's also really close to different venues in the area.",3
Public Services & Government,"I love the lightrail.  I'm one of the lucky south Charlotte individuals who benefit from this service.  I'm just sorry that the city made this move to implement a rail system right before the bubble burst on the economy.  I don't see expansion happening anytime soon, what with the muni-bond market looking like it does.  And that's really the only way to fund any type of real expansion to the north and the east.  I forsee this being a problem with the Lightrail's current expansion plans. 

Trains are always clean and secure...CATS has contracted with Allied Barton Security to staff the light rail at all times with armed security...not that the CLT is a dangerous place, but its a nice security blanket to have, especially when riding late night.  You may even get lucky and have one of the funny train operators in the morning and evening work commutes.  You can tell some of these guys really love their jobs!

If I'm on more of a set work schedule (which isn't often), the express routes to/from south charlotte are great!  82x is a great service for south charlotte, and beyond (they go all the way to Rock Hill)!  Word of advice; the tickets/passes for the express routes are an extra charge.  Don't try to get on the bus with a normal monthly Blue Line/ Local pass, or you may find yourself walking!",5
Public Services & Government,"I like the Charlotte light rail system, even though so far only one straight line has been built.  There are some flaws with it though.  It should run past 485 to close to Carolina Place Mall.  There also should be at least one ""east/west"" line somewhere, like right down the middle of the medians of WT Harris Blvd.  Regardless, I moved out of Charlotte to Fort Mill four months before the light rail began, but I still take advantage of it.  It's not advantageous for getting to work from my house, but it is great to get from my house to uptown.  I also work close to the Woodlawn Station, so the light rail is usually a no-brainer when heading uptown, especially when gas is over $3 per gallon.

I haven't been on a CATS bus and I've lived in metro Charlotte for over 10 years.  That's not to say I have a thing against buses; I took one to college almost every day in WNY.  The problem here is that there are only express buses that run to SC, despite the name CHARLOTTE AREA Transit System.  Also, it can take forever to get somewhere on a CATS bus after reviewing their schedules.  If they added more routes to SC and ran the routes in the city often, they would get 5 stars.  I'm looking forward to the next light rail line to UNCC hopefully opening in the next few years.  It takes quite a bit of time and gas for me to get to UNCC area, but the light rail would make it super easy.",3
Public Services & Government,"The LYNX is so awesome.  Parked (free!) at Scaleybark, rode into Uptown for a crowded day at Taste of Charlotte that I probably never would have gone to otherwise.  We need the Blue Line up to UNC Charlotte and the trolley out to the east, and I'll never drive my car again!",4
Public Services & Government,"Ok, I have lived in the area for over 10 years and never took a CATS bus until Saturday.  I took a Buffalo Metro bus almost every day to college (although it was often an express bus) so I am not adverse to buses.  My little community college was very close to the downtown transit center there, and the transit center in uptown Charlotte reminded me a lot of it.  The reason I took a Charlotte bus is because I wanted to go to Noda Brewing's grand opening but not worry about my car.  I took the light rail into uptown, and then took the 23 bus (easy to remember because it was MJ's number) along North Davidson.  My wife picked me up from the brewery and we went and had dinner, so it worked out nice.

Here are the good things:  Right underneath the CTC/Arena light rail station are somewhat clean public restrooms which can be hard to find uptown.  Transferring from the light rail to bus is free so that was really cool.  It was only a mile or two to 26th and NoDa.

Here are the bad things:  Buses stop a lot, sometimes for seemingly no reason.  It stopped at the bus depot just outside of uptown and waited for like 5 minutes to see if anyone needed to get on from a connecting bus (no one did).  Public transit was a lot nicer before everyone had portable phones.  I used to be able to sleep or do homework on a bus.  There is no way I could do that now.  The buses in Charlotte (or at least this one) seemed kind of small.

Despite the negatives, for $1.75, I was able to go 12-13 miles in about 45 minutes and drink without worrying about my car.  I am glad I gave the bus experience a try and will do it again, but I can also see why trains appeal to more people (faster, less stops, and they don't get stuck in traffic).",4
Public Services & Government,"I'm really impressed by the Charlotte transportation system.  Since I've moved uptown, I've used it on many occasions from the light rail, to the good old regular bus and the Sprinter line to the airport.  Since I'm not used to taking public transportation, I was a bit nervous about catching the correct bus.  I decided to call CATS and they were *extremely* helpful.  I basically said, ""I see a bus stop outside my window, and I have no idea what it's called or where it goes.""  The representative figured out which one it was and told me where I could go from there!  I've taken it to the University area which was a bit cramped on the way back during rush hour, and there were a few ""interesting"" passengers.  Nevertheless, it got the job done.  

The light rail is fabulous; however, as Nicole W., mentioned, I wish it had more stops and ran at more times.  It doesn't make sense to me that it stops running at 1 AM when the bars close at 2 AM.  

My absolute new fav though is the Sprinter.  It is freaking awesome!  The last time I didn't have a ride to the airport, I paid a $25 flat fee cab ride from uptown and of course left an additional tip.  The Sprinter bus is $1.75 and only .85 cents if you have a student ID!  It runs every 20/30 minutes depending on the time and day so I think it's pretty convenient.  Bonus for me - it stops right outside my apartment complex!",4
Public Services & Government,"I went to UNCC and lived in the area years later.  Never once took a bus anywhere.  20+ yrs later I came down for a Panthers game.  Parked at Tyvola (FOR FREE).  rode the light rail to uptown.  No waiting for an extra train,  no drunks or homeless camping out in the cars.  No bangers or dealers in the parking lots.  TAKE THAT BART.  Great job Charlotte.",5
Public Services & Government,"Living in Atlanta and working in Charlotte I like to use public transportation often ( outrageous gas prices don't hurt either) and I think Charlotte's bus system is miles ahead of Atlanta, the only problem I have is the groups of kids hanging around twice I've been here and seen massive group fights. I know its a transportation center but they should have a time limit on amount of hang around time. Other than that this is one of the best bus systems I've been on",4
Public Services & Government,"I don't like that they recently raised the prices, but overall, CATS is a decent transit system. You got to have alot of patience riding the buses, especially if you depend on them all the time (like I do). The LYNX is also great, but a light rail from the University area first would've been better. Traffic can get insane in that part.",4
Public Services & Government,"Once again, CATS increased its fares.  What started out as a $3 roundtrip light rail ticket is now $4.40.  This would not be so bad except that the fare is exactly the same regardless if you are going one station up or the entire length of the line. When you get a few people together, driving is actually more economical and easier.  Also, with the increased fares, you would think that everything would be operational.  On July 4th, a train that we were on broke down.  I was going to take the rail to the soccer game yesterday but half of the ticket machines were broke so there were lines at the ones that did.  One of the working ones was also selling only one way tickets.  I tried going to a different station and only one of the two machines was working there.  I drove uptown, parked for free, and it was much more comfortable and easier than being squished like sardines in a train car.  I won't say that I'll never ride the rail again, but the consumer value for me is not worth it anymore.",2
Public Services & Government,"Can be improved, but that can be said with anything. The only reason this doesn't have a 5 star review is because sometimes the staff can be rude, and the rules about cell phone use and eating are not always properly enforced. Other than that, 99% of the time the buses and light rail are running within scheduled time. And when there's an issue, CATS does work hard to find a solution ASAP. The system is expanding past just buses and a single light rail line, which as a Urban Planning major is hugely appealing. One note, the system is cash only unless you buy a pass at the CTC or one of their retail partners (Harris Teeter, Walmart, etc.) or at the light rail stations. I hope they install card readers on the buses soon, but I can understand the costs and things that would prevent that from happening. The prices have gone up over the years, but if you want to use CATS for your commute, it's still a far better deal that paying to park Uptown, which at a minimum is at least 100 bucks a month, mostly more. Plus you save gas and wear and tear on your car, and there's less stress from driving. Charlotte's express buses are my favorite. Unlike local routes, they stop at a handful of stops in their pickup suburb and then a few stops uptown at some of the busier office towers. They have more room and more comfortable seats as well as luggage racks. Overall, not the BEST transit system in the US, but sure isn't the worst and they are taking the initiative to improve.",4
Public Services & Government,"The public transportation here helped me out alot.
It was my first time ever being in the south but it was soo easy to travel here.
The drivers helped me out quite a bit and they were the nicest ever.
I got to know the whole city in a day because of the great transportation system out here.

The sprinter was my favorite but I believe I tried them all.",5
Public Services & Government,"One can't expect much from public transit in a city this size, I suppose. That said, some comments, from a business traveler:

The airport is not served by the new light rail. One has to take a bus, either to the city or to a light rail stop, which of course is an express bus with an elevated fare. You could buy a day pass for the entire transit system at a decent rate, but you can't buy it at the airport. So out of towners like me are not well served.

The express busses from the airport are at least reasonably fast and direct, but I had a torrid time with a couple of other busses I tried, one of which was almost a half an hour late (but the one before it was not late, or I would have caught it), and another of which had a route that was different from the posted map and didn't bother to let anyone know about it.

The Lynx, their light rail, is new and cool-looking but not free of drawbacks. For one thing, it doesn't really go to many useful places. The only extant route runs from the center of town through some anonymous suburban park and rides with not much going on around them. It does not go to the airport or the university. Probably okay for car-based commuters that live here, but not that useful to me. At the end of the line, they were clearly continuing to build, so perhaps the system will grow into something.

For another, the suburban stations are quite high off the ground, and with no escalators, you're either walking up quite a few stairs or waiting on the one elevator. At least the elevators worked. The trains themselves are quite nice, very quiet (I missed one because I was on those long stairs and didn't hear it coming), and run with appreciable frequency. The stations are very modern, and voice notifications abound. They run off an odd honor system policy; you buy a ticket and no one really checks. In theory you'd get a citation if you failed to pay. Why fare gates weren't an option I don't know.

All told, you might look at CAT and think it's cost efficient, but travelers might be better served by other modes of transportation until Charlotte builds more rail.",2
Public Services & Government,Sprinter bus is by far the cheapest way to get to the airport - only $2.25 I think vs. around $11 for an Uber and $25 for a taxi. I took it two or three times and it was always on time.,5
Public Services & Government,"What annoys me is when I buy a ticket and then no one checks for tickets, and I know good and well there be people on the train who ridin it fo free. In NYC they always check. This is a smaller city. There should be more consistency.

The bus depot is ghetto at times.

Pros: clean trains, free parking! Safe!",3
Local Flavor,"The Yiasou Greek Festival occurs annually around Labor Day.  It's held Thursday - Sunday.  Admission is only a couple of dollars and it's fun for the whole family or couples or groups of friends.  

Once you're in there, you can eat, drink, and be merry!  There are many options for dining (fast food or sitdown), desserts, shopping, rides for kids, entertainment, music, etc.  

We go every year because I crave the gyros and baklava.  I've tried both at different restaurants and festivals and nobody makes them better than the Yiasou Greek Festival in Charlotte.  That's not all they serve...but I'm always immediately drawn toward those two items.  There are many greek dishes available, though, and oh-so-many tasty pastries!  

After you've stuffed your face, you can wander through the shopping areas to purchase Greek foods to take home, jewelry, crafts, art, etc.  Then grab a Greek beer and watch the entertainment.  After this time has passed, your stomach should have settled some and you can go eat some more!  :-)

If you can't stand crowds (and it IS crowded every day of the festival) or can't find a place to park on the street, you can swing by their drive-thru, order your food, and bring it home to have your own Greek Fest...er, Feast!",5
Local Flavor,"OPA!!!!!!!!!!
Ha, man I had a great time at this festival in 08'.
It was so darn hot outside, but we still found a way to have a blast!
They drinks to serve and great food!
The people were extremely friendly; its small but very good.
Parking may be a bit difficult, but you just have to be patient.
Go to the 09' Fest; I'll be there~",4
Local Flavor,"I was definitely impressed with the Yiasou Greek Festival 2009! They organized this event very well and had a variety of things to do and eat for everyone. The festival was held from Thursday to Sunday and it seemed like they brought the entire city together.

Parking is difficult, but they did a good job incorporating police officers directing traffic. It was really busy when I was there on Friday night, but I heard that it was not as congested during the afternoon. If you are not a fan of large crowds, but still want to go, pick an earlier time. 

I was impressed with how many stages they had to show a variety of dances. There was one on the front lawn, back lawn, and one in a building. Like I mentioned, they planned and organized very well. In addition to spreading out the entertainment, they also put the food, shops, and rides in different areas as well (this way it helps to make every inch of their property filled with people). They had raffles, lectures, and educational rooms.

They only take cash, but they had 2 ATMS on their property to help you out. It's easy on the wallet and brings everyone together! If you missed it this year, plan to go next year.",5
Local Flavor,"I used to live close enough to be able to walk over but I'll still try to make it in 2010.  The food is awesome, well worth the wait in the long lines.  People are very friendly and this is a great event for kids since they  have all kinds of activities outside for them.  Great for couples too!  If you like gyros and a funky orb like version of funnel cake, you can't go wrong.",4
Local Flavor,"I am not a huge fan of the month of September and never have been. It's still hot out with a hint of cool in the air and not quite fall yet. However, one thing that makes me look forward to September is the Greek Festival. It's only $2 admission, they have great food with lines that move fast (they also have wine and beer-along with Greek beer and American), tours of the church, entertainment such as traditional Greek dancing along with little stands of jewelry, art and little trinkets. 

If you don't feel like going in, you can drive up and get a meat-o-licious gyro to go or other goodies such as baklava, spanokopita and more. This is easily accessible from the light rail but no parking so you either can light rail, walk or find off street parking in Dilworth. All in all, I wouldn't miss Greek Fest for the world. I may even go twice this yr!",5
Local Flavor,"I'm sure the shows, dancing, sales booths, etc. are great, but I'll be honest, I'm only here for the food. There are so many tasty options it's hard not to gorge yourself. I got a gyro, some of those little doughnuts, and a helping of baklava that's the size of a small pony.  All of the food is absolutely delicious and definitely worth fighting the traffic and crowds of people. You just might want to bring some mints with you to combat the killer breath after eating this food. I'll be sure to come back every year.",5
Local Flavor,"Advice...do not go on ""school field trip day""...ha! It gets a little crazy. First visit to the festival. Admission is only $2. All cash there, but the ATM's were everywhere if you need them. Great music playing in the tents and it seemed very well organized. Went for lunch to grab a gyro and boy was it good. Large enough to not need more than one, and the Greek fries on the side were seasoned very well. Made the ""gyro/fry"" order a success! Drank it all down with a big lemonade. Needed some treats after to hit up the baklava, which was sweeter than I remember, but very tasty in a limited portion. A great festival that I will continue to show up at every year going forward...just not when 10 school buses are lined up outside :)",4
Local Flavor,"Ya got your huge, eclectic crowds. Stage happenings audible throughout the block-wide party area. Random Made in China wares for sale at many-a-booth, some, smartly, with their tags cut out. Huge lines for food. Beer, albeit pricey. All the makings of a decent street fest.

What made Yiasou step over the line to Awesomefestville for moi: really, really good food, starting with the Baklava sundae and moving on down the line to Spanikopita better than any I've made (plus WOW those pastries held heat, 20 minutes after I buy the thing it's still trying to char my tongue). Slugging back multiple Mythos, a-leaning against a hallowed church stoop was hilarious and surprisingly comfy. Old school signage made me get out my camera early-on in the evening.

Parking can be rough. Totally worth the hassle. We'll be back!",4
Local Flavor,"I thought Thursday afternoon would be a convenient, less crazed time to hit up this fabulous festival...and it was...until the school field trip buses showed up.

Regardless of the copious amounts of baklava/sugar-ridden children running around their harried field trip leaders, this fest is a must in Charlotte. The food is outstanding...yes outstanding. I ADORE a fabulous gyro and Yaisou delivers. Quick tip - there is a car line to the west of the church (fest) for to-go orders. I stumbled on to this after we left the fest - this is so clutch for next year. Not that I don't enjoy walking around the fest, but when it's insanely hot and there are tons of sweaty people eating stacks of meat and sugary baklava sundaes, sometimes to-go might be a more delicious option.

$2 gets you in...and if you have a friend in the surrounding Dilworth neighborhoods (who are absolutely affected by and consequently and potentially irritated by the traffic surrounding their homes) they typically get a handful of ""I'm sorry"" tickets for free entry into the fest. Free admission for a fabulous meal, FTW!",4
Local Flavor,"I don't have a soft spot in my heart for festivals, but I'll make an exception for Yiasou Greek Festival.  For a mere $2 admission, you have access to several dances, lectures and  on Greek history, culture, and religion, and displays on all things Greek.  The food is quite amazing and the vendors stalls sell everything from Orthodox crosses to swords.

I tried the gyro and baklava sundae...SCORE!  The gyro was packed with meat and fresh, tangy tziki sauce.  The baklava sundae is three scoops (maybe more) of vanilla ice cream with baklava crumbled on top!  If you want  real Greek meal, they have serve a literal platter of food in the church's community center-lamb, chicken, Greek lasagna,and  salad.  There's also a tent behind the church that just sells Greek desserts,  whoa!  I had visions of sugar plums dancing in sync to Greek music that night. 

I'm amazed at the time spent organizing this festival.  There are numerous people staffing the information booths and explaining the displays on Greek history, like the Greek and Persian War. Don't worry, they play the movie ""300"" in the background and have little toy soldiers to re-enact the battles for you non-history buffs.  The church is an exotically beautiful Byzantine structure that makes the perfect setting for such a festival.  If you live in the Charlotte area, you must go at least once in your life. 

TIPS:  Bring cash (the ATM's charge a $3 surcharge) and ride with a group of people to conserve the limited parking.  Be prepared to walk a good distance to the entrance.",4
Local Flavor,"I have to say that it's been something like 10 years since I have actually been inside the gates of the Greek Festival.  Which is okay.  Even at the low, low bargain price of only $2, I don't feel like I'm missing much.

Sure, there is culture and there are rides (though I probably can't fit on any of them), but mostly there are lines.  Lines to get into one room and lines to get to the food and lines to get in in the first place.  But mostly there are lines just to get there because you have to park so far away.

So now I just use the drive-through.  Yes, you can get that lovely food to go by simply going through a drive-through, much like any other fast-food place (except the food is probably better).  You do have to deal with traffic, but take a right on Winthrop (I think it's Winthrop).  Give them your order, pay and you're done.

Even better is that they don't sell everything (such as the Greek donuts - or Loukoumades as Eric says), but they will actually let you park and run in the back entrance and pick them up and take them with you.  Simple awesomeness.",3
Local Flavor,"I go every year and am NEVER disappointed!!  This year I took the lightrail down and walked the few blocks to the festival - definitely easier than trying to park!  There is plenty to do for the kiddos - cute rides (yes they look safe and new!), bouncy houses, cotton candy and popcorn.  The dancing is non-stop and adorable as the Greek kids shuffle around.  I always for for the Mythos (beer) and a gyro and cookies.  This year we also got Greek pizza and plain pizza for the kiddo.  YUM!!!  Now I am getting this every year too.  The food lines get long so divide and conquer, one person grabs seats, another grabs beer (bring one ID up per beer you want!) and one person grabs the gyros.  Try to go at off times since it does get very packed.  Awesome way to spend an afternoon!!  Can't wait till next year!!  :-D",5
Local Flavor,"This was my first year visiting the Greek Festival after hearing about it for years I never had the oppurtunity to actually partake.  It was my 6 y/o and my girlfriend and I must say I enjoyed it immensly!  Plenty and I mean plenty of food choices, too many to even begin to try and remember but that combined with the entertainment in terms of dancing and the kids rides really creates a nice little outing.  I was very impressed with the events ability to cater to such a large crowd so quickly.  Yes, the lines get long for the food/drinks but they churn the people in and out pretty well in my opinion.  

One suggestion I would have is get there during the week or early in the day.  Avoid the crowds because it does get slammed.",4
Local Flavor,"First timer to the Greek Festival this year and I am so glad I went!  Be warned, this place is PACKED.  But it is so worth it.

The food is amazing, the atmosphere is lively, and there is plenty of people watching to do as you stuff your face with the most delicious gyro and Greek fries you've ever tasted.

Also, for those dessert lovers out there -- there is a desert BUFFET (to put it in over-sized American terms) where you can literally just walk down this beautiful line of Greek desserts and pick the ones you would like.  It's about $2 a dessert.  I split three with a friend and we barely made a dent.
And the best dessert of all?  My friend and I were walking through the festival having a nice conversation when she slaps my arm (hard) and says, ""Shut your pie-hole!  Does that say Baklava Sundae?!""  Needless to say, you should probably try one of those.

Another added bonus is the jewelry.  Beautiful gold, turquoise, silver and much much more.  I wish I would've came more prepared because I would've walked out of there with a new jewelry collection!  Lovely stuff.

Overall A+ here.  Don't miss it!",5
Local Flavor,"I have been in Charlotte for 20 years and have been coming here almost as long.  I love the frappe's, the wine tasting, the people watching, the gyros and the music.

You can't miss this festival, although I never win the Greek Trip drawing, bummer!",4
Local Flavor,"This is a great people-watching trip if nothing else. The selection of activities is not so fantastic, however. The festival is jam packed, tons of kids running by and into you, and not much to do but eat. So I wander, munch on some deserts, watch a bit of dancing, sit in the church and enjoy the stained glass murals, I bought a coin skirt once, and then I'm out. the most enjoyable part for me was being on the outside of the fence with a gyro from the drive-through stand. I did notice there are children's rides and face painting. I'm beginning to think this is a family-only festival as it's pretty mundane for the rest of us.",3
Local Flavor,"Every September the ambrosial aromas of roasted lamb, spanakopita, and baklava waft through Dilworth, drawing Greeks and barbarians alike to Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church like some irresistible siren song. So dig out those old Edith Hamilton books, pop in that Yanni ""Live at the Acropolis"" CD (don't act like you don't own it!) and get ready for the Hellenic awesomeness that is the Yiasou Greek Festival!

This festival may be more or less the same every year, but as the ancient Greeks used to say (in their equivalent to ""honey badger don't give a sh*t""), ""Hippocleides doesn't care"". It's always a great day out. And how can you really get bored with something that only comes around once a year anyway? The food is delicious and reasonably priced. They have live Greek music and dance going pretty much non-stop. There are rides for the kids and cultural exhibits and documentaries for adults. In recent years they've even had Classics professors from UNCC and Davidson College giving mini lectures on the Battles of Marathon, Thermopylae, Athenian democracy, Doric/Corinthian/Ionian architecture, etc. And if the heat gets to be too much you can find refuge from Helios' rage in the cool, dimly lit but beautiful cathedral.

I do have a couple pieces of advice though .

1. The festival is wildly popular. As such, parking is a nightmare. If at all possible, utilize public transportation. The rather indecisively named East/West Blvd Station on LYNX Blue line is only about half a mile (or 10 minutes walk) away with sidewalks the whole way.

2. You will likely hear loads of people raving about the baklava sundaes. In my opinion, the addition of ice cream to baklava serves only to diminish the pleasures of both. It's just too sweet. Instead, order the baklava plain and enjoy it with an iced frappé and stave off the beetus for another year.

Yiamas!",4
Local Flavor,"Having lived in Dilworth for over 10 years, I look forward to the annual Greek Festival.. Tonight I was able to make it to the drive through service, which allows you to get a taste of everything.  I ordered the Baked Chicken dinner & the Assorted Desserts.  The baked chicken entree comes with a variety of Greek treats, including a salad, pastitsio, grape leaves. The baked chicken is too die for, loved it.  The desserts were so good.  Something for everyone to try.",4
Local Flavor,"I don't know why but I just don't think the Greek fest is that awesome. I'm not that much of a fan of Greek food so maybe that's the case because after filling up and walking around for a lookeroo I'm kind of bored.

Yeah there's dancing and culture and all that, but anthropology never interested me that much anyways. I'd much rather have something fun to do or get involved in while almost everything at the festival involves waiting in line for food or looking at something.

At least I can usually get in for free. The food is nice and the people are friendly, which I think they'd have to be to be able to stand all that crowdedness in the area. Can you just do like a drive through window during the regular year and I can get some Greek food to go when I'm feeling lazy though? Cause it really sucks to brave the traffic/crowded train and pay admission to go buy some food.",3
Local Flavor,"Hooray!  Probably one of my Charlotte ""Top 10"" things to do in the city, the Yiasou Greek Festival always promises a good time of food, dance, music, merriment, and all things Greek.  I think it is so great the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral opens its doors to the public to share its tradition and culture.

I am mostly attracted to all the food and eating activities, but there are many other activities for the whole family to enjoy.  First off, the admission is only $3 and kids 12 and under are free!  There is plenty to do and see once you get in.  The Evzones re-enact the Changing of the Guards around 3 & 7pm every day of the festival.  I was lucky enough to catch it yesterday while I was there stuffing my face with pastries.  There is live music and dance with multiple stages where the youth from the church perform traditional village dances in traditional costumes.

Usually I kick myself because the last couple of years I have gone, it has been rather late, everything has been broken down for the day and feels like a tornado hit the church with all the debris and merriment that people before me got to enjoy.  This year I went on opening day and it was great!  No lines to wait in... they are super organized this year as far as lines and signage.  Before you just got in line and hoping it was the right one!

I enjoyed my chicken pita, Greek fries, and Mythos beer.  Ended my day (and probably shortened my life a little) with some baklava ice cream.  A huge serving of baklava (minus the pastry part) over 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream.  So delicious and sweet.  Then my friend had too many Loukoumades [they are very generous with the number you get], so I had one of those as well.

The new thing I got to see this year were the indoor exhibits and gift shops, very cool stuff available to shop and browse through:  jewelry, art, and lots of gift items.

The only tricky thing about this event is the parking.  I usually try to scope out some side street parking in the neighboring streets, but it looks like everyone does the same thing.  There is a lot to park in at the corner of East and Scott Ave (across from 131 Main) and there is a shuttle that will take you .75 miles to the festival as well.",5
Local Flavor,"OPA!! This was my first time attending the Yiasou Greek Festival and I was not disappointed. It was everything I expected from a great Greek fest - Authentic Greek cuisine, cultural exhibits, dancing, music, art, and shopping. KC & I went on Saturday around 7 and BOY was it packed!

The space was small and there were a lot of people and things packed in. It was difficult to navigate the tight pathways due to the crowds. Just be patient. Lots of people were loitering in the walkways making traffic move slowly.

The food was really the highlight for me. We got the baked chicken platter, which for $11, was a great deal. It came with a quarter chicken, triangle of spanikopita, greek salad, dolmade, pastisto, a piece of bread, and your choice of tea or coffee. I got white meat but they do not ask if you want dark or white meat. I bet you can request either if you have a preference. It was a TON of food. Everything was excellent. We also ordered a gyro. So good!

For dessert, we bought an assortment of pastries and a baklava sundae. The baklava sundae wss worth the price of admission alone. Enough to send you into diabetic coma. Three generous scoops of ice cream topped with a scoop of baklava bits. Amazing.

A few things I learned for next year...

Divide and conquer - There are a lot of different spots that serve food. There were different menus offered inside and outside. I wanted a platter and KC wanted a gyro so we got my platter and then found out we had to wait in a different line outside for the gyro. When you are outside, look for the signs on the tent that tell you what is served in that line. I also wanted a to try a feta pie but I found out that we would have to wait in a different line for that. You can't get anything else. The lines for food were really long but they moved quickly. Next year we will split up get our respective food choices and meet back up to enjoy them!

Cash is king - There were food lines that accepted credit/debit but they were not well labeled. Definitely bring cash. It would suck to wait in a long line and find out they don't take cash. There were a few ATMs around but I'm sure the fees were exorbitant.

Parking sucks - We found parking a few blocks over in the neighborhood. I would recommend taking the light rail or, at the very least, carpooling with friends. They offer a parking shuttle but you'll have to wait. Oh and avoid driving on East Blvd at all costs. The traffic is awful. 

Go early - The food was crave-worthy and I wanted to reprise the meal on Sunday after a long day of watching football. I decided to try out the drive-thru dining option that the festival offered. I patiently waited in a long line of cars to turn onto Worthington. When I did, I was disappointed to see that most of the food was crossed off the list. I was able to order a gyro and a piece of spanikopita but all the pastries were sold out. Until next year... 

Fun fact: yiasou is the Greek word for hello, goodbye, and cheers.",5
Local Flavor,"When an event is crowded I take it as a sign of success, but when it's *congested* like this one was I see it as a sign of negligent management -or worse greed. The solution is as simple as selling a limited number of tickets ahead of time, obviously the organizers are not interested in that, instead they boast of attendances of 40 and 50 thousands for the event. That's just crazy.  

Unfortunately Charlotteans must be really starved for street festivals since they oblige year in and year out. I don't know, I'd get if this was a free Rolling Stones concert or another once in a lifetime event ... but for Greek folk dancing, gyros and stuff? 

Since it's a community event rather than a purely commercial venture I gave it an extra star.",2
Local Flavor,"So this joint was a few weeks ago but I figure my review is still valid. 

Next year, if you're thinking about attending and you don't have any kids; here are a few reasons you may want to attend:

1. Cheap date.
2. Nothing else going on outside on a beautiful sunny day.
3. Feel like spending money on something other than an in-door activity. 

It was a gorgeous day but honestly after eating subpar Greek food and buying a recipe book (which was the highlight of my visit) my man and I mostly sat OUTSIDE the festival to watch the cars go by. 

I'm sorry but after eating Greek Fiesta (visit Raleigh/Durham area), it's not on the same level. 

Wasn't much for adults to do. Just a whole bunch of kids running around. The performances were aight and at times the service was ""Mer"" with a side of confusion. 

Perhaps by next years event, I'll have a kid to take with me. It'll make more sense.",3
Local Flavor,"This review will only touch on the drive-through food service, because that's all we made it to this year. They've really got this down to a science. We pulled in line behind a few cars and studied the menu (there were several large posterboard menus which had been attached to trees/poles down the street.) A volunteer came up to the car window and took our order, two gyros and a Greek salad. It was hard to wait until we got home (barely 5 minutes away) to unwrap the gyros, the aroma of meat, garlic and seasonings immediately filled the car. 

The gyros were fantastic, and the Greek salad was large and included generous amounts of pepperoncinis and huge chunks of feta cheese. We were full until well past our normal dinner time.

I was surprised to find that the prices were the same as inside the festival, even though we didn't have to pay the $3 admission fee.",5
Local Flavor,"They know how to put on a greekfest here!

The food is awesome, but so are the lines-be prepared to wait-but it is worth it.
More than just great food:
Greek dancing preformed
Church tour
Art booths
game booths
kids rides
lectures",5
Local Flavor,"The Greek Festival doesn't change much from year to year.  It's a well organized festival that includes Greek food served indoors in a large dining room or outside at booths behind one of the buildings (which is a little difficult to find).  There are a lot of desserts outside but they are not covered so you have to be careful with those.  We found the same desserts boxed up in a room inside next to the main dining hall so that was a little more convenient.  They have some vendors inside and outside.  Not all of the vendors are Greek-themed but that's okay.  The basement of one of the buildings had historical lectures about the Orthodox Church and Greek culture.  The church itself is beautiful and they have free lectures every hour.

This is a nice event but it is definitely the same thing every year.  I believe I first went to it 10 years ago and the festival is exactly the same.  The parking is tough especially during peak times.  If you just want food, they have a drive thru on Winthrop Ave but note that during lunch time there were at least 15cars in line for it.  If you haven't been to the Greek Festival, I'd say go.  If you have been to it, it is the same festival, so I would not make it a necessity to return.",3
Local Flavor,"Very disappointed this year (2014). Both fish dinners had strong fish. Unlike in the past cheap salad dressing used (Ken's). Another major disappointment was that the pistachio Greek casserole was NOT included in the meals this year. All this with an increased admission price to $3 per person. My family won't be back next year!

Karl M.",1
Local Flavor,"Plenty of things to do for the kids, however, adults beware. If the reason you are attending the festival is to enjoy Authentic Greek food, you are much better off at the local greek restaurant. This is festival ""Bizarre"" food at best.
Take the kids, enjoy the festivities and have a good time.",1
Local Flavor,As usual it's that time of year for the Greek festival. I only did drive they this time because it was pouring rain. Food heat as usual. Look forward to the festival every year.,5
Local Flavor,"First year we have been .. Really enjoyed it ...
Was super busy the food lines were long but fast and not over priced at all.. Could have had a better flow of traffic for people once inside as people were kind of all over the place.  But over all a nice fun day !",4
Local Flavor,"Yeah I'm a fan.  Been too long since I have gone to the Greek Festival in Dilworth but that is my loss.

Was originally going to go on Thursday night but we had torrential downpours in the area.  Went this afternoon (Sunday) and the weather could not have been nicer.  Clear skies, light breeze and temperatures in the 70's.

It was crowded as ususal so we ended up parking four blocks away and walking.  It was a pleasant walk and gave us a chance to see they old houses of Dilworth that were being renovated.

The festival was fantastic.  Several stages with dance exhibitions, great Greek Food and you could eat in or they had outside tables where you could also eat.

One high point was the fact that the priests gave lectures on the Cathedral, it's art and the significance of that art and differences between Eastern Orthodox vs Western or Roman Catholic practices.

The Cathedral is one of the most beautiful houses of worship in the Charlotte area and well worth taking the weekly tour at 3 pm on Saturday the rest of the year.

As I said, been a number of years since I have been but will be back next year.",4
Local Flavor,"The event was okay. I can't say I'm dying to go again, nor would I say it was horrible.
I love that Charlotte is big and cohesive enough to even have these cultural events. I know that they'll just get better and better every year. While it's a lot smaller than I'm used to and the food left a lot to be desired, I'm grateful that it's here at all. It's a good and inexpensive event to go to if you're looking for something new to do. 

Cons: 
-Small space, a little too crowded on weekends.
-Line for the church was so much that we ended up just leaving.
-Lines for food were kind of absurd. Go line up before you're hungry; by the time you get to the front, it'll be just right. I started out hungry, ended up famished and devoured my subpar gyro in under 3 minutes.
-Subpar food. Gyro was meh. I was so looking forward to one of my favorite desserts: the galactoburek, but it was subpar. All of the desserts were insanely sweet. I've never had such diabetes-inducing baklava.
-Agora had items that were either extremely overpriced or really tourist-chintzy.

Pros:
-There's interesting stuff inside the building. You really can learn a good deal about Greek history. For this alone, I'd not only go again, but I'd recommend it to friends.
-Atmosphere was great. People clearly take a lot of pride in this event. The music and dancing in traditional garb was actually really fun and livened everything up.
-People-watching, of course. 
-Wine-tasting booth. I can't say the wine was to my taste, but now I can say I've tried Greek wine!",3
Local Flavor,"What happens when a big, fat Greek festival hits the Queen city? lots of vehicular and foot traffic bringing Southerners in to get a taste of of gyros and baklava! OPA!

My friend and I decided to go on Sunday, the last day of the festival, thanks in part to the insanely gorgeous weather. Since my friend parked at the south blvd station and took the shuttle to the festival, they gave her free tickets! I made the mistake of driving (during peak times, don't even bother trying to find a lot closer unless you know someone who knows someone) and had to park my car in the south end, right on camden road and walk (which I didn't mind thanks to the weather). 

Once we arrived, we browsed the vendor booths which had an array of jewelry, scarves, clothing, and various Greek trinkets. We then hightailed it to the gyros booth because we were both starving. Thankfully, the lines were short. I got the chicken gyro and greek fries ($6 and $4, respectively) and we both grabbed bottles of greek beer ($5/pop). Honestly, the greek beer didn't have a distinctly different taste, rather it didn't have much of a taste.

Unfortunately, by the time we browsed the booths and ate, the baklava booth had sold out. major sads. Reason enough to come back next year!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I was pretty bored on this, and it's definitely over-priced. You can get a discount at the tourist centre by Waverley station (off Princes Street) but it's still pretty pricey.


 It has the most useless water ""ride"" in existence which transports guests about 15 feet forwards and then back to the original place of embarkation...


 Actors are quite funny and when I went there was a bit of banter between actors and one particular guest who appeared to be rather drunk...",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I am well hard but Edinburgh Dungeon is genuinely terrifying!  The actors are fantastic and the sets and props as gory as you can stomach! What is most disturbing though is that all the different attractions are based on real events that took place in and around Edinburgh. 

The Anatomy Theatre tells the story of medical autopsies in Edinburgh in the 1820s and how a shortage of bodies led to a couple of unsavory characters doing despicable things to up the death rate! 

The Extremis Drop Ride is based on the hangings which used to take place at Grassmarket and was a bit too much for my delicate nature but if you like scary rides which make you want to be sick then you'll love it! 

Mary Kings Close is where hundreds of plague victims were left to rot in Edinburgh in the 1640s. Mary King apparently haunts the close seeking revenge and the Edinburgh Dungeon team has got this section disturbingly accurate, right down to the smell of rotting flesh, yuck. 

There is a boat ride called the Cave of Sawney Bean. Sawney Bean was a mass murdering cannibal who killed travelers in order to feed his family of 46, the family being so large due to numerous incestuous relationships, lovely. Eventually the family was caught after they had killed over 1000 people. The men of the family had their limbs hacked off and were left to bleed to death where as the women and children were burned alive, double lovely!
 
There is also a William Wallace section where you hear his infamous story told by one of his followers. I'm sure you all know the story but it is great to see it brought to life in all the gory detail, freeeeeedooooom!!

All in all the Edinburgh Dungeon is a great day out if you like being scared shitless.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"My first experience with the ""Dungeon"" chain was when I was 7 and my parents took me to the London Dungeons. My distinct memory of this trip was when we went to have our photo taken like these tourists attractions do. So my dad is put in the stock (is that the right word? The thing you put your head and arms in) and gave me an axe to hold over his head. Now being 7 years old I thought the axe was real and it weighed a tonne making me panic that I was going to chop my dad's head off. So we have this lovely family photo with every one smiling except me, who looks completley terrified. It was only recently I came to terms with the fact that a. it wasn't a real axe, and b. I wasn't actually going to chop my dad's head off. It was traumatic though.

So my granny took me here recently. Seriously, my Granny is a social fiend and should have her own Yelp account because most of my reviews stem from places she has taken me. Anyway. Edinburgh has a fantastic history so it is perfect for the Dungeons. They cover everything from Burke and Hare to William Wallace, and they do it in a frickin scary way. The actors are brilliant and quite frightening, everything from the hair and make up to their persona's is so well thought out. There is this boat ride that still haunts me to this day. I was seated in the back corner and upon realizing that I was in the pitch black I decided someone was going to jump up behind me, so I promptly screamed. For no reason. This quickly triggered every other female and child to scream, while everyone else looked around clueless.

I am a massive wimp so everything scared the wits out of me here. It is quite a fun day out, but not cheap if you are taking the whole family. I'm not sure how scared younger kids would be by this, if your kid is a big hard man then probably not too scary, but if your kid is scared of the dark not the best attraction I think. And don't let them give your child an axe because it is mentally scarring!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Edinburgh is quite a spooky city. It has a history, lots of horror stories such as Burke and Hare, and so the Edinburgh Dungeon is one of the scariest! 

The lay-out is typical of most dungeons, blood seeping through the walls, creepy music and ominous dark curtains everywhere. The staff are brilliant, they really get into it and include people in the show. I prefer it when people are included, it gives you a sense of being part of it, rather than just watching a show. There is a really cool (but really scary) boat-ride as part of the trip, I am one of those people who jumps at anything, including sneezes, ringing phones and creaks. And I jumped at all 3 in the Edinburgh dungeon.

At times I felt it was a bit over-rehearsed and a bit boring, but overall it was a great experience and I would thoroughly recommend it.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I came here on my first visit to Edinburgh 3 years ago, and have deterred any of my visiting friends to do so since. It's a gory tour of Edinburgh's gory past, with a lot of dressed up people waiting around the corner to go boo. It definitely worked for the younger members of our tour group but it was very tackily done and the decorations and layouts of the places were not even convincing. And this is all for an expensive entry as well! My advice to those visiting Edinburgh is that you are in a very historic City with plenty of open air tours offered to real (quite scary) locations so why pay to see a replica of something you can walk to and see down the street ? (unless fake blood is your thing). I suppose it keeps the kids entertained?",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I love the 'Dungeons' - all that I have been to have managed to be pant-wettingly scary and funny cum educational all at the same time. No easy task I tell you.

Edinburgh's Dungeon has a bit of a helping hand on its side before you even walk into the building near Waverly Station which houses the horror - Edinburgh's history is genuinly frightening anyway, so all of the frights in the Dungeon are real events, from right here in the city - to me, this makes them that little bit more menacing and scary.

Anyway, the Dungeons take you through this history of Edinburgh and its dark side, with trips into time with Mary Kings Close and Burke and Hare. There is a lot of audience participation, as well as lots of frights as actors jump out at you. The Dungeon also has a dark sense of humour, with some of the areas being intentionally funny, but in a frightening way. 

The Edinburgh Dungeons  rank pretty high in my liust of frightening things to do in the Capital.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"The last time I went to the Edinburgh dungeons was a great experience and well worth the student ticket price of £10 or so. I remember waiting in the waiting room for the tour to start and an oddball in period costume stood behind my friend, grabbed his bum and made a disturbing groaning noise - I sincerely hope he was part of the performance as we didn't see him again after that. 

In fact all the staff seemed to take quite a liking to my friend and he was the object of ridicule in pretty much every scenario throughout the dungeon. First of all he was accused of being a cross dresser in the initial court section where he was referred to as Margaret even though he couldn't look less like a Margaret if he tried.

Next up he was told to bend over (don't worry, it's a family day out) in the torture chamber where he nearly came a cropper with some sinister looking objects of medieval torture. It was hilarious for me to watch him looking so embarressed but he took it all in good humour which is what the Edinburgh Dungeons is all about - it's just a laugh after all!

After 20/30 minutes of laughing at my friend it was my turn to be ridiculed and I was called up to help an oddball ""dissect"" a dummy where I recall having to pull out some sausage and a sandwich from the lifeless plastic dummy a rather bizarre experience but funny nonetheless.

Overall, I can't say that I found any part of the dungeons remotely scary but it's an absolutely hilarious afternoon out and I can highly recommend it! The actors are all fantastic and I learnt quite a bit about Edinburgh history and various different methods of medieval torture.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Yes, so it's full of tourists. And the staff assume that you're a tourist too when you're there. But it's still one of those things that you have to tick off your to-do list when you're in Edinburgh.

There's always some kind of simulator ride which comes at the end of the tour, and it's always changing. The one they have at the moment is called 'the last drop', and you all get ""hanged"" for your part in the Burke & Hare bodysnatching scandal. 

Cheesy, but good fun and it will make you jump in places. And even if they don't the stuff they tell you is really interesting and you'll find out loads of random things about Edinburgh that you never knew before!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"You've got to appreciate the cheese factor of this classic Edinburgh attraction, that has actually been around since the dawn of time. It's gimmicky, and pretty tourist orientated, but it is also education...sort of... made fun, and it's good banter for a random visit.

So many parties and birthdays when I was at school included a visit to the dungeon, so I think I had my fill of it when I was younger, and it was on the old site on Shandwick Place. Now that I'm older, and people are doing mature things for their birthday, I no longer get the regular opportunity to prowl around the dungeon, however, I am keen for a visit now and again when friends are visiting from other places.

Guides in costumes, a guillotine, stories and legends about gruesome events in Scotland's past, the black death, Burke and Hare and various other dark and spooky features designed to terrify you, make up the tour of the dungeon. Worth a visit for the craic.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I should give myself the official title of Elite Yelp Bargain hunter. 
The Dungeon has a very dear entry ticket price of 16.50 pounds per person. And if you are a student 16 pounds... woohoo 50 pence off. Well, that isn't good enough for me. Luckily the High Street Hostel provided us with a free map of Edinburgh that included coupons and one was 2 for 1 entry to The Dungeon! So we showed our student IDs and paid a fair price of 8 pounds each! 

Lisa G. gives a great review of what The Edinburgh Dungeon contains. The actors were quite good and I will admit that there were moments when I wouldn't let go of my boyfriends hand!

The Dungeon shoppe at the end it quite cheesy, and for those who are familiar with the chain Hot Topic or and Halloween store, that's all they have to offer.  But good rides and a scare none-the-less!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"If you want to do something fun, different and learn some Scottish history at the same time then there can only be one option - The Edinburgh Dungeon.  Folk who are not local to Bonnie Scotland may find the accents quite difficult to follow however they will still find the experience enjoyable particularly the hanging simulation at the end.  

But be warned - take a spare pair of pants with you as it is quite spooky!!!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Got free tickets, otherwise wouldn't have gone.

Cheesy and amateur.  Turn off lights and have someone randomly scream at you: same experience you'll have here.

Learning is fine but not what I would choose to hear about Scotland if I could do it again.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Absolutely brilliant fun, very immersive, and a great way to learn some of Edinburgh's less savoury history! The staff/actors are fantastic, be prepared for a scare!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Absolutely awesome! From start to finish I was a wonderful combination of terrified and well informed of Scotlands horrible history! From burke and hare to the hills have eyes-esqu sawney bean! The actors were fantasticly amusing, informative and creepy! The boat and hanging ride had me screaming like a banshee and almost sitting on a strangers lap! I would highly recommend a visit here! Also, the gift shop is ace! #bigkid",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Fantastic. There is a lot of audience participation and the actors are great at creating a scary atmosphere. If you don't like confined spaces, being touched, or talked to by strangers, or made to react in anyway, you may not want to do this. 

The employees are really good at what they do. One actually had me trying to climb behind people to get away from him. Even while I felt silly, he scared the hell outta me!  I happen to be scared of the dark, jumpy and a screamer -  I had no idea it would be so dark in there.. They caught on right away, so left and right I had the actors ""attacking"" me. It was scarier than I expected, but I was there to be scared so I have no complaints. I loved it (or maybe I loved surviving it - I am not sure).

The only disappointment is the water ride, which really shouldn't be called a ""ride."" The term ""ride"" was misleading.. But it is creepy still, so it isn't that big of a deal. Everything else more than makes up for it.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"This is an entertainment experience, not a historical tour of the dungeons of Edinburgh.  It was reasonable entertaining, but we thought we paid for something more educational in nature.  I would spend my entertainment dollars elsewhere.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Had a great time here. It is very fun and scary the actors do a brilliant job at both educating and entertaining everyone. The hangmans drop was the best part in my opinion, but the lady in green was also very well done. 
The only let down was that I was in such a small group (only 5 people. 2 couples and me) I would have preferred to wait a while longer to get a larger tour as I believe it would have been a better experience. 
Overall I highly recommended going to the dungeons... If you dare.",4
Arts & Entertainment,I had such an amazing time at the Edinburgh's dungeon. The actors were great. I was in a small group and kept getting pick on for participation. It was quiet fun. I loved the free fall haha .,4
Arts & Entertainment,"I had an absoloute blast here.  Got the tickets at a very reasonable price through our work adn went with the work crew to enjoy the horrors and hilarity within.  You walk in and descend the stairs to get admission and onto the dungeon proper.  I wont spoil the suprises and such but i will say that the actors make this, they are pretty convincing for the most part and you learn a little history along the way.  You go through various themes and famous stories from the past with set pieces abound and a good variety of actors and scares. You get to a drop ride at the end as well which is a little bit of fun and fright if your up for it.

Cant really say much about this without spoiling the surprises except i loved it and would happily go back here anytime!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Not as scarey as I hoped. Mostly adults in our group -  group of 15-20!  Good fun but disappointingly not scarey at all!  One 4 year old started crying when a corpse fell out during the Sawnry Bean enactment (the most grotesque part I'd say relating to cannibalism) and there where parts where they startled members of the crowd. My highlights were the room with the ghost haunting of the woman killed by her husband and The Drop Dead ride. There were some technical issues and only half the group could go on at one time, so I crossed my fingers nothing would go wrong!  The boat ride was anticlimatic as it hardly moved.  The maze was confusing as there was no way out until later revealed. 

A highly entertaining activity especially for children but don't think it was worth paying full price (£16.75). Look for 2 for 1 deals or book online (£11.25) but you have to choose a time.  We brought a voucher from an Edinburgh map which turned out to be expired but they gave us the same deal (£6 off full price ticket).  Children under 5 are free which is a bonus (but have to be 1,5m to go on the drop ride).  Be sure to make your entry photos good as you get a chance to see /buy them at the end (quite pricey -  we spent £25 for 4 photos,  one in a glass frame). The best was the look of fear on our faces as we were 'hanged'!",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Surely the greatest geographical mis-step on The Royal Mile, The Loch Ness Discovery Centre is a good 200 miles off course. It's quite shameless in a way, as it piggybacks on the relentless desire for Scottishness on this street to the extent of exploiting a tourist curio that has nothing whatsoever to do with the city.

At £5.95, you're probably cheaper actually getting a bus to Loch Ness to have a look for the old girl herself. They justify the price by pointing out that they put a lot of money into ""scientific"" research to find the monster.

Aye right.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"This is clearly for visitors of the City who don't have time or cannot be bothered to head to Loch Ness itself. Add some 3D and some fairytales (or scientific evidence- whatever way you want to look at it) you get to see hand on evidence around the myths surrounding this loch. Most of the evidence comes from the (slightly derranged) individuals who spent a lot of time looking at the lake. Or devising machines to proove their point. You can proove anything with facts these days. And photos.

After your Loch Ness Discovery troop over to the Loch itself if you have time. You are going to spend the first 5-15 minutes starring at it as well, convinced that  that movement in the distance is Nessie herself. That's ok we have all done that- half-jocking or so we pretend to.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I can describe this place in one word.

SHAMELESS.

Tourists, who come to Edinburgh to see all things Scottish must lap this shit up - we are 200 miles from Loch Ness here, but whoever thought of this place just decided that they could abuse tourists wallets by making them think they can experience something that is just as Scottish as haggis, without ever leaving the city.

If you do decide to pay the £6, dont be dissapointed at what you get - a weak 3D video looking at some 'evidence' from 'experts'. Cough.

It really is shameless, a blatent scam on tourists - and frankly it gets me a bit worked up.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Like the other reviewers, I can't help but think that the Loch Ness Discovery is a little bit of a con and a rather cheeky way to make a quick buck from unsuspecting tourists. The Royal Mile is full of tourist traps but this really takes the biscuit.

Open 7 days a week the Loch Ness Discovery tells you all about Scotland's greatest mystery, in 3D form no less. You'll be told about the hoaxes, witnesses and photos of Nessie and I guess in the end you can make up your own mind about this place.

I'd rather keep the £5.95 thanks very much.",2
Restaurants,"this place looks long past its glory days. most of the reviews on their walls were from the mid-late 90's. why was my aberdeen prime rib so tough? sigh. it's a cute place, but not worth the visit if you've only got a few days in town. somewhat overpriced.",2
Restaurants,"Having an American friend over to visit, I had to introduce him to the highlights and the lowlights of Scottish fare - deep fried pizza (http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/rainbow-restaurant-musselburgh); delicious ice cream (http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/s-luca-musselburgh); tablet, broon sauce, pies and the such like, I felt it was required to show him a little more of the high life that us Scots enjoy. He wanted to try haggis before he departed our shores, so we took him to Stac Polly to see what they would come up with. 

Stac Polly definitely has highs and lows:

Lows:
* sample menu online is the same as they used on the day we visited - less sample, more stock - bit disappointing as it gave the impression that there was a rotational menu, perhaps on local availability, but it wasn't the case
* no vegetarian main course. That's just poor show, chaps
* Cranachan dessert. Given that Stac Polly was the place that introduced me to this fantastic dessert, it was extremely disappointing. Oatmeal that was left far too long in cream and whisky, turning what should be light, into a cream/oatmeal cake. The raspberries in sauce felt like they came from a tin and far too sweet - gave the heavy cream little if no contrast and became an overwhelmingly rich and unpleasant dessert. Came out far too quickly and clearly sitting in a fridge for longer than necessary. Less haste, more pleasure!
* As the place was heaving, service was a little harried, but the waitress herself was perfectly pleasant. 
* No steak knives for the steak, which was a little on the tough side

Highs
* Accomodated my request to remove meat from one of the fish dishes so I could eat it but found random broccoli in the risotto - I have a food intolerance to the stuff, so rather bemused to find it on my plate. along with some buried beans - suspect there was a plating malfunction!
* Lamb was apparently perfectly cooked and cut beautifully

Overall, I am less impressed with Stac Polly than I used to be - I didn't feel the quality of the food was as good as I remember when this place was a regular haunt for myself and my family - it's good, but it's just not that good that I would necessarily pick this as a place to take guests again.",3
Restaurants,"Game in rich sauce, seafood, little cubes of tablet with your coffee - Stac Polly does good Scottish/ French-style food. It's a pleasant venue*, staff are friendly ... so it's hard to put my finger on why it's just not that exciting. 

First, I have to say that everything I ate was delicious - scallops in their shell, pheasant with chestnut puree, a nice bottle of red and then coffee. J's partridge was tasty but a bit tough, but the venison was amazing. 

Like Catriona, I find the fact the menu doesn't change a bit disconcerting - they must get bored with doing the same stuff, surely? Shouldn't it depend what's good on the day/ week? But .. they do it well, plenty of practice, I suppose! 

I would go back if I had visitors to Edinburgh who would appreciate good Scottish ingredients - you can get haggis in a fairly safe and non-scary little filo parcel, for example! But not if anyone in the group was vegetarian, as there's nothing at all listed for them to eat. And if it's just the two of us - probably not. There's too many other places in Edinburgh to try. 

*I won't blame them for the lack of phone coverage/ wifi, but it was frustrating for a geek like me. And it's odd that everything's downstairs, leaving an empty waiting-room area on street level. Going up there to go to the loo was vaguely alarming - who knew who had walked in off the street and was hanging about in this empty area?

(Oh, and it bugs me when restaurants add a service charge. Feels sneaky, and like they think you don't know to tip, We tip! But if you put a  service charge on then you're not getting a penny more than that.)",3
Restaurants,"Traditional Scottish restaurant that does what it says on the tin. Old school dishes (game, beef, salmon) served in a traditional environment in the New Town. It ticks the box nicely if that's what you're after but hard to think of a reason to go more than once in a blue moon because it's exactly the same all the time.

I had partridge for my starter which was mixed. The breast and the cabbage and bacon accompaniment were excellent, but the wee leg was charred beyond recognition. I couldn't get into it with cutlery and was forced to pick it up and take a bite . . . but I couldn't. Absolutely rock hard. Really didn't match with the quality of the rest of the dish and the quality of everything else we ate. Maybe it was just one of those things. The venison main was excellent though. The staff were nice, the place is very nicely turned out, if not quite as warm as it could be, so it's a good place that I would consider taking someone who wanted olde worlde charm, but there wasn't really anything to drag me back.

And while having the restaurant downstairs is nice enough (although it blocks your phone reception...!), the empty upstairs bit that's open to the street is bizarre. A few tables and chairs with no apparent purpose, and you need to go up there to reach the toilet. Weird.

So I'm a bit torn on how many stars to give. Other than my cremated partridge leg, the food was very good, and it's a nice place, but somewhat meh at the same time.",3
Restaurants,"Armed with a voucher for a meal out at Stac Polly, we arrived at a very stylish place. 
The surroundings reminded me of the inside of an Tudor Barn home stead, they even had the alcove open hearth.  We were greeting with great enthusiasm. 

I am firstly impressed with the fact that we were able to use their normal menu, unlike other restaurants that present special voucher menus. The only extra was a supplement on the steak and drinks. So if you are picking up a voucher for this place, you get a real deal! 

Second I need to mention the service; pleasant, friendly and efficient. No faults or mishaps detected throughout our visit. 

And lastly I commend them for the chef's skill. Our Ham Hock Terrine and homemade pickle was delicious. The Rabbit was brilliantly paired with the black pudding. My Aberdeen Angus Fillet steak was cooked to perfection and the whole peppercorn sauce was rich and full of flavour. We finished with a rich Chocolate Cheesecake - this proved to be indeed very dense and rich. (Mostly finished off by Anita A.) 
- Portion sizes of all meals were spot on. 
The normal prices are £22 for the Rabbit and £27 for the Steak. For the quality and skill I would be prepared to pay that. 

Also wine by the glass is in relation to the bottle price. Nice. 

The coffee came with a fudge (hey, it is a Scottish Fare restaurant after all) which was buttery and sweet. 

All in all it was over and beyond my personal expectations. This place has the service, the chefs and the ambience deserving of a 5 star review. 
We will definitely go back here this year without the aid of a voucher",5
Restaurants,"I had a very enjoyable meal here, and on a Groupon deal too so that's definitely a bonus. I find online deal meals can be very hit and miss, but in this case I would come back to Stac Polly for sure. 

I went to the restaurant on Dublin Street, which is down in the bowels of a building. So it's not got anything in the way of natural light and it feels a bit catacomb-like, but for romantic atmosphere that's probably a definite bonus. 

The service was speedy and polite. Waiters and waitresses kept us well-watered and fed and were very pleasant to chat to. 

The food itself was lovely. I ordered a game terrine with piccalilli to start and it was delicious. My main course was lamb with lentils and various other veggies and it was the best piece of lamb I have eaten in a very long time. Yum!

The only thing I would say about this place is that it's pricey. It's over £20 for a main course so you had better be expecting some very nice food indeed for that price. But for the quality of food and atmosphere, I'd say it's definitely worth it for a birthday meal or special night out.",4
Restaurants,"My husband and I hosted a large dinner for family and friends (about 40 people) at Stac Polly on Dublin Street on a Friday night with a set menu from their Autumn 2014 selections. The food was stunning, as always, and at a very reasonable price. The starter of Baked filo pastry parcels of finest haggis, sweet plum and red wine sauce was a real crowd-pleaser (every plate was perfect) and eloquently introduced the Roasted rump of Borders lamb with mustard and herb crust, aubergine and red onion tart tatin, star anise carrots, fine beans and game jus. Everyone who ordered the Vanilla pod crème brûlée underlain by summer fruit compote all agreed they could have eaten a gallon on it!

I cannot emphasis strongly enough the quality of food and cooking at Stac Polly. I have enjoyed Scottish fine dining in a number of highly acclaimed restaurants in Edinburgh but not one outstrips a meal at Stac Polly. The attentive and relaxed service in a warm and understated atmosphere results in an experience reminiscent of a good meal and excellent company in the home of close friends with the benefit of someone else clearing the table :) I can't wait to go back!",5
Restaurants,"Loved this place. Might have had something to do with the excellent gin cocktails (raspberry Guilin fizz & Valencia orange) that were flowing but it's not the only reason. 
We sat in the wee room to the left of the bar. It was quiet and L & I were the only diners in that space. There were another couple in the more traditional space further round. 
We shared the goats cheese served on a bed of rocket, tomatoes & chickpeas for starter. There was also a basket of fresh brown baguette which was very moreish. It set us up nicely for our mains - monkfish & salmon skewers with a courgette rosti & some salad. The fish was perfectly cooked although I thought the rosti was a bit bland. 
I had the drambuie panna cotta for dessert. It was a huge portion & despite my best efforts & some assistance from L, I couldn't finish it. 
The service was excellent & the lady who served us was engaging & chatty without being intrusive. I'd definitely return to this branch & I'd like to try St Mary's Street because that is within stumbling distance of home.",5
Restaurants,"Though Coming here for the Fringe Festival and the great (yes, great, dining) I have been avoiding Stac Polly for about 10 years because of it's rep as the place for the Scottish Experience. How stupid of me. This is a exceptional dining that I would be happy  to see in any great culinary Capitol in 
the world. 
The food was superb, and we have eaten in most of the top restaurants in Edinburgh over the years, the service  professional, and the ambience perfect, in a tucked away corner under the street, very cosy and warm. 
Don't neglect the warm onion tart starter. It far exceeds it's description. And my friend who is a fan of haggis was thrilled with her wee pouches in a spicy plum sauce. 
From there to salmon and lovely lamb rump. Both wonderful. 
This was a meal to come back for year after year.",4
Restaurants,"The OH wanted to try this place after I raved about my lunch here. It's taken us a while to make it here but we finally went for dinner on date night. 
The food was excellent but we felt that the service let down the whole experience.
We had to repeatedly ask for drinks and at the end of the night the staff seemed to be more Interested in chatting amongst themselves than giving us the bill. We waited 20 mins & then had to go & ask for it. 
Very disappointing.",4
Restaurants,"Had dinner here at the suggestion of our concierge at The Scotsman. 

We were not disappointed. Lovely, intimate setting in a wine cellar. Food and service were impeccable. 

Lovely experience overall.",5
Local Flavor,"Nelson's Monument, located on the top of Carlton Hill, is in honour of (you guessed it) Admiral Nelson, hence its quite clever design as an upside-down telescope. 

 It was built in the early 1800 at a time of new prosperity for Edinburgh. On top of the monument is a time ball which is lowered and raised and acts as a time signal initially for the ships in Leith and in the Forth. Nowadays it is linked time wise to the One O'Clock Gun at Edinburgh castle.

  I actually went to the top on a doors-open day one year and was blown away of the 360 degree view of the City and port of Leith- definitely worth it as you can see for miles! However, even if you don't flog all the way to the top, it's well worth heading up Carlton Hill to see it (and it's neighbouring monuments) and admire Edinburgh below!",5
Local Flavor,"Nelsons Monument rises out of Calton Hill like something out of the deep - so its safe to assume Lord Nelson would have m ost probably liked this monument himself.

The monument is spectacular - the coloumn itself is a upside down telescope (very neat!) and on top of the plinth stands Nelson himself - its more than impressive. Get right up close to it and it will take your breath away.

The views from the top must be spectacular, but as you can get up there you'll have to make do with the views down at the bottom - but saying as you are on Calton Hill, they are still special.

Worth a visit - even if it is only just so you can say you have been there.",5
Local Flavor,"I'm going to keep this simple - if you're in Edinburgh and done all the touristy stuff and looking for that 'oh wow'....the x factor.....that something special, then make your way to Calton Hill and get involved in the Nelson Monument. I can't really say much more as it's all been said before me...but wow. just wow.",5
Local Flavor,"Honouring Nelson...
Looming over the city...
A great view at dusk!",4
Local Flavor,"Yes! Go here!!! Free to enter Calton hill but to climb the monument you will have to drop £4. You get a certificate stating you climbed all of the stairs and such. 
It provides an awesome view of edi. 
I enjoyed this one as much as I enjoyed Scott's Monument. 
Very friendly woman at desk and the little museum at the bottom was pretty interesting giving the history of Nelsons monument. . 
Go to Calton hill or watch from princes street. At 12.50-12.55p the ball raises to the top and drops at 1p. It was designed for the men on the ships to see time since it traveled faster than the speed of sound (the castle canon). 
Very interesting and worth it!
Bring camera and walking shoes.",5
Local Flavor,"Great value at 4 to get to the top of this - 143 steps gives you the best views all around Edinburgh. Good views all round - Arthurs Seat, Holyrood, The Castle, Forth Bridges, Leith and Fife and Bass Rock. Pick a clear day and you wont be disappointed. Superb - and probably better for views than Scott Monument",5
Local Flavor,"A must see! Calton Hill is an awesome destination for tourists and residents of Edinburgh alike. 

On a sunny day, the views are immaculate and the a Nelson's monument is the icing on the cake that allows you to go even higher for for more breathtaking views of the city. 

Whilst Carlton Hill is free, entrance to the monument is £4. I don't think they're handing out certificates for climbing the monument anymore, or at least I didn't get one. 

The climb is short but steep, and I enjoyed the little words of encouragement along the stairs which are also an indicator of how far you have left to climb. 

Once at the top, you can move around to see different views, there are also little info boards which tell you what you're looking at. 

Cannot reccomend this enough, a new favorite place for me!",5
Local Flavor,"The Phoenix 20/30 guys really know how to throw a party!  This year was the 25th year for this event, and I believe they had record attendance and money raised for it as well.  I was impressed with how well organized the event was from start to finish.  The moment you valet your car in the parking lot, there is a trolley waiting to take you up to the Wrigley Mansion for the event.  (Well, this is ideally how it goes but we did have to wait a good 10 minutes for our trolley).  

I was lucky enough to attend a special VIP dinner reception before the general admission began, and it was fantastic.  The VIP dinner was outside on the north side of the Wrigley Mansion with incredible views, service, whiskey tasting, and more... Once inside when the general event started at 7pm, I was blown away by the fact that they had an open bar, live entertainment, and all kinds of food to sample... all from high end restaurants too!  The mansion was open for guests to explore and in all of the rooms were different restaurants offering tastes to the guests.

I didn't get to stay so late since I had the triathlon the next morning, but if not for that, I am sure I would've stayed until the very end!  The crowd was diverse, friendly and fun.  The silent auction was one of the biggest I've seen.  The Phoenix 20/30 guys were all running around making sure the attendees were having fun.  Special thanks to BK, Marcus, Will, Kyle, and Nick for looking out for me and for giving Yelp a presence at the event as well.

I took the trolley back down to my car around 9:30 and the guests were still pouring in.  This may have been my first Noche de Gourmet event, but it will not be my last!",5
Local Flavor,"This year - 2012 - was my first Noche de Gourmet event! The 29th Annual Event. This year it was, once again (according to Gabi's 2008 review) extremely well organized and this year, once again, held at the Wrigley Mansion. 

I once heard that guys in their 20s & 30s were still trying to find themselves . . . don't believe it if the Phoenix 20/30 Club membership is any indication. These guys were absolutely on task, prepared and super organized. I've attended a lot of large events and they usually all have a few snafus that should not have happened. The only snafu all evening was that it rained for 5 minutes. And I don't think the 20/30 Club could have predicted or controlled the small change in the weather. Besides it cooled everything off nicely (maybe it was planned too?) and cleared the night sky. The night view from the Wrigley Mansion was a sea of twinkling city lights.

Food was fantastic, drinks were wonderful, and the music made you want to take your shoes off and dance. 

What a great fundraising event for the Children in Need Foundation - (www.cinfaz.org) Trivia: Did you know the 20/30 Club was founded by Barry Goldwater?

If you get an opportunity to attend the 30th Noche de Gourmet in 2013, don't pass it up! It will be an evening of fond memories!",5
Local Flavor,"I struggle to write a classy review for Noche de Gourmet 2012. Not because the event itself wasn't classy- trust me. Everyone there was decked out in their tightest cocktail dress, swankiest shoes and more 'bling' than a rap music video. The Wrigley mansion itself is meticulously perfected to prevent any girl with giant heels to walk correctly anywhere thus increasing the appearance of being extremely alcohol-induced. 

No, i'm not making fun of the people at Noche de Gourmet. This is a personal report.

Noche de Gourmet was so loaded up with unlimited booze that it went from a fancy cocktail hour to a really f-ed up Prom... and I mean that it the nicest way possible. At every corner there was either a beer/wine stand, a full bar, a Macallan Whiskey tasting, a Cruz tequila table or some server handing out bubbly. Strangely enough, only people with the VIP ($250/ticket) could order liquor at the bar instead of beer/wine, but that instruction didn't seem to transcend very far with the bartenders and servers- and for that, I am thankful.

Food wise, it was the epitome of indulgent. Although there were many many amazing restaurants, a whole week after the event I can only remember the top of the night: miniature cupcakes, boeuf bourguignon and mashed potatoes and the 4325 grape leaves (and baklava) I ate at Pita Jungle. Dear Pita Jungle, I ate your entire booth. I'm sorry. I regret nothing. 

And then there was the dancing. Oh boy. I think this is what I call the ""downturn"" of the evening. See, after eating a months' worth of food and enough booze to tranquilize a horse, there is nothing left to do but to dance (and possibly look like an idiot while doing it). The band was very classy and adult-like when the event started, but as they got closer and closer to end time they started busting all their best songs, with the occasional DJ break. If you haven't seen a girl in giant heels bust out the horse-riding dance to Gangnam Style, then you clearly have not met me.

So why is writing a classy review to Noche de Gourmet so difficult? Because when you are attending a $150/person all-you-can-eat-and-DRINK event, there is no way in hell the night is going to end classy. But as long as its tasty, fun and with good company, who gives a rats ass about classy anyway?",5
Restaurants,"This is a great concept, and other restaurants should take notes too! Reds is the most family friendly restaurant that I have ever encountered, they have a buggy parking facility, a nappy changing room, a huge array of high chairs and best of all a great children's play area. 
How many times have you been to a restaurant and you hear children whining and moaning, and its not their fault, they want to explore their environment, and that's natural, Reds has cottoned on to this idea and it seems to be going down a treat, every time I go past Mum's and Dad's pack out the place. Although every table in the restaurant has a view of the play area,  Reds also has a CCTV system that allows their children to be monitored even closer to ensure their well-being.
Looking at the menu, it does seem to be a tad on the expensive side, but it does have a good varied menu for children with lots of healthy options and a good variety for adults too.",5
Restaurants,"great place, friendly and relaxed.  Built around the idea of a genuine family restaurant with a small (big for the space) soft play in the back room.  You could go without kids, sitting in the front, but it's sells itself and really caters for families.  Excellent general facilities in terms of baby changing, space for buggies.  I like the food - not excellent but good quality and quantity.  Usually always a smile from the staff who seem to have the patience of saints given I have been in when it's like a chimps tea party.  I would love to see more genuine family spaces like this in Edinburgh.",4
Restaurants,After a disastrous day looking for somewhere to go to let my niece burn off some energy Reds was my saving grace!  It's only small but it does the job and there is always other children there for your kids to play with so you can sit back with a nice cup of tea and take a breather! Thank you Reds- you saved my bacon! xxx,5
Restaurants,"Got kids? Great place. 
Space 4*
Kids area 4*
Food 4*
Menu options for the kids 5* 
Service 5* no complaints 
It's always hard to find somewhere as parents of two young children to eat somewhere you don't feel self conscious in when the inevitable meltdowns begin but here you have it.
Reds is a little inconspicuous and you would easily have driven past it without noticing! It was a Sunday we were here and it was surprisingly quiet but in we went. They have cctv here which is a real comfort especially if you're sat in the front section as you can see what's happening in the soft play bit. The menu is extensive, ESPECIALLY the kids menu which is a real draw. As every parent knows sometimes you want to pick something other than nuggets or spag Bol for your wee ones. The adult menu is equally as extensive. 
If you have children younger than two bring your own toys as there are none which baffled me as it sells itself on a family cafe and the small addition of toys would go a long way! Hence the reason why I have 4 instead of 5*!!
The coffee is good and the smoothies are freshly made. The kids loved the smoothies. As for the food I couldn't complain. We ordered a full reds breakfast which just looked like it was made from quality ingredients and the taste matched that. We also had French toast with maple, smoked salmon starter and garlic bread with cheese. All were excellent quality and we will definitely be back. The service was excellent too considering it looked like the one waitress.",4

Axis of Awesome totally rocked the Gilded Balloon, with songs of modern living and social commentary; songs about KFC and teenage drinking, Harry Potter and writing floppy guys off as a tax deductable item.

Reviewing an Axis of Awesome concert has an element of ""situational humour"" (you had to be there), and the musical stylings go beyond the obvious comparisons of Flight of the Conchords or Tim Minchin - each are doing their own individual homage to musical parody with totally different styles.

But the sheer....intelligent idiocy? of Axis of Awesome achieves some real belly laughs, sprinkled with a little well-timed cringing.

It's hard to pick favourites but the KFC song, the pimped-out parody of ""Can you hear the $%^&* music comin outta my car"" and the medley of the four-chord song had me in stitches.

Well worth the ticket price while Axis of Awesome are at the Gilded Balloon, or finding out if they're coming to a theatre near you..!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"First of all, excellent name. Not a clue where it comes from, but it is wonderful.

This is a solid place to see a show. I was here for the Fringe and saw a few things throughout the weekend here. All of them comfortable, great sound, lots of fun. The only issue it really has against it is it's a maze. Trying to get anywhere in here is a journey. They do their best at labelling and putting up signs, but I think I still had to ask someone each time I wanted to get anywhere.

But it's a slight price to say for an excellent show venue. Got a chance to see something here? See it.",4

I took some time out to meet the Melbourne, Australian trio, Aunty Donna to find out what they had in store for this years debut at Edinburgh Fringe Festival. These friendly 'awesome' guys met three years ago while at Acting School and soon came to realise they were actually quite funny!  The curiously named 'Aunty Donna' was coined after they found out they all had an aunty named Donna. Fresh from San Francisco 'Sketch Fest', they now embark to conquer the Fringe. 
When asked to describe their show in three words they claimed it is 'Fast Paced Mayhem'. 

In their opening sketch Broden Kelly, Zachary Ruane and Mark Samual Bonanno take to the stage, landing us in a hipster coffee bar, their witty scrutiny is taken to ludicrous limits as they act out the scene in outrageous physical comedy.  Oozing with energy, the fast paced trio speed us through original, slightly surreal, big and brash comedy all executed in suit and tie.  Each working in balance with one another: complimenting their different strengths.  We are taken on a singing and dancing journey of men who flight like kangaroos, a widowed husband who deals with grief through puns, loose rope walking, beat drops at a funeral and fatherly love that goes all wrong.  Of course a comic show visiting Edinburgh would not be the same without the obligatory Scottish accent gag. 

It's noisy, it's daft, it's filthy, but in all the right places. Just beware of the great audience interaction. I do hope you like popcorn. Their show goes a bit off kilter at the end when they perform a parody of a TV show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, which isn't actually aired in the UK, which seems a bit irrelevant but you still get the joke. 

Four stars.",4
Restaurants,"I stopped for a breakfast due to my flight being delayed.

The cappuccino was acceptable, as was the table service.

I ordered the breakfast burger, made with Scottish beef, bacon (English style), and a ""fried"" egg. The egg was microwaved and the yolk was not left runny as I asked. The burger was also cooked extremely well done to the point where the inside resembled the outside.

Despite the poor cooking methods/technique, the burger was flavorful. The chips were also good and had an appropriate amount of seasoning.",2
Restaurants,"We went here to grab a quick bite before catching a flight.  The menu is ok, nothing to rave about.  Nothing really shouted ""EAT ME"".  I choose the spicy tomato pasta.  It was a decent portion but it just didd't have the depth of a good sauce, not like a proper homemade itaian sauce.  I could go saying mamma mia.  The wine I choose was an african one and was really nice.  Service was ok although we did have to ask another table if we could use there salt and pepper as there were none on our table.  the OH had chowder - which again was the run of the mill. `Alright for a quick bite to eat but don't expect any wows.",3
Restaurants,The service was so slllllllowwwwww.  The food was decent though.,1
Restaurants,"Every time I go travel I always try to eat before I arrive at the airport because I always get so disappointed about the food in the airports (and the price) but unfortunately this time I didn't have time. 

On our way back home from Edinburgh we stopped by the restaurant to have a meal before boarding our flight, and I'm so sad this was the last taste of Scottish food we had because to be honest, it was so bad! 
We both ordered a burger and the meat was cooked way to much and almost impossible to chew and I think the meat had been frozen and just heated. The rest of the burger did not have any taste at all and I used almost all the ketchup at the table in order to get the burger to have a little taste ( and I normally don't use ketchup) 

The fries was actually not so bad, but I can only give one star to the restaurant because not even the service was good. There was almost no one at the restaurant but a lot of waitresses on work, but still we could only order from the one who was serving our side of the restaurant.",1
Restaurants,"Dette er en serviceoplysning til rejsende fra alle lande, der måtte bruge Yelp til at finde et sted at spise i Edinburgh Airport.

En gang i mellem betyder dét, at man ikke har fået noget at spise, før man tager i lufthavnen, at du bliver nødt til at spise noget i selve lufthavnen. Dette er ofte en dårlig oplevelse, da lufthavnsmad ikke ret tit er af god kvalitet. Denne leveregel bekræfter Gathering Bistro & Bar til fulde.

Udefra så spisestedet såmænd helt okay ud, men det viste sig desværre at være en hundelort forklædt som en brownie!

Vi bestilte en burger og pommes hos vores tjener, som udover at være sløv, selvom der var få kunder i restauranten, også snakkede med en enormt tyk skotsk accent, hvilket var enormt svært at forstå, når man nu ikke lige er lokal. Da vi lige havde været i Edinburgh, kunne vi jo godt forstå lidt af, hvad han sagde, men altså - du arbejder i en lufthavn. Snak tydeligt, så folk kan forstå, hvad du siger! :)

Vi fik vores mad efter lang ventetid. Det viste sig at være en overstegt burger med slatten salat, tomat og nogle pickles, der lugtede virkelig klamt. Dertil kom der en lille skål pommes frites, som var hverken salt eller smag.

Vi spiste vores mad hurtigt, for vi blev nødt til at se det som ren brændstof. Desværre kunne vi ikke komme til at betale og gå ret hurtigt, da vores tjener havde travlt med noget ude bag ved, og hans kolleger kunne ikke hjælpe os, da de betjente en anden zone... 

Der er virkelig ikke noget så latterligt som at betale en enorm sum penge for at tygge i en klam, overstegt burger uden smag, mens man samtidig får rigtigt dårlig service.

Dette måltid er uden sidestykke det værste måltid og den værste kundeservice, jeg nogensinde har fået i en lufthavn - og, som nævnt i starten af denne anmeldelse, så har det mad, man kan købe i lufthavnen, ikke ligefrem noget fantastisk ry i forvejen.",1
Local Flavor,"After living in Edinburgh for 8 years and hearing about this place I thought I would go down and have a look for myself and see what the fuss was about, so I arrived and found there is ample parking just out side the door. When you enter the warehouse as that's what you would call it you get a blast of Scottish heritage directly on the left hand side of the door which by no means is cheap but the prices are a lot better than the high street. As you carry on from the left side you enter the men's section and golf area which has loads of great deals at very good prices , their Resturant is no Michelin star quality place but it's run by very nice polite elderly people who make great soup , their steak pie is also really good both in taste and portion size. You carry on through from the Resturant in to the home area which do cheap linen, curtains and bedding . Through in to the next section and you have a great fish shop there are numerous tanks, plants and practically everything you need for both tropical and fresh water fish, it's defiantly worth a look their fish are really good too haven't seen so much variety in a long time and they are cheap. When you leave the fish shop you enter a curio type area which does Yankee candles beautiful jewellery and ornaments adjoining the shoe area which is much to be desired it's one of the only places in Edinburgh that you can get all types of shoes from sketchers to pavers at up to 70% off retail price. They have a great loyalty service and make sure you pick up one of their cards each £25 you spend you get a stamp and when the card is full you get £5 off , OHH and don't forget the loft area there is loads of last season product at even higher reduced prices you have to be willing to dig for the bargains , I hope this helps and inspires you to visit this gem of a place.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"The Underbelly is the umbrella term for the list of entertainment hosts during Edinburgh's Fringe festival. Every year, the venues come alive in August with live comedy acts, quirky theatre and, y'know, just about every show imaginable! 

I am running out of adjectives beofre I've even begun describing some of the shows here. There's some gritty new theatre, stage school showcases of the highest quality, audience participation events, relentlessly funny comedians, interpretive dance, book turned play adaptations, travelling shows - you name it, and it's on the bill. 

From my experiences at the Underbelly it is predominantly comedy on the menu but there can be some surprises! My favourite Underbelly show, witnessed at a venue of the same name, was a spoof murder mystery tour called 24 Ways To Die. It was an absolute riot and kudos to the actors, because at times I was scared witless! It was very interactive, which most Underbelly shows are.

Although there are now many branch offs of the Underbelly, this venue I am reviewing is the mothership, and with its back alley, underground feel and amateur acts, it feels like a secret treat to even have a drink under the starry canopy, and that's before getting to the comedy. It's utterly bouncing throughout the festival and a must see, even if you do only stay for a beer! But with shows all under £10 as a general rule, why don't you stay a while?",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Probably the best of all the venues in the Fringe, Underbelly is a mix of bars, music and a comedy venue. Found just off the Cowgate, near Grassmarket, sometimes you do have a lot of drunk lads outside which can be off putting. However don't let this sway you, once inside it's awesome. Over 2 floors, the interior is pretty grubby, but holds a certain skanky charm. It always has rock / indie music playing and the crowd are generally pretty cool. 

The bottom bar is always pretty rammed, especially just before a show, but the smaller one upstairs is a lot quieter. They stock all the normal drinks, and as with all the venues are pretty overpriced. The staff are all pretty friendly considering they are always busy and work until 5 in the morning.

Underbelly also doubles up as a comedy gig venue, hosting one of the late shows. With tickets costing about a tenner, you get a range of about 4 comics starting from 12 and going on for a few hours. Although the line-up changes every night, all the comics are pretty good and it's a great way to spend a late night",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I've no idea why this place isn't open all year. It's unbelievably cool. Every room feels like a damp air-raid shelter, with corrugated iron arched roofs and exposed brick walls and there are so many of them. There's bars, a café, loads of venues all in the same historic and extraordinary archways. It's grubby in a cool way. I'm such a scenester. 

Set in the arches under South Bridge, it's my favourite of all the festival venues. The variety on offer is great. I saw a brilliant, moving and electrifying play here yesterday called Blackout (go and see it, please), and the day before I watch the delightful Josie Long in another of the many theatres. 

Underbelly have to be applauded for creating such an exciting and vibrant venue. The range of shows is great but it's really all about the venue. I just wish it was open all the time.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I second Neal W - this place should be open all year round. It's just awesome, and brings a touch of laid back lantern-lit quirk to the rather...sticky* Cowgate area.

Literally (correct use of the word this time!) under the bridge, you go through this big archway and can immediately get lost. A café, an indoor bar, big sets of stairs, a small bar leading to an outdoor bar lit with beautiful lanterns and heaters, more winding stairs with an upstairs bar, venues for shows.

Each Fringe venue has its own personality, and Underbelly is the off-the-beaten-path, cool kid on the block. It has the feeling of a tucked away, hidden secret which is actually sprawling over three floors that you feel silly for not having noticed or explored it earlier. 

The outdoor bit doesn't feel like it's outdoors. It's in a wee courtyard with fake grass and benches and a bar and hotdog stand. The heaters are HOT, swear they were melting my face, so unless it rains it's this cool little indoor/outdoor space. The building is obviously just used once a year for the Fringe venue purpose and whilst they install bars and the like, they don't decorate so it's still all the old stone and old layout.

It's everything I love about Edinburgh. Steeped in history, not trying to build new on top of old, but work with the old and make it even more beautiful; a random, beautiful mix of folk; open laaatteeee but without getting rowdy. 

I think it's my new favourite Fringe venue.

*Can an outdoor area be 'sticky' in the same way a club floor at 2am can be? Well, you know that feeling when your shoes stick to the ground and if your scarf falls on the ground you'd rather burn it than wear it again. Yeah, that feeling. That's how Cowgate is, all the time.",5
Arts & Entertainment,The Underbelly has got to be my favourite fringe venue! Really stunning building. No theatre in the world is like it..i'm quite sure of it! Usually a high standard of show too! Can't recommend this place enough...,5
Arts & Entertainment,"It's unique, it's atmospheric, it's a myriad of different spaces and corridors and passages. But it's a little tired these days - time for a shake up perhaps?

The Underbelly is perhaps the very essence of an Edinburgh Fringe venue: unusual location, quirky spaces, an edgy feel that provides the perfect setting for some very interesting work. And yet as the years go by this edginess becomes the norm, quirky becomes a bit uncomfortable and unusual doesn't have quite the same appeal when other venues are out-weirding the place. Added to that a shift in Underbelly's attentions towards Bristo Square and the Udderbelly and you're left with a venue that could do with some additional spark.

Perhaps I'm being harsh (I've seen some great work in here during the festival) but you wonder if there's scope to do more with this labyrinth of ancient brick under the Central Library. As the year-round home of the Bongo Club perhaps there'll be more innovation in the months ahead, which could rub off on the festival venue. I shall continue to watch - and visit - this space.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I love the Underbelly in The Cowgate, it's one of my favourite places to catch a show during the Fringe. It's massive, it's like a labyrinth inside, there's tons of bars, even a beer garden, and loads of stages, performing areas, and nooks and crannies to get lost in.

Do not go in wearing a jacket, the downside of so many things squeezed into one space is that it's sauna-like in it's humidity. You will sweat, you will feel beyond roasting.

That may be part of the charm of the place though.

Do yourself a favour, when The Fringe is on, check the listings, and get along and check out something here. For my money, the best venue in Edinburgh when The Fringe is on.",4

Are you prepared to go Beyond, beyond the norms of the every day and reality, beyond into a mystical world of hallucinogenic stunts and dreamy far off places? Internationally commended performers Circa 'invite you to step Beyond, into a mysterious world where bestial comedy meets irreverent vaudeville.  Beyond crosses the line between human and animal, between madness and sanity, between logic and dream.'  Yaron Lifschitz, director of the Brisbane based Circa brings us a multi-talented troupe of dynamic breath-taking balances, super flexibility, who all appear to defy the laws of gravity. 

Two women wearing oversized white rabbit heads with floppy ears sit on chairs in the initial scenes, distorting the lines between human and animal. Sometimes appearing to be possessed by animalistic tendencies. One female member proves she is just as strong as any man, by holding the weight of three men while trying to solve a rubik's cube, as ever gender roles are under constant inspection by Circa.  The seven strong troupe display stunning sheer talent, making unnatural movements appear effortless, captivating the audience through a fast-paced network of outrageously skill feats and comedy.  Everything is a feast of the eyes, beautiful shadows play against the red velvet curtains as a woman cavorts from a belt strung from the ceiling, contorting her body then spins out of focus.  Circa demonstrates astounding strength with nimble grace, making their bodies appear weightless.  Dropping down Chinese poles leave the audience gasping for more. In a comic rendition they join together for a song, they may not have it when it comes to singing but they are proud in the fact that they 'did it my way'.  Five stars.",5

I have turned so many of my friends on to this pasta dish I should be getting royalties.  My twist is that I have it with linguine instead of rigatoni but hey, to each their own.  The place is a good size place with a nice view, prices are reasonable, and parking is easy.",4
Restaurants,"This place was amazing.  First of all, it's a wonderful location.  I arrived after most of my party, and they seated me immediately, and quickly offered a drink and a menu.  The staff smiled and was very attentive and friendly.  Despite ordering late, my food arrived just a minute or so after the rest of the party's food did, and it was wonderful.  I ordered a creamy shrimp and scallop dish that I do not recall the name of exactly, but I'd recommend it.  Ask for a little oregano and some olive oil on the side, and add it to your taste.  Amazing.  (I'm a little particular in the tastes I look for, obviously... )

Also, the location is great.  It's on a hill overlooking the Las Vegas area, and the windows were so wide as to make the best use of this view.  It was spectacular.  You could gaze into the clear skies for hours.  They also have a bar area and a gaming area with their own players club, but neither of those things interested me, so I don't have a review for those.  But the food and the service was very good.  The decor was nice, as well, with wooden tables and wine racks, and stone elsewhere, but I didn't notice it as much as the view..",5
Restaurants,it was pretty good last time we went - but they're now CLOSED....,3
Restaurants,RIP. This place is now closed down. It is turning into another Lindo Michoacan.,1
Local Flavor,"Right beside Easter Road stadium lies a hidden gem in Edinburgh. A beautiful little park with a big pond running parallel.

Lets start with the wonderful view. You can see for miles up into the hills and get a great view of Arthur's Seat (not that it's hard to miss).
It's smack bang in the middle between the cIty and the sea, so you get the fresh salty air but none of the seaguls shitting on you.

Some locals give it a very bad reputation due to some reccent stabbings, but lets be honest, what park doesn't frighten an OAP? The only time you have to avoid is it is when the football is on, unless conversation with winos is your thing. 

Go on a nice sunny day and enjoy one of the best alternative views of Edinburgh you'll ever see.",4
Local Flavor,"As a park this place is steeped in both potential and disappointment and it really should do much better than it does.  Its okay for a quick trip to the swings, but it should really be one of the best parks in Edinburgh.

Its setting cannot be faulted; it surrounds a lovely loch and is backed by Arthur's Seat so on paper it should be something quite stunning and a great place to sit and relax on a summer's day.

However, when you get here you will usually be a bit disappointed.  It's not full of litter, but there are occasional items of debris like a trolley in the loch that spoil it.  I can't help but feel that if it was treated better and maybe contained a few shrubs or flowers that it could be perfect - as it is it's just a big letdown.",3
Local Flavor,"Super park, secret gem, and recently upgraded!

Since previous reviews, this largish park with a country feel has been upgraded: it now has wooden decking out over the water, lots of foliage has been cleared to improve sight lines, and the locals have got together to litter-pick, put up bird boxes, and make sure the council look after it well. If you're community-minded, join the Friends of Lochend Park. They've recently bought the Police Box too!

The loch is the big draw, with swans to feed, and herons too..if you're very lucky, you can watch herons catching fish (never seen any carp here though!). There's a nice slope for sledging with kids. There are a couple of picnic tables, and plans for major cycle ways to come through the park in future.

Currently frequented by dog walkers, young couples (often teaching small kids to cycle) and everyone in between. Hidden secret.",5
Restaurants,"The service was not good and the menu is not impressive.  I did not like any of the pizza options (you can either get vegetarian or ""standard"" beef or pork toppings (no chicken or fish toppings like you can get at places like Wolfman or Anzi or Brixx).   I ordered the Salmon Artichoke Pasta and quite frankly, it tasted like a frozen entree that you would buy in the grocery store.  My partner ordered one of the meat pizzas and found it to be heavy and greasy.   We found no reason whatsovever to go back.",1
Restaurants,"It's a nice alternative to Brixx and the delivery chain pizza places, but not too much of a step up.  The pizza is coal fired, but I didn't notice that impacting the taste too much.  The coal firing gives it a subtle smoky taste, but that's about it.  I thought the sauce was overly sweet.  The toppings were good quality and generous.  The wings were actually pretty good, and the salad was acceptable.  

The space itself is nice with several big screen TV's, nice wooden tables and chairs and a full bar.  The service was very good- they even comped part of my meal after a small mix-up on the order. It's definitely kid-friendly and very accessible for wheelchairs.

Overall its worth a try, and a good place to go if you're tired of the other options and need a change of scenery.",3
Restaurants,"went with some freinds this weekend to visit cheese mo'z was very disappointed.  we ordered 2 different pizza's , both were just okay nothing to brag about.  the pizza with ham, pineapple an pepproni the edge was burned not just from the coal of which our waitress tried to tell us an a few pieces of the ham were burned.    however i will say the meat toppings they were generous with. i will say the cheesey bread was good :)   the service we received was very poor.  three of us had empty glasses we asked her for water an tea it took a while.  that happened at least 3 times this was during lunch on a saturday, they were not croweded at all.",1
Restaurants,"Our group was very dissappointed with the pizza.  The margarita pizza was loaded with garlic which was overpowering - ended up throwing out half of the pizza. However, The Trailblazer, sausage, roasted onions and peppers and portabella mushrooms was good.  The wine was not very good we actually sent it  back becuase it was old.  Best just to stick with the soda. 

When we went almost 1 year ago, it was very good.maybe it just was not a good night.

It was not crowded tonight, so that wasn't an issue.",2

Was about 9
Months since we were there and must say we will not be trying this again!

As for using a 800° coal fired oven, the pizza had little flavor at all. There is nothing supreme about this pizza. Trust the other reviews this was a place to drive right past! By the way they said they delived, but not for lunch! I tried them twice just to give them a fair shot and both visits were equally disappointing.

You have a mini carnival for the kids with rides and booths of funnel cakes and hot dogs. There is a whole lot of vendors peddling stuff. And there is food and live music. The reason why this place only gets 2 stars is that I wish everything would have been more St. Patrick-esque. I get that you have to have the carnival stuff for the kids. But, as an adult (or so I believe I am), when you go to a holiday festival like this one, I would like to see places selling celtic gear and corned beef and cabbage.

Fun for the children included the ferris wheel and carousel.  Since the Las Vegas Valley does not have a permanent ferris wheel and carousel to ride, we enjoyed taking a twirl on both.  Ferris wheel tickets were 4 tickets per person. Carousel tickets were 3 per person, but an adult is free if standing next to small children who are on the ride.  Each ticket = $1.25.

Local Flavor,"So after a nice day trip to Boyce Thompson Arboretum, I suggest my husband head north to Roosevelt Lake, and take a ""shortcut"" back to the Valley through Apache Junction via State Route 88.  Screw the GPS lady's instructions.  What does she know anyway?

Well apparently this computer bitch with an Australian accent knows my ""shortcut"" is only shorter in mileage, not in hours.  I soon learned State Route 88 is actually the Apache Trail, approximately 45 miles of the most beautiful scenery you will find in Arizona.

From Roosevelt, it includes about 20-25 miles of unpaved switch-backs that wind through the mountains with fantastic views of Apache Lake.  There are several one-lane bridges along the route.  Further on, you'll pass through Fish Creek Canyon (yeah, I had to look this up later).  The road hangs along the side of this high-walled canyon and can hardly be described-it is unbelievably awesome.  Other stops along the way if you choose include Tortilla Flat, Canyon Lake, and Goldfield Mining Town.  Lots of beautiful places to stop along the way (if you can find a place to pull over) to enjoy the wildflowers and many streams you may find.

Now, for the practical.  Don't drag your RV through the unpaved portion.  Don't drive like a lunatic when you can't see around the corner.  Remember, some of us are here to enjoy the drive.  If you're afraid of heights, probably not the route for you.  At minimum, take the drive starting in Apache Junction so you're hugging the canyon walls for the entire trip.  We took the drive in reverse and were cliff-side for the majority of the trip.  And speaking of cliff-side, have some courtesy for those drivers.  They can't pull over as far as the canyon-side drivers.  We spotted several areas on the cliff-side where the road has eroded somewhat.  Don't make this trip in a beater car in July or in heavy rains.  Some areas will most likely not be passable.

Have fun!",5
Local Flavor,"One of the most scenic drives in the US, this twisting 80-mile loop contains a good 22 miles of dirt roads, so make sure your vehicle can handle it.  We took our rental Suv crossover and had an absolute blast.  My husband loves driving scenic twisting roads and I gladly let him take the wheel.  
The drive twists through canyons, mining towns, the superstition mountains, and along several beautiful man-made lakes. After you return to pavement, make sure to visit the Sinagua Indian dwelling at Tonto National Monument - it closes at 4pm so get there early to walk through a magnificent ancient cliff dwelling. 
Be sure to stop for food before you get onto the trail, because this will be an hours-long journey with little chance for food or gas.",5
Local Flavor,"What a scenic drive, albeit anxiety invoking. We only drove from Apache Junction to Tortilla Flat but that was good enough for me. Between the one lane bridges and crazy mountainside curves lacking guardrails, it's enough to picture yourself driving right off a cliff. Definitely take your time and be careful. The views are worth it unless you're seriously scared of heights.

Visit Date: 11/20/09",4
Local Flavor,"What a twisty great scenic road, with one lane bridges, blind curves, steep drops into the canyon and no guardrails to mar the view. 

Just the kind of road I love to drive on, but this time I was a passenger. I would normally not even get in the car with someone else behind the wheel. K and I both went over a cliff together when we were teenagers and she has the same fear as I do and did not speed. 

This is a great drive and well worth the terror I felt. I would do it again",5
Local Flavor,"Whether you are a local or a tourist you have to drive the Apache Trail at least once! I think I've taken every friend or family member that ever came to visit me in Phoenix through it. It's a day drive you want to plan for, pack a picnic lunch to enjoy along the way as there are limit food service options. 

You can first pick up the trail (State Route #88) near Apache Junction heading straight for Goldfield Mining Camp. You drive pass the camp, headed toward Apache Lake, Saguaro Lake & Tortilla Flats. I recommend taking time to picnic near one of the lakes. There is a little diner near on Apache Lake, the food is decent and affordable but nothing to rave about. You also have an option to grab a burger at the Saloon in Tortilla Flats but the really enjoyable experience is to enjoy the fabulous view and being in the outdoors for a picnic! 
The entire drive is gorgeous!!! Yes, as previous yelpers have noted, the road is windy, it gets steep and several miles are unpaved. The key to this drive is to know this will be a day trip for you and just take your time and enjoy the desert landscape. If you are Phoenix based living in the cemented desert it's easy to forget how beautiful Arizona can be. The Apache Trail will remind you how gorgeous the desert can be. There are several options to get off the road and stop for pictures or just to enjoy the view. 

At the end of the route you get to stop at Tonto National Monument which features Indian Cliff Dwellings. Now there are lots of these across Arizona. However, very few of them are stable enough for you average person to be allow to climb up to them. It will take you roughly twenty minutes to climb up to the ruins. Bring water, the hike isn't that strenuous but it's gets hot up there and by the time you get there it will be afternoon. There is a nominal entrance fee, last time I went is was only $4 per person and there is a Park Ranger at the top to answer any questions. 

I do recommend driving back using the US-30 through Globe. No one should go back the way they came as it will be dark and scary on the way back. You can get back to downtown Phoenix in less than two hours via the freeway! 


In one day you get to rive through the Superstition Mountains, see Apache Lake, Roosevelt Lake, Roosevelt Dam, Tortilla Flats, Tonto National Forest & Indian Ruins. This is in my top five of things to do in AZ!",5
Local Flavor,"What an amazing drive this is!  I drive east from home on Main St to State Rte 88 and in about 30 minutes I'm away from the city and suburbs and into the most beautiful and amazing scenery around.  

The first part of the drive is fairly easy on paved roads - there are a couple stops for scenic views, the first to view Weaver's needle and the second a great view of Canyon Lake.  I do this part of the drive at least once a month, I have a great need to see ""big"" water.  Drive a little further and you end up at Tortilla Flat - there's a restaurant/bar, an ice cream store and a souvenir shop.  If you do this on the weekends in the winter expect major crowds here.  Past Tortilla Flat the road is still paved for a more miles and then it gets good.

The unpaved road is graded and can be an uncomfortable drive and I'm sure it's not good for my car, but I just can't resist.  Keep driving the curvy road and be careful, in many places it's just one lane and a lot of the other drivers seem to want to speed on by.  The scenery is magnificent though and worth every mile.  Soon you'll hit Apache Lake - and if you drive down to the marina? there is a building with a restaurant (looks kinda dumpy), a small store and they have boat rentals!  Something I will have to do one summer.

Keep driving and the water continues on your left until you hit Roosevelt Dam.  If you're not expecting it, it's a very large dam and just seems to pop out of nowhere.  But for me the best part is just 'round the bend when you see the suspension bridge and Roosevelt Lake, HUGE water!  I'm from Chicago and lived near Lake Michigan, and as much as I love the mountains, I really do miss seeing water.  It's almost breathtaking once you get this far.  

Once you've reached the end, for me the best way is to head toward Globe and get on 60W to head back to the Valley.  I've gone the other way through Payson and it's a much longer ride (or so it seems)

Be sure you have a full tank of gas before you start this trip, there are no gas stations and it's several miles past Roosevelt Lake before you see one.",5
Local Flavor,"Was in Phoenix on a short weekend trip and was worried that the trail on Highway 88 would take a long time, but was really surprised the time it took to get to Tortilla Flat from Apache Junction, right off the 202.

Even with the winding roads and 15-25 MPH speed, mutliple camera spots and breath-taking views, it made a great afternoon ride..

I didn't go past Tortilla Flat, but got some great camera shots!",4
Local Flavor,"Good day trip.  Canyon Lake for quick dip, then Tortilla Flat for lunch.",4
Local Flavor,"This is such a fun drive! But it's not for those who get car sick or dizzy on the teacup ride at Disneyland (yeah, I'm talking to you mom). 

Anyway, there are a lot of twists and turns along this drive if you start it out in AJ. You can take a paved road all the way to Tortilla Flat which is just past Canyon Lake. You can stop at Canyon and go fishing or enjoy other water activities or stop at Tortilla Flat and grab a bite to eat at the restaurant and ice cream next door at the parlor. You can drive a few miles past Tortilla Flat on a paved road, but then it's dirt to an overlook (beautiful by the way), which can be a bit rough on a small car. If you plan on taking the dirt road bring a truck or SUV. Wish we could have gone further. Oh, well. We'll have to save the rest of the trip all the way to Roosevelt Lake for another day. Depending on where you live in the valley this take take up a few hours or the whole day. 

Bring your patience, as you may get stuck behind someone towing a boat.",5
Local Flavor,"I took this route without really knowing what it was on my first self-supported bicycle tour in 1995.  My girlfriend and I decided that Arizona was the perfect place for a winter bike tour and, not being from the area, just plotted a circuitous route from Phoenix to Tucson on a highway map, and off we went.

What a surprise it was!  This is some of the most beautiful desert scenery I'd ever seen.  Canyon Lake, Tortilla Flat, Roosevelt Dam and Lake, the 22-miles of dirt road, the cliff dwellings - it was all spectacular.    

As others have said, be prepared for a slow drive over narrow winding roads.  Don't rush it.   And if you find it enjoyable, don't turn around at Tortilla Flat!  You'll miss the spectacular dirt section, which I think was prettier than the rest of it.  Don't pull your big 5th wheel, trailer, or drive your motor home over this section though, as many of the turns are tight.  I took my 2WD truck camper over it several years  ago and had no trouble, however.

Note for those of you who plan to bike this - be prepared for hills, many in the 10% category.",5
Local Flavor,"WOW!

We started in Apache Junction and made our way along this historic route. Having planned ahead I knew what to expect but at the same time it was surprising.

We stopped along the route at various places including an old gold mine, a lake, a dam and an old film set?

Back to the trail. It's pretty smooth sailing to Tortilla Flat, we went on a holiday weekend so that may make it busier but overall it wasn't busy traffic wise at all.
Tortilla Flat was the busiest part due to it being one street and parking being near impossible.

Carry on another few miles and wait....what the....where's the paved road gone?! I have no idea why this stretch towards the dam isn't paved but this dusty road was all there is to it.

It takes a little while to get accustomed to the bumping of the car along the road, almost like going over many potholes constantly but it's a rental so whatever right?!
The bumpiness seemed to go on forever coupled with crazy SUVs zooming past kicking up dust.

The road winds, heads up and drops down with some extremly scenic points on the way. I could not take it all in as I had to keep an eye on the road. Some bits were narrow, really narrow, but there are sufficient passing places to not be a concern.

It was a fun drive and it seemed almost odd to get back onto normal paved roads. The dam and suspension bridge were amazing sights, not something I'd expect to see here.

We carried on, taking a right onto Globe, passing the Tonto National Monument which was like a small version of Mesa Verde. Finally the trip back to Phoenix and it was all over.

Any car can make the journey but be prepared for a few parts that are extremely bumpy as opposed to just regular bumpy!
You must try this drive!",5
Local Flavor,"This byway is absolutely scenic, but the park service should provide warning signs for those entering Fish Creek Hill past Tortilla Flat en route to Apache Lake that this one-lane, steep, washboard-laden, guard rail-less dirt road is almost impassable when pulling a boat. A simple sign with a red skull embossed over truck-boat combo on a steep incline would be sufficient and cost effective. After all, the rescues along this stretch must cost the state a pretty penny. Once past Canyon Lake, there is no place to turn around. Period. Not for the faint of heart or iffy of brake.",3
Local Flavor,"I tried to prepare myself for the ride on the Apache Trail by reading reviews from several websites but no matter how much you think you're prepared you will be surprised by this road.   I have to say this road is NOT for the faint of heart.  It is a very beautiful drive but also can be terrifying.  We rented a mid size SUV and now wished we would have just got a full size sedan.   A car can make it just fine.   Like other reviews have stated the road is paved until just after Tortilla Flat.   Then dirt road for the next twenty or so miles.   Some spots are smoother than others but you will really only be able to drive between 10 - 20 mph and it is shaky the whole way.  The scenery is second to none however.   I have lived in Phoenix over 25 years and cannot believe I have never been on this road.  It is so beautiful   You will drive up high cliffs and down to lake level.   You will pass by Canyon, Apache and Roosevelt Lakes.  The various colors of the desert are simply gorgeous.   The advice I can give most is make sure your car is in GOOD WORKING ORDER.   You DO NOT want to break down on this road.   There are desolate stretches where you do not see other people or cars for miles.  You feel like you are the last person on earth.   Take the ride, it's a fantastic Wild West adventure.",5
Local Flavor,"Drove the whole loop recently, taking 88 from Apache Junction to 188 to US 60 back toward Sun Valley. It was only the first hour or so of driving that was interesting. The narrows on the Salt River were my favorite part. There's a scenic viewpoint atop a knob in the dirt road section. Great views down into the canyon form there. The Superstition Mountains were fun to see, too.

The rest of the trip to me was forgettable. Didn't find Apache Lake or Roosevelt Lake interesting. Total time 5 hours including stops. Wish I'd turned back after the Salt River canyon and made it 3. Or spent more time going down into the canyon.

FInally, a note for people wondering about the dirt road: Yes, there's a stretch of about 20 miles where the surface is compacted dirt and gravel. There's a lot of hype here and on other sites about how dangerous and frightening it is. Let me put it into perspective this way: On an offroad difficulty scale of 1 to 10, this route's a 1. If you have any kind of familiarity with driving unpaved roads you will be fine. But if you're the kind of clown who could never master parallel parking or backing up in a straight line, or you're a geezer in a big RV, you should probably let someone else drive.",4
Local Flavor,There is not to much to do in Arizona. So we went for a scenic drive and it was pretty. The roads can be kind of scary.,4
Local Flavor,"Den bisherigen lobenden amerikanischen Beiträgen kann ich mich nur anschließen. Eine Fahrt über den Apache Trail ist ein optisches Erlebnis der Extraklasse.

Von Apache Junction führt die State Route 88 gen Osten. Diese Straße wird allerdings nur ""Apache Trail"" genannt. Das hat seinen geschichtlichen Hintergrund bei den Apache-Indianern, die vormals einen gleichliegenden Pfad zur Überquerung der Berge nutzten.

Die ersten Meilen ab Apache Junction (für nicht Informierte: dies ist ein kleines Städtchen in Arizona) sind wenig beeindruckend. Allerdings ist das Bergpanorama, auf das man zufährt, schon mehrere Fotomotive wert. Nach einigen Meilen links die Goldfield Ghost Town, kurz danach auf der rechten Seite der ""Dutchman Statepark"" mit einem gleichnamigen, sehr empfehlenswerten Campground.

Dann windet sich die Straße die Berge hinauf. Jede Menge Kurven, Steigungen, Abfahrten wechseln sich ab. Die Landschaft hat karges Wüstenklima, überall stehen die mannshohen (und höher) Saguaro-Kakteen. Einmal im Jahr, im Frühjahr jedoch erblüht die Landschaft für kurze Zeit - wir erlebten dies in diesem Jahr im April. Leider erlaubt die Straße nur an wenigen Stellen einen Halt, um in Ruhe zu schauen und Fotos zu schießen. Kurz vor Erreichen des Canyon Lakes liegt auf der rechten Seite ein Scenic Outlook. Unbedingt halten! Von hier aus hat man einen wunderbaren Blick hinunter auf den Stausee, den man dann nach wenigen Meilen erreicht. Vorher heißt es noch, eine einspurige Metallbrücke zu queren. 

Am Canyon Lake gibt es mehrere Rastplätze direkt am Ufer. Unterstände, Grillplätze, Bänke machen den Lake zu einem beiliebten Ausflugsziel. Baden gut möglich, Entspannen vor dem tollen Panorama ebenso. 

Wir haben die Tour mit einem Wohnmobil (RV) gemacht. Das geht bis hierher auch recht gut. Kurz nach dem Canyon Lake jedoch verwandelt sich die gut ausgebaute Straße in eine unpaved road, also Sandpiste und ist für Wohnmobile nicht mehr geeignet. PKWs sollen angeblich wenig Probleme haben, außer einem Härtetest für die Stoßdämpfer. Rundweg war folglich für uns nicht möglich, also hieß es zurück und die Landschaft aus der entgegen gerichteten Perspektive noch einmal genießen. Auch nicht schlecht!

Höchstwertung für diese Straße von mir.",5
Local Flavor,"WARNING: THIS IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART OR DRIVERS THAT ARE NOT CONFIDENT OR ARE PRONE TO BOUTS OF EXTREME STUPIDITY!!!!

CELL PHONES WILL NOT WORK HERE DUE TO THE CANYON WALLS AND REMOTE LOCATION!!!! YOU SCREW UP, YOU'RE GONE BRO!

The 88 past Tortilla Flats is a long, barely maintained road that has many hairpin turns and narrow passage ways (and bridges) that lack guard rails or other standard safety features. Looking over the edges in some places will reveal to the viewer countless rusted out cars that have taken the plunge and been unable to be recovered... In fact... I know of a few nice model Ts out there ;) Should be a classic car graveyard and historical site.

However, traveling cautiously, and not in a drunken speeding stupor, will yield AMAZING vistas and glimpses into a world otherwise unable to be seen. This is truly a lost world and a fantastic one at that.

Stop in Tortilla Flats for lunch and travel on to view the Roosevelt Dam, take the road towards Globe to head to the Tonto National Monument or head the opposite direction to book it to Payson and a few smaller blink and you miss them one horse cow towns that have all but been lost to history at this point.",5
Local Flavor,"Incredible. Some of these views rival the Grand Canyon. Being a local, I sometimes forget how pretty the desert can be. 

I'd drive the trail from Apache Junction to Globe and then take US 60 from Globe to return to the Valley. That way, the canyon dropoffs are to your left. Your cell phone will probably not work much past Canyon Lake/Tortilla Flats. The road's really windy, but follow the posted speed limits and you'll be fine. If you get easily carsick, this probably isn't a great drive for you. There's not much in the way of services, so gas up ahead of time (and possibly pack snacks). 

The road's unpaved for about 20 mi after Tortilla Flats. I'd recommend driving in an SUV (or something similar with four-wheel drive) or just be prepared for a super bumpy ride. If you have doubts about your car making it on the unpaved road, I'd turn around at Canyon Lake or Tortilla Flats.

These views are worth the white knuckle driving! Bring patience and a good camera!",5
Local Flavor,"This was a great drive and we recommend to not stop at the tortilla flat, keep driving to see beautiful natural mountains. What a great way to get away!",4
Local Flavor,"Gorgeous views of the Arizona hills for the low cost of a couple of gallons of gas? Yep.  Took my wife on this drive, starting in Apache Junction and took it the full 50 miles to Roosevelt Dam. 

A couple of things to note: The road is fully paved for the first 30 or so miles but the last 22 are unpaved and about 1 1/4 car width wide at points. This is not for the inexperienced driver or someone intimidated by cliffs without guard rails.

Some posts warned about the road being rough - which it was at times (bone jarring) but we made the trek in a 2013 Prius without any issues. Sure you will be doing 5 mph in places, but we never ran into a section of road that we thought we couldn't make it. 

Overall a great drive with fantastic views. A very unique experience - only caveat is my wife was bored the last 10 miles or so as the scenery started to look all the same. But we highly recommend it none-the-less.",5
Local Flavor,"The scenery gets five stars and the safety gets one star. I will go into detail, but here it is in a nutshell. Take this road from Apache Junction until you get to Tortilla Flat. Have lunch at Tortilla Flat, enjoy Canyon Lake and then turn around. I repeat. Turn around. 

IMPORTANT TIPS: If you don't think this warning is serious and you insist on making the entire drive, make sure you have an SUV with 4WD and a driver with a steady hand and a good driving record. The entire drive will easily take you four hours and you will be in major trouble if there is any sort of weather (rain, snow) or it just rained, so make sure you travel in good weather conditions. Check your brakes and make sure your car is in good working condition before you leave. You won't have phone service and there isn't any civilization to save you if you get stranded or in an accident.

DIRECTIONS. Coming from Phoenix/Scottsdale/Tempe, take US 60 East to Idaho Road and then follow the signs to Apache Trail. Turn right when you get to the fork in the road along US 88. Enjoy the drive, but don't be an accidental daredevil like myself and take the dirt road. Be warned that if you do insist on taking the entire trail, including the dirt road, once you get to Roosevelt Lake, you'll have the option to go left or right. If you go left, you will end up on the Bee Line just outside of Payson and you'll have a 79 mile drive back to Phoenix. 

Apache Junction to Tortilla Flat 

Up until we reached Tortilla Flat, it was a beautiful drive. There were canyons, huge rock formations and mossy mountains. Along the road we stopped at Goldfield Ghost Town, Canyon Lake and Tortilla Flat. There are also several areas to park your car and walk around, including Lost Dutchman State Park which is only worth driving into if you'd like to do a little hike and have a picnic. 

Goldfield Ghost Town is cheesy and touristy but it's an authentic ghost town and the remains of a mining town from the turn of the Century. They also offer horseback rides, mining tours and train rides.

Fish Creek Hill

Don't take the dirt road to Fish Creek Hill unless you are ok with putting your life in danger. We didn't take the warnings seriously because the warnings were practically non-existent. I am completely shocked that they don't have warning signs or even a park ranger that verbally goes over the dangers you are about to undertake if you proceed to Fish Creek Hill. 

This dirt road is a one-lane, steep and very dangerous road that goes straight down. You only have enough room for one car with a mountain on one side and a steep cliff that drops several hundred feet on the other side. There are several switch backs and you can only pray that someone isn't coming around the corner going the other way when you make the turn. One wrong turn of your wheel, an issue with your brakes or skid of your tires (and remember it's a loose dirt road) and you're over the cliff without a prayer to save you. 

This continues for 22 miles. 22 miles! It gets very slightly better every now and then, but the initial steep road down to the base isn't worth the beauty of the drive. It's suicidal to do this drive and it just doesn't seem to end. Just when you think you're in the clear, it continues and it took us nearly three hours to get through. Three hours of complete fear. It's so dangerous that you can't even really take in the beauty because you're too focused on not making a wrong move. 

If you want to see the other side of the Apache Trail, instead of taking the dirt road of Fish Creek Hill, save the other side for another day and take the Bee Line to US 80 towards Roosevelt Dam. There isn't much but the dam and Roosevelt Lake is worth seeing (there is also a restaurant overlooking the Lake). 

Beauty Highlights:

- Most of the Fish Creek Hill road is along a lake so it's a watery drive. 
- There are a ton of peaks and Valleys with several cliffs, beautiful rock formations and a cave to explore. 
- It really captures the beauty of Arizona
- You get to see how much water Arizona actually has.",3
Local Flavor,"This was one of those AMAZING experiences that as you are living it you know you will talk about it for a long time. 
We started on the trail at apache junction at about noon. We got back on the freeway at 5:15. We didn't stop at any of the tourist stops except to hit the bathroom and to grab a bag of chips and a soda- we did stop at all the vistas  and look outs. 
We had a blast looking at the scenery and stopped at many of the turnouts to climb and snap photos. 
The drive down to Fish Creek was INSANE. absolutely crazy.  The guard rails looked liked cardboard and staples. We laughed like crazy until we had to go back up and  we were on the outside.  We have a big  SUV and we had to scoot over a few time a for big SUVs and trucks. We did it. 
When you drive out and start on the paved road with the switch backs you wonder how the people driving back out are driving so fast.  You find out quick that once you navigate fish creek you can do just about anything. 
We made it to Apache Lake and stopped by the store for sodas and  chips before heading back to Chandler. 
We had a blast. The scenery was breathtaking- something to cherish. 
DO THIS. IT'S worth it.",5
Local Flavor,"This was the best!  I almost didn't make this trip because of all the terrible reviews of how treacherous the path is. ""It's not for the faint of heart,"" they said.  ""Terrifying drops.""  Ok, ok, yes it did have a few scary place, yes the road becomes unpaved and one way, but with some careful driving in a few places, this byway is NOT to be missed.  If it was raining or bad weather, I probably wouldn't go too far past Tortilla Flat. In fact, if it's raining I bet you couldn't because even when I was there the road was a tidbit flooded and though I ignored the signs that said do not cross, I bet if it was raining you wouldn't even be able to anyway.  On a sunny day in March I made the trek in an economy rental car! It was GORGEOUS!!!

The Apache Trail was a stagecoach trail that ran through the Superstition Mountains. It was named the Apache Trail after the Apache Indians who originally used this trail to move through the Superstition Mountains. The Trail winds steeply through 40 miles of rugged desert mountains, past deep reservoir lakes like Canyon Lake and Apache Lake. The narrow, winding road is unpaved from just east of the town of Tortilla Flat to Roosevelt Dam; there are steep cliff drops and little in the way of safety barriers. The trail requires caution when driving. All the more reason to travel it, right?  I've driven through snowy mountains, up Pike's Peak, through flooded bridges, over terraces, gotten stuck in the mud..oh the adventures of driving. If you can handle that kind of stuff, you can handle the Apache Trail. 

There are plenty of places to pull off along the route and there was very little traffic when I was en route. Make sure to fill up that gas tank!  I'll admit, it took me at least 4 hours to get to Globe but I stopped quite a few times.  My first stop was in Apache Junction at this cutesy little visitors center.  It was a nice way to get my feet wet.  Walk around, look at some old buildings. I was there pretty early so the building was still closed but it was beautiful and informative.  I drove for a while, just making quick stops along the road and made another longer stop at Tortilla Pass for a bathroom break and Prickly Pear Gelato. Who cares if it was 10 a.m.  There is also a little store there and a restaurant so if you have the time, I'd stop in for a bite to eat.  The restaurant is the only place that has a restroom so you might have to stop in anyway.  I was kind of in a hurry to get to Globe for work.

You know you're getting closer to the end when you see Roosevelt's Dam.  Theodore Roosevelt Dam is a dam on the Salt River. It is 357 feet high and forms Theodore Roosevelt Lake. The dam is named after then-President Theodore Roosevelt. Serving mainly for irrigation water supply and flood control, the dam also has a hydroelectric generating capacity of 36 megawatts.  Prior to completion of the bridge in October 1990, traffic drove over the top of the dam. The bridge itself earned rare distinction when the bridge was named one of the top 12 bridges in the nation in November 1995. The American Consulting Engineers Council cited the bridge for overall design, size, eye-appeal and design challenge. Other bridges cited were the Golden Gate Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge. 

After the bridge, you have about 10 or so minutes before hitting Globe.  Again, so worth it. I've never seen this type of landscape, where cacti litter the hills like the trees of the Black Hills. There wasn't any animal sitings, but still, very very beautiful.  I would do it again and again.  If I lived in Phoenix, this would be a nice, free, getaway. I'd probably pack up the family, drive the Tortilla Pass for food and ice cream and make my way back. I did notice that near Roosevelt Dam there was some boating activity as well.  Don't be afraid, experience!!",5
Local Flavor,"We drove from the beginning of the park to Tortilla Flats. We decided not to go any further because of the reviews about the road being not suitable for sedans. The road to Tortilla Flats was an easy ride, just keep your eyes on the road, steep cliffs on the side of the road, you can see some rusty cars down at the bottom that have crashed down.",5
Local Flavor,"We just did this drive. The views are absolutely spectacular. There is probably nowhere else on the planet quite like it. If you love mountains and saguaros, this drive is for you. It was not as scary as the other reviews make it seem if you take the curves slowly and make sure to let your husband know when you want him to slow down a bit. :) But, the last half of it is not paved. It is very dusty, very bumpy, very curvy, and very far. Plan to take about 3-4 hours one way, and I would recommend a practical vehicle such as an SUV. And cell service is pretty nonexistent. We has planned on doing the drive then doing it back the way we came, but after getting to the dam, we decided we couldn't do it again the other way so we are going up to Payson to get back to scottsdale. It is longer in miles but significantly faster, I'm certain. I think you should do this drive exactly one time. No more, no less.",4
Local Flavor,"Holy **** bring diapers and or Xanax to ride the apache trail. Lol just kidding...mostly. My parents came to visit me in Scottsdale for a weekend, and we are all from the east coast where the scenic views consist of looking out the car window while stuck in traffic on the George Washington bridge. My mom insisted we ride the Apache Trail as I had been telling her for a couple of weeks how cool it seemed.

I warned my parents it might be a bit scary, but off we went. The paved portion of the trail I hands down recommend to anyone as the views are unbelievable and the road isn't very scary. The unpaved portion is more of a once in a lifetime experience as it is pretty scary, and did get sort of crowded on a nice weekend day. With that being said this was probably one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen and 100 percent worth every second of fear and white knuckling of the seat cushion. 

Unless you're really jaded you can't be bored on the trail, the views, mountains, cacti, and lakes were unbelievable. We went in the fall but I can't imagine how awesome it must look in the superstitions when all the flowers are blooming. Also I'm not a history buff at all but the history of the area and the fact that this was used as a stagecoach trail a hundred years ago is like the most fascinating thing to me.",5
Local Flavor,"Alright, here's the situation. I'm not reviewing the Apache Trail scenic road poorly because of it's views, because I am certain they are spectacular throughout the entire drive. I am reviewing it poorly because the idea that the Apache Trail is classified as a actual highway is ludicrous and I would argue dangerous -at least for certain folks.

Recently, I decided to take a scenic drive back from the Grand Canyon with my mom and we decided to come down through eastern Arizona. Now on any map or GPS, state route 88 shows up as a NORMAL road on a map, which you can take after seeing Lake Roosevelt in order to shave time off of the drive and not have to continue down state route 188. 

After seeing this road come up, we decided to head over by the dam in order to stop for some pictures before making our way along route 88 heading south. So we began the way up to the actual road, twisting along a paved (with no railing) 1 and 1/2 (and I'm being generous) lane road. 

After about 3 minutes on the road I see a large sign saying ""end pavement for next 22 miles"". At this point my mom is freaking out because I dragged us up this steep and non-railed section of road that ends with what looks like an unpaved road made for ATV's or dirt bikes. (I cannot believe anyone who isn't an off-road enthusiast or at least sponsored by Red Bull or Monster would actually drive this road, it looks like something you would see in Bolivia). 

Anyway, I had to calm my mom down, turn the rental car back around, head back out to the main road, and subsuquently drive way out of our way to get us back to Phoenix. The road did become scenic again, taking us through the enjoyable ""Devils Canyon"" before getting us home so in the end it all worked out. 

But I have to say, I have lived in Arizona my whole life and have never heard about this ""road"" that in my view, should not be for cars or at the very least should be completed and widened more, paved, and with rails. While we were there I saw an small RV and a Chevy Suburban also pull up, see the dirt road, and turn back around.

In the end, I came home and researched more about the Apache Trail (and even found articles documenting people who recently veered off of the ""road"" and died) and have come to the conclusion that this road, at least in my opinion, should be CLEARLY marked not as a highway but as an unpaved expert trail and there should be warnings regarding this road along state route 188 for novices who might think it's an actual road they can take to get back to Phoenix. 

I'm sure the views are amazing from the inside (save for the driver who is not going to be able to enjoy the views while navigating), but to display the Apache Trail as a real highway for people to use is irresponsible and potentially dangerous. I have travelled throughout Latin America on busses with bad breaks and have rarely seen roads that dangerous with no protection or railing with no space to navigate or turn around. Heaven forbid if you were to encounter inclement weather while on the Apache Trail you would be in a world of trouble.",1
Local Flavor,"The Apache Trail was not scary AT ALL. After reading the reviews on here, i was ready for a once-in-a-lifetime scare of a drive, but that was not the case whatsoever. Sure it was unpaved and the roads got slim, but if you're at least an average driver, this was not scary or super abnormal.

Beautiful drive! I would recommend turning around after the bend (in the photos I've posted). There's not much new scenery after that.",5
Local Flavor,My wife and I drove the Apache trail this weekend. We loved every minute of it. Got to break in the new Jeep on some of the  trails along the way. First stop at the ghost town was really enjoyable. Lunch at tortilla flats was nice. The scenery is incredible. I recommend a full day to stop frequently and be sure to visit all three lakes along the way. Roosevelt lake at sunset was the perfect way to finish.,5
Local Flavor,"I left Phoenix for Oklahoma City in 2011 because of the economic crisis, and returned to visit in November of 2014. Before going, I knew I was going to have to make time for the Apache Trail. In Oklahoma I'd been so used to the sweeping vistas of... horizon. So yeah, I needed to escape from civilization and engage in something profound, philosophical and spiritual. There's something about the elegant mix of a winding, rough road weaving around hills and mountains amidst steep valleys and desert forest that really sticks to your soul. I usually feel I'm one to rush through life, but this place is quite humbling to me, hearing nothing but Sonoran winds and seeing a different scene at every bend; it stops me from being somewhere and makes me just be. The drive can be a bit tense in parts, but it's otherwise a majestic example of the pageantry of nature, and is well worth the time and low speed limits. There are few places I've been that I find utterly serene, but this is one of them, and there are fortunately plenty of spots to pull over to take in the view and take your time to enjoy this experience.",5
Local Flavor,"Very nice drive. The dirt road is not all bad. It is bumpy at times, but I averaged 15-20 mph, made several stops to take photos, and it took 3 hours to go from Tortilla flat to the dam. 

I had a lot of fear as I entered the trail, but at the end I was amazed at how easy it was.

The vehicle that I drove was a 2014 Hyundai Accent",5
Local Flavor,"Gorgeous drive!  We were so glad we didn't listen to the reviews about not taking the dirt section of the road.  If you have driven canyon roads or dirt roads, you will not find the road fearful or uncomfortable.  The road may be white-knuckled for someone who hasn't had a lot of experience driving in canyons.

There are a few places in the road that are definitely one-car, but this does not happen very much.  The other cars were very courteous and we only had to pull to the side 2 or 3 times to let a car by our entire drive.  Most of the road is easily passable for 2 cars.  There is one narrow section with a steep drop-off, but this area did have guard rails and did not last long.  Drive from Apache Junction to Roosevelt Dam and you will drive on the inside of the road away from the drop-offs. 

Additionally, you do not need a 4 wheel drive or high-clearance vehicle.  We found the road to be a nicely graded dirt road (which of course will have some washboard sections) and there were very few ruts to avoid.

We have driven the road to Hana in Maui, up Pike's Peak in Colorado and through the countryside in England.  All of these are far more harrowing than the Apache Trail.",5

Local Flavor,"Crossing the Superstition Mountains has always been a perilous journey. Bravely, I made the daring drive through the ancient caldera, past a chain of deep reservoirs, down the precipitous Fish Creek Hill, and eventually to historic Theodore Roosevelt Dam.    

To build the dam, engineers in the first decade of the 20th Century constructed the Apache Trail (Arizona Highway 88). Today, the narrow road remains unpaved for 20 miles, from just east of Tortilla Flat to Roosevelt Dam.

The single-lane road clutched the steep wall of Fish Creek Canyon as it dropped 900 feet in just one mile. It reminded me of those terrifying third-world roads cut out of a cliff face, and driven by maniacal bus drivers carrying their equally insane passengers. At the bottom of the hill, a small wooden bridge crossed Fish Creek, and a short rocky trail led to a gaping shallow cave. 

The coarse dirt road returned to smooth pavement at Roosevelt Dam, once the largest stone masonry dam in the world. I stopped at vista points on both sides of the dam to fully appreciate this civil engineering marvel. Downstream, I realized the size of the impressive structure, and could see the power plant and spillway. Upstream, I observed some of the original stone masonry, and admired the elegant Roosevelt Lake Bridge, the longest two-lane, single-span, steel-arch bridge in North America.

Along the Apache Trail, I experienced dazzling volcanic rock formations, shimmering blue-green lakes, dizzying white-knuckle driving, and amazing feats of engineering achievement. At the end of the day, I felt like an intrepid adventurer, after surviving my daring drive across the Superstition Mountains.",4
Local Flavor,"Absolutely amazing with a side of stunning views!  I hadn't been on the Apache Trail in 15 years, so decided to take the hubby on a little daytrip excursion.  We picked an absolutely beautiful day and headed up on the 202 to explore.  I recommend only taking the trail through the paved roads...who needs to go further when the views are so amazing on the paved road?!?  We stopped several times to walk and take photos...why not?",5
Local Flavor,"Ol Dog gave this 5 stars because I'm glad i survived it! 

Had to keep the paws on the wheel, and kept looking right; as it is vertigo inducing, claustrophobic and if one is scared of heights, I strongly advise against going. No guard rails and narrow dirt roads for 22 miles not for the faint hearted.

Once I got to Payson i barked a sigh of relief!",5
Local Flavor,"My husband and I drove the Apache Trail this afternoon.  I must admit I had no idea what we are in for!  After seeing the Grand Canyon yesterday I thought that nothing could impress me, but the scenery along this trail was incredible.  We live in NY, and I'm not a fan of western movies, so I had no idea that such roadways exist.  That we decided to do this drive in our rental, convertible VW Bug still has me laughing at our stupidity!  We stopped at all of the tourist destinations at the beginning of the trail and had lunch on the water at Canyon Lake.  All enjoyable.

I then, unknowingly, started on the most terrifying ride of my life.  If you have any anxiety issues what-so-ever, load up on Xanax or have several drinks before getting into the passenger seat (trust me, you will thank me for this advice).  By the time we hit the unpaved section of the road I was begging my husband to slow down and look at the road.  He pulled over, got out of the car and said you **** drive.  GLADLY I thought!!!  Nope, not much better, I was terrified and doing about 5 mph.  By the time we made it to the dam we were no longer speaking to each other!!!  That said, I'm so glad we did it!  Can't imagine missing that scenery.  Pictures can't capture it.  I'd love to camp near one of the lakes.",4
Local Flavor,"Just returned from a lovely day traveling the Apache Trail.  We had gone last winter, but only went as far as Canyon Lake due to a late start so we made sure to allow more time today.  After Tortilla Flat the road becomes dirt.  Warning: as previous reviewers have stated, this drive is not for the faint of heart.  It is long, steep, and intense.  But it is gorgeous.  I grew up driving/riding mountain roads and it was still one of the scariest roads I've ever been on.  The views and scenery are unlike anything I've ever seen.  After the drop to fish creek (the best part) it does seem to take forever to get to Roosevelt Lake.  Still gorgeous though.  We did the full circle and from Apache Junction back to Mesa took us 5 hours, with only a couple stops.  Not something I would do very often but that's what makes it so special!  If you're up for an adventure then do not miss this beautiful trail!  Be smart and careful and you will enjoy it.",5
Local Flavor,"Again, another fun surprise, with some updates.  The previous reviews did describe a lot of what happens on this trail.  The mountain views are absolutely breath-taking.  However, what IS MISSING from the reviews is the time needed.  We took advantage of the speediest drive in the safest way possible and visit each of the sites: Apache Junction, Goldfield Mining Town, views of the Superstition Mountains, Canyon Lake, Tortilla Flat, Tonto National Park, Apache Lake, Roosevelt Dam and the long drive back to Phoenix.  Other review say you can make the drive anywhere from 2-7hrs.  Well, we just finished the trail in a Ford Escape 4cylinder SUV and it took 6.5 hrs.  Our stops equaled about 1hr and the rest was driving time.  Most reviews mention the 'rough roads' but failed to fully prepare us with the details of these rough roads.  The details you should know about are the DIRT ROAD from mile marker 221-249... 28miles of graded dirt roads.  Most of the road had very rough tracks from some sort of heavy equipment and made travelling VERY SLOW.  At times, our top speed was 10mph.  With the combination of the dirt road, slow speed, heavy road vibration, occasional lane narrowing to fit only one car at a time, and the magnificent view, plan on driving only 10-15mph; any faster is a death warrant.  Once you get to Roosevelt Dam, you'll be out of interesting sights to see but the speed limit then goes to 60mph",4
Restaurants,"BoCa7 is an exotic Vietnamese restaurant that offers the traditional specialty of 7 courses of beef and fish.  As soon as you enter the space, you are enveloped in a sea of red... from the red orbs of light from above to the red mosaic tiling on the walls.  This place has a very bright and friendly feel while still maintaining a sense of the exotic.

The food is also fabulous--they offer a variety of dishes other than the 7 courses of beef and fish option.  Being a fan of red meat, I tried the cubed beef tenderloin with garlic and onions--this is served with a watercress salad and rice.  The slightly sweet and peppery marinated meat simply melts in your mouth.  

We also ordered one of the house specialties, the crispy skin oven roasted whole Catfish sprinkled with crushed peanuts, scallions, and carmelized onions. This dish is phenomenal and unlike any fish that I have had.  What I really enjoyed was the crispiness of the skin.  The Catfish meat was also very soft and delicate.  The dish is served with rice paper, mints, mixed greens, green banana and apple slices, and bean sprouts which you use to wrap the fish in.  

They also serve a variety of traditional desserts and specialty drinks, such as freshly squeezed coconut juice with lime.

It opened its doors just about two weeks ago and if the food is this good now, it can only get better.  It was late Saturday night when I dined here, and there were still a number of patrons in the restaurant.  If you want to try some non-typical Vietnamese food in a friendly, chill environment, this is a great pick.",5
Restaurants,"I just moved to Arizona from San Diego where there are a lot of good  Vietnamese's food, and I was eager to find a good place here. I found Bo Ca 7 through yelp and I'm not disappointed at all! This is one of the nicest Vietnamese restaurant that I have ever been to. 

Decor : 5 stars 

Atmosphere and music selection: 5star, it's a blend of slow Vietnamese music and soft rock. I was just so happy that it's not those cheesy 80's music every VN restaurant play. 

Service : 5 stars, okay, for a vietnamese joint it's super !  they actually refilled my water, came out and ask me what else i needed. it's actually so nice here i felt embarrass about screaming "" table for two please"" at the waitress from across the room. you can't blame me if you've been to a typical vietnamese restaurant. 

Food : Now this is the most important part.  4 1/2 star, I thought that the food was very good. Not the best that i have tasted, but it's very clean and very fresh. my husband ordered a Chao Ca which is  fish congee or porridge. It was a nice size, very good ,but it looks very plain. Usually we get a side dish of bean sprouts, lemon, and some cilantro; but it didn't have that. We had to ask for it. which is fine, but for those people who never had it before they would be missing out on the veggie side dish which i think is very important in vietnamese cuisine. I ordered the rice with fried fish and house sauce. when they first brought it out i thought that's it? to my surprise that's just perfect, really light and fresh suitable for a summer day. 

pricing: it's a bit more than most Vietnamese joint but it's about the same if you had gone to a Thai Restaurant. i would gladly pay for the service and atmosphere here.

in the end i left this place really please !!! count on me to be a regular!!",5
Restaurants,"Based on décor alone, Boca 7 would get four stars for all its fish-out-of-water glam in Mesa.  The design work by the dentist/co-owner is totally over the top.  The devil is in the details and a few of them need tweaking.  The heights of the black crystal chandeliers and huge red fabric spheres need to be varied to make the ceiling look less cluttered.  This place is also in desperate need of a dimmer switch.  It is tradition that Asian restaurants be lit like they're in the middle of a raid to emphasize that they are clean, but all those chandeliers blazing on high are too much at Boca 7.  The screw heads used to affix the huge Asian symbols to the back wall also need to be hidden.  And what's with putting the cheapest paper napkins on the market on the granite tables?  When you've spent this much money on the interior, either get a nice paper napkin or splash out for cloth napkins.  

Unfortunately, the food does not live up to the decor.  Compared to a Vietnamese gem like Cyclo, the food here is a bit of a disappointment.  There's nothing wrong with it, but this is the food I would expect to find in a very traditional Vietnamese restaurant.  However, this setting makes me expect something much more modern.  Perhaps the owners should look to Jin Ju in Chicago as a template to follow as I think that restaurant is much closer to the concept of mod Asian fare in a hip setting that would work for them.  Now whether or not that concept will actually work in Mesa is another question altogether.   

The menu is a hoot.  It's filled with advertising and reads like a gay who's who of Phoenix dentists and bankruptcy lawyers.  This place is worth a visit just to check out the décor.  If Liberace had been Vietnamese, this could have been his restaurant.",3
Restaurants,"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. Boca 7 is like a paradise of color walking through the doors. Rich reds, blacks, and golds. You can tell the decor was well thought out and executed. Walking through the doors to see this wasn't something I expected to see in Mesa or Arizona in general. The decor alone stood out as being on par with high end restaurants you see in larger cities. 

I shared the 7 course beef meal for two. The 1st course was a beef salad with a sweet vinegar type sauce and rice type crackers. The tastes and textures alone stood out as something very unique and different. The second course came with rice paper, thinly sliced beef, and an array of vegetables and herbs to create your own spring rolls. They brought out a pot of boiling vinegar liquid (it's good!) to cook the beef in. The rest of the dishes were fabulous as well. 

The wait staff was extremely attentive and very nice. VERY VERY nice! They went above and beyond any restaurant I've been to in a really long time. One of the waitresses showed us how to eat and prepare everything since we were new and didn't know much. The entire experience was personable and inviting. 

I ordered a Vietnamese black coffee without sugar as well. It definitely tasted french pressed and was the best coffee I've had at a restaurant. I was in heaven. 

The owner came over to us multiple times throughout the meal and asked how everything was. She was so nice & you could really tell they truly gave an immense amount of attention to excellent service, decor, and presentation. 

I'd highly recommend this place to everyone!!",5
Restaurants,"This place was great in every aspect;  food, decor, service, and price.

We did their 7 course beef meal for two and were pleasantly surprised.  Each dish was very different and unique employing a wide variety of very fresh ingredients and taste combination.  It was the perfect amount of food for two people, bordering on too much.

Service was spot on.  Very attentive, friendly, helpful, and very knowledgeable about their dishes and how they are traditionally consumed.  I am anxious to return and try their 7 course fish dinner.",5
Restaurants,"This place is pretty cute, good happy hour prices (4-7, 9-close), and tasty food. I had never had vietnamese before, and I was pleasantly surprised. The wait staff is a bit annoying (they kept coming to the table every 2-3 minutes or so), but other than that, definitely a good find.

The only weird thing is if you sit in the back area of the restaurant on the right, you look into a grocery store with bright lights and shoppers...it's a bit odd for a nicely appointed little restaurant.",4
Restaurants,"I ate at Bo Ca 7 again on my weekend trip to Phoenix.  It was as yummy as it was the first time.  We decided to dine outdoors since there was a loud graduation party happening inside with some not so happening music.  We ordered the freshly pressed sugarcane and kumquat juice which kept us cool and the thinly sliced beef that you cook yourself in heated vinegar and then wrap with lettuce, mints, and rice paper.  Everything was delicious and the atmosphere was lively, yet relaxed (since we sat outside).  Too bad it's so HOT in Arizona!",5
Restaurants,"New and different - 

My parents brought me here for my birthday lunch 3 weeks ago. They had been there before and they really liked it, so they thought they'd bring me back. 

The decor was pretty trendy, but a bit too much at times. The service was decent. I was given free fried ice cream for my birthday. The server said when she first asked the owner if she could give me free ice cream, the owner said no. Then the server told her my parents had been in before, and she changed her mind. I think that shows a bit of poor customer service. 

We ordered both the fish and beef 7 course meal. Both of the meats were really flavorful on their own. They also give you a regular sauce or the ""special"" sauce which is the one I like. Wrapping my meal up in the rice paper was pretty difficult, and it definitely teased my messy food phobia a little. 

Due to the distance from my parents' house, I probably won't be making it back to this place any time soon.",3
Restaurants,"The average rating for this place far exceeds my expectation. The food here is quite over priced....After spending around $50 dollars on take-out, I had the take a family of 4 to Mcdonalds. My two kids (10 and 12) were complaining about how there wasn't enough food to go around. The only thing that was good about this place was the decor and the fancy plastic carry out boxes they had.

For me, this restaurant is a once in a life time ordeal. Their food is edible, but it doesn't have anything that sets itself above the other. BoCa isn't anything new, this kind of food you can get just about anywhere for cheaper.",2
Restaurants,"This is right now my favorite restaurant. It is hard to think of all the reasons why I like it. 1. On Friday and Saturday they are open till MIDNIGHT! and till 10 on other days. They also host events and parties. 

They have Happy hour from like 3 or 4 -7 which means half off appetizers and all alcoholic drinks. Their appetizers are meals in themselves so this is really a great deal seeing that they are all 3.95 regularly so around 2 dollars at happy hour. 

Their cocktails are already pretty cheap at like I think 6 dollars, and 3 at happy hour. They also have beer, I forget which types. All of the cocktails I have had are very tasty. 

Almost all of their food is under 9 dollars, averaging around 7-8 dollars. Everything that I have tried has been amazing, well cooked and very well presented, their portion sizes are the average Asian food portion which is a lot and each meal looks and tastes like they really took time to perfect what they were making. 

The store is always clean, and the service is so friendly, more like an American food restaurant rather than the reserved waiters you usually get in Asian restaurants. The ambiance is great, they keep the music at a good volume and seem to always be playing different stations which is fun. 

Most importantly to me is it is very vegetarian friendly. They have a part of the menu for vegetarians, with things like vegetarian curry, Tamarind Soy fish, or lemongrass soy chicken. It is great to be able to go in and order something unique rather than getting another stir fried vegi or tofu plate (as much as I love them it gets boring!) Their vegetarian meals are very well made, they don't make you feel like you are eating a substitute they feel like real meals. 

My boyfriend and my new favorite meal of all time is their Pan fried rice cakes, it is a sort of omelet with fried rice cakes that kind of have the consistency of hash browns or something, it is to die for (and only 2 dollars for a whole plate if you go during happy hour).",5
Restaurants,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! 
We had a coupon from restaruant.com. 
We went at about 1:30pm and the place was empty. 
We were immediately greeted and seated. They brought over water with cucumber in it. I love that. 
We ordered the Bot Chien (pan-fried rice cake). It was wonderful. It is served with a yummy soy dipping sauce and it really hit the spot. 
We ordered the Chicken Curry and the Tamarind Shrimp. 
The Chicken Curry is fabulous! It is a bight yellow broth with sweet potatoes, potatoes, carrots, onions and chicken. I think I might become addicted. I did have to add a little chili sauce...I like things spicy. 
The Tamarind Shrimp looked beautiful and was served with the heads on. This dish is kind of sweet, so I dipped them in the chili sauce. The only complaint I have is that the shrimp are not cleaned (aka full of poop) and they are very hard to peel. I think I would try something new next time. 
The service was spot on the entire time! 
The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated. The bathroom was spotless and actually smelled good. 
They have Happy Hour form 3-7pm and again from 9pm-close, Monday - Friday. With half price booze and starters. I will definitely be back to try that! 
I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship...",5
Restaurants,"The decor is very trendy, but I don't go to most restaurants because of the decor.  The food was very good and I would definitely come back.  I hear they have a live band every other week.",4
Restaurants,"I won't write much, because I would only be repeating what has been said here already. We tried Boca 7 today and shared the 7 course beef dinner. There was so much food, and the service was so wonderful, I kept wondering if I had read the menu right--was this $29.95 total or $29.95 per person? Well, our total bill, including drinks, came out to only $36.00! Great food, great service, and excellent prices. As an extra bonus, we discovered a very inexpensive Filipino/Hawaiian grill in the Mekong Plaza food court afterwards.",5
Restaurants,"I went for happy hour today (3-7pm). We ordered Lychee martinis that were $3.00 each. They were made with a good vodka and Lychee liquor with two Lychee fruits on a skewer. They were strong and great! 
We ordered the beef and vegetarian spring rolls ($2.00 each). The portions were HUGE! The beef is the way to go, the veg was a little bland compared to the beef. I really like this place. It is a great spot to stop before shopping at Mekong. 
Rock on Boca 7!",5
Public Services & Government,"You know, If I had the opportunity I'd give Scottsdale public works 0 stars.

How many of us find oursleves tangled up in construction on Scottsdale road, shifting lanes that seem to change overnight on a project that has been in place since LAST YEAR only to wonder why it's not done and it's  a tuesday at 3 pm and there's NO WORKERS progressing the project. 


Better yet, how about we FINISH one project BEFORE we start another, I'm sure many of you can comment on the Pinnacle Peak catastrophe which is a never ending battle as well.

Totally with you on the whole ""finish one project before starting another"", and it's 3PM and lanes are blocked off but workers and any sign of work are seemingly non-existent. It's funny how the same roads get torn up about every year or two, only to leave shoddy workmanship and ugly patchwork scars. At least, if you're going to inconvenience us for weeks and months at a time, have the work ethic and common courtesy to leave the roadway surface in as good (or, preferably better) shape than before you started digging. Please. Oh, and Scottsdale police? I reserve the right to swerve around shoddy, crappy roadwork that the city either ignores or patched up and left worse, and not have it called ""negligent driving."" We the people cite YOU the city for negligent, mismanaged chaos which not only inconveniences, but in some cases damages vehicle alignments and front-ends as we dodge and amble through this urban miasma of ineptitude. 

Here's an idea: How about making road surfaces out of materials that don't break down every couple of years? Oh, I forgot - we're spending our trillions on unnecessary warfare and waste. Remember, Rome fell partly because it couldn't build viable roads.",2

Restaurants,"We were turned onto this place by my sista on a previous trip to Montreal.  We originally wanted to check out a more ""authentic"" Chinese resto but didn't feel like trekking from our hotel over to Chinatown so instead we hopped on Le Metro over to the Eaton Centre and strolled the underground over to Place Ville Marie.  
Mr. Ma is in bldg 1 and can't be missed from the inside our out.  The restaurant is expansive but it is always quiet when we visit.  I would like to take away 1 star because they only have one highchair which was already in use, but the food is just too good.
I stuck with what I know, General Tao and DW had the Spicy Orange Chicken.  Both meals were some of the best tasting, juiciest chicken we have ever had.  Mr. Ma is a little stingy on the sauce but super tasty none the less.  One meal could easily feed two people, in fact we had quite a bit of food left over which we enjoyed back at the hotel the next day.
Most people complain that it is a little pricey.  This is some of the best Chinese food that I have had in North America so I'm certainly not going to complain about paying a few extra Canadian $$.  What else are you going to do with that pocket full of toonies? Stop being cheap and take your significant other out for some unforgettable Chinese food!",5
Restaurants,"Overall: It's good but quite expensive!

This is a chinese restaurant with a small menu with more traditionnal meal that are well done. It's more 3.5/5 because it's really well done, however, i don't understand why I should pay 21.95$ for a meal that's making lot of money if sold at 10$. I feel you're paying for the location and cleaniness of the restaurant. The service is quite fast and even though I was attending a Retirement party with a large group.

It's quite good too; General Tao, instead of using cheap chicken part, you clearly felt it was chicken breast and even chicken filet which is good. But I wasn't that impress, the small menu and the concept let me quite unmove or I shall say, unattracted on the idea of chinese restaurant with small amount of choice. Even if small menu means more control over quality, I don't feel it was worth the price.

heineken 9$
21.95$ for General Tao (approx 6-7 ounces of general tao + dry rice) hmm kinda give me the chill!",3

The service was excellent, and friendly, and the food was delicious each time we visited. It is a bit pricy, but nice restaurants in Montreal are pricey. The food arrived piping hot, and the menu had so many choices it is hard to decide what to have. The portions are quite large. If you are looking for good Chinese food, this is the one to try.",4
Restaurants,Family took me to Mr. Ma's and it was exceptional. Really good chinese and very delicious. My family goes there a lot since they conduct business nearby so they frequent it all the time. Everything on the menu is delicious.,5
Restaurants,Quite disappointing. Went for a business lunch and got this watery fish that was bland tasting.  The service however was good and the appetizers weren't too bad.,2
Restaurants,So good we ate here twice. Best dumplings ever had outside of Hong Kong-- with huge chunks of chicken and delicate wrappers. Other fab starters-- the vegetables in lettuce wrappers and roast pork loin. Don't event bother with the main courses.,5
Restaurants,"What to say about Mr Ma, on the plus side it is one of the classiest Chinese restaurant in Montreal especially since Piment Rouge has closed and well located downtown in PVM. The menu is pretty much your typical Chinese american restaurant (aka not super authentic) and I could probably say it is the best general Tao chicken in town if that's what you're into. I do mean it, the pieces are quite large with real juicy chicken and lightly breaded so will not give you a stomach ache but it will cost you 30$ after tax and tip",3
Public Services & Government,"It sucks to have jury duty but the jury center at the Phoenix Municipal Court was really nice and helped turn around what I thought was going to be an even crappier day. The staff were really nice and helpful. The place is built almost like a movie theater. There are about 250 seats all facing a bunch of flat panel LCDs. The facility was clean and felt brand new.  On one of the flat panel TVs they display the status of the cases. So you know how many cases they have left that may need jurors. As soon as that number hits zero they say it is time to go home. It was VERY helpful to have some kind of a status indication because it lets me know something is happening. They played 3-4 movies on the other TVs. And the movies were all fairly recent. I thought the movies were going to be old ones or boring, but these were all good and a couple I hadn't seen before. 

I would recommend bringing a laptop or smart phone to help keep you connected to your world while you are waiting on someone else's. They have 4 computers there that you can use. 

It would be nice if they have more outlets in the general seating area. Along the wall they have seats that have plugs near them, but most of the time they are full. It would be nice if they had a hand out that provided a list of nearby restaurants. All they had was a binder and it is kinda hard to go through it when somebody else is.

On your jury summons they have a map of where to park. Be sure to bring in your parking stub to have it validated.",4
Public Services & Government,"Well, I was called for jury duty and expected an experience like in the movies Runaway Jury or 12 Angry Men.  On the other hand, I didn't make it to a jury since all of the cases that day ended up being settled before going to trial (which could be seen as a good thing!).  Rather, that meant that a good chunk of my day was spent in the jury center.  

With that in mind, I was anticipating that the potential jurors would be sitting around bored in a big room all day.  That was definitely not the case!  Despite what another Yelp review stated, there was parking just across the street that was fully validated.  The staff were very personable and friendly.  There was a large room with movies on a big screen and computers to use (plus, free wifi), a quiet reading room with magazines and puzzles, and a kitchen with vending machines and complimentary coffee, tea, and hot chocolate.  Another nice convenience was that we could tell how many cases were left before we would be released.  I don't remember this from the last time I was on jury duty.  

So the next time you're called for jury duty, pack some snacks, bring a laptop, and look forward to a small vacation from work (unless you're like me and sent work e-mails from the court house).",4
Public Services & Government,"It's an okay place for a morning nap.  I wish the ""quiet"" room was a bit quieter though.  The day I was there, wireless access was down, so I could not get any real work done.  The movie was some tear-jerker with Ben Affleck.  The place is clean and comfortable. 

The staff from the security cops at the front-door to the Jury people were all top-notch.  Efficient, polite, informative, they let you know what is expected without being ugly about it.

I'd go back.  But not until I'm called again.",4
Public Services & Government,"It's sad that in a small town like ours that we can't get good service. What happened to the whole small town feel where people are usually more friendly than other places?

We were going to the county clerk to turn in our forms for our business license. My friend was there and we went there close to closing. The three of us had to be there to sign this form in front of them. The people there were staring my friend down with a look like, are you serious? Why are you still here? The guy at the counter stared her down and told her, ""30 seconds~ (pointing at his watch), we don't get paid overtime here"" and then kicked her out as soon as we arrived at 4:58 (they close at 5pm! and we had to just sign the one form in front of them). 

Man, that was so rude! We went to a notary afterwards instead. We were toting 3 little babies with us too trying to run around because they kicked us out 2 minutes early. I think they have no compassion to kick out someone when she's holding a baby in one arm and the papers in another with a diaper bag just because you can't wait more minute to stay at your job! And then my other friend went back the next day to drop off the form and she said she had really bad service also! My goodness! 

Okay, just wanted to let fellow yelpers know about our experience~",1
Public Services & Government,"Mark Sheldon has some good people working for him.

Yesterday, I got a call at 4:08 telling me that we needed to get a certain document TODAY. A cursory check of the website indicates the typical government office closing time of 4:30pm (probably the source of Hannah M.'s issues...). I grabbed the info I needed and hopped on my bike and bolted straight there. 

From downtown Champaign to the Brookens Center via Raleigh takes all of 18 minutes or so and I was sweating balls. I even cut thru the soccer fields. I ran around the center like Benjamin Braddock until I found the right place. They were (predictably) wrapping up. But I was humble and polite and guess what? They took care of me. 

Of course what I needed wasn't nearly as easy as it sounded on paper because of unforeseen issues, and the folks behind the counter had to jump through more than one hoop to make it happen, but they went that distance for me and they stuck around past close. IMMD.",5

Public Services & Government,"This is a review about my experience at The Clark County Recorder's/Assessor's Office having done of my 'Declared Homestead' on a property. 
**Declared Homestead- A Homestead gives protection against involuntary claims against an owner's home** 

Recently, I moved to a different property and I was receiving several letters in the mail from all different companies explaining the benefits of homesteading. Usually, they will ask a check for $25 and after that they'll send another letter that I need to pay the extras to homestead.. I Asked all my coworkers at work and they were saying that they paid about $50 for a declaration of homestead. I thought it was a little too expensive to be recorded.. So, I researched and I found out that I can go to Clark County Recorder's/Assessor's Office and they can do it for me from there! 

1) I went to the Recorder's Office (located on the 2nd Floor), filled out the form. 

2) After filling out the form , I had to go the Assessor's Office which is located right next to the Recorder's office & I signed it in front of a notary. They are offering a FREE of charge to do a notary on Fridays :) You can ask a person to make sure that the information of your property is correct and up-to-date. If you ask, they will tell you the real value of your property on both last year's and this year's (for your tax purposes). 

3) A person at the Recorder's, she/he recorded my declaration of homestead and everything was done in less than 20min. I paid ONLY $14 in cash( they accept the major credit cards but if you use it, they will charge a fee of $3.50. It's better to pay in cash and get a receipt). 
It's been signed, notarized , & recorded! 

I find that the people who work at this place are all efficiently helpful and are willing to take the time to answer my questions( I had tons of questions to ask as usual, LOL). In my experience, it is best go there as early in the morning as possible to avoid a long line. I was there around @9am and there were only a few people waiting. The parking is FREE, don't need to feed the meters, yay(lots of empty parking spaces). The building is very clean and nice as all the government facilities are sleek :) For a moment, I just thought about how much I hate waiting in line for several hours at the DMV.. :( 

**Just a Note** 
I'm not an expert but my understanding is that if you have a recorded homestead declaration and have a judgment against you, you can still sell your property protecting a certain amount of money as long as you purchase a replacement house prior to six months. And also it will protects the homeowner in the event the equity in the house is attacked by creditors. I think it's totally up to a person to Homestead or not. But if you decide & want to Declaration of Homestead, you can do it yourself, very easily @Clark County Recorder's/Assessor's Office, without using a professional service which charges too much and makes the benefits seem much greater than they are.",5
Public Services & Government,"I just read two of the longest reviews I've ever seen online. People, this is a government office, not a blockbuster movie!

She has instituted reforms that were long overdue.",5

Arts & Entertainment,"Cuchi-cuchi was her mantra when I used to see her on the Love Boat as a kid, and it still is.  And she looks exactly the same.

Charo is an amazing performer.  Very funny, poking fun at herself and the usual celebrity targets.  Then comes the second half of the show where she shows a side very few people know about.  She is a trained classical Spanish guitarist, a protege of none other than Andres Segovia himself.

Like so many other 'obscure' shows on the strip, this is a wonderful alternative to all the high budget shows that everyone outside of Vegas seems to hear about.  I would go again.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Last night I had the pleasure of watching Maria Rosario Pilar Martinez Molina Baeza play guitar. Okay, she also goes by ""Charo"", you know, for short. She is every bit the talent as her name is long. She is currently doing a show at the Riviera Casino here in Las Vegas.

I have never been in the Riviera before. Odd, but true. This is the most peculiar casino I have been in in Las Vegas. Once you get through the maze of stores and what-not from the back entrance, it finally opens up into a big, old fashioned casino. While walking through the place, I was thinking about how spectacular this casino must have been in its day. I got an erie feeling that the ghost of Las Vegas past was lurking around in there. It is like walking through a time warp and you're plopped down in 1965 or something. I expected Sammy Davis to be playing craps or Dean Martin walking around with an iced drink and a dame on each arm.

The showroom to see Charo is upstairs and there is a short escalator ride up there. The showroom is small and has plenty of zebra striped booths to get comfy in to watch the show in style.

There are plenty of tables and chairs too. I think they would have a hard time seating 200 people in there; it is a fairly small showroom. All the more cozy!

Arts & Entertainment,"This review goes back awhile as Charo is no longer performing at the Riviera Hotel and casino. However the memories in my head of this awesome show still flicker and I owe it to Charo to submit my review!

I was fortunate to be able to sit in the front row up close and personal, I wore my hair EXACTLY like hers that night and she referenced me to the entire audience stating I am her daughter! lol 

She sang to me and danced with me, yes I have the pictures to prove it! I was not the only special person in the crowd as she came down off stage and gave everything some lovin, just me more than others of course :) lol. 

She has still got it after all of these years! I was exhausted just watching her in action on stage! 

She even performed the famous ""Bandera"" or is it ""Bandero"". Anyhow we were very very very fortunate to have caught this performance.

I will see Charo any chance I get.

She is an awesome performer even if you are not a fan, you will have fun and really like this show! TRUST THIS!

She has a two day run over at South Point hotel and casino coming up 8/20 & 8/21. I will hopefully see that performance. I need me a Charo fix.

Yes I am young and was not even born when she was in her prime however I have adored her since I was a kid from tv. She rocks and I love her!

I attached pictures I took from my show that I took! Enjoy!",4
Local Flavor,"Are you just as tired as me?  Tired of walking through the Capitol Square Farmer's Market traffic jam of baby strollers, wagons, kids on leashes, and the ""samplers"" (def. one who stops at every booth offerring a sample and never buys anything)?  Or perhaps you're tired because you wake up at 6am to try and hit the Cap Square market before the hoards?

Then maybe the westside community market is for you.  We're talking basically the same selection of meats, produce and cheese.  Plus you're going to find Blue Marble dairy (!) and Sugar River Farms yogurt (!).  Also, you'll bask in the wide open promenade, and enjoy beaucoup de free parking (!).  Plus, if you park by the post office you find yourself right in between TWO markets.  That's right, the Hilldale farms market is just down the step in the Macy's parking lot.  

So, if you want to get your beauty sleep, your beautiful bounty, all without the headache of Cap Square, hit up the Westside Market and chiiiiilllll.",5
Local Flavor,"I am a big fan of the Dane county Farmers Market.  What I am not a fan of are dumbasses with their strollers who stop and stand like deer in headlights for 45 seconds, and then start walking again, so you don't even have enough time to get around them.  Then they repeat this about 30 times as you walk around the square.  I'm also not a fan of people who are standing in your way because they are trying to get a sample from a vendor, and then don't buy anything. 

Enter the Westside Community Market.  This smaller scale farmer's market has basically everything you'd want from the larger market without the hassle.  Sure you're not going to find hot spicy cheese bread, but who cares?  That stuff is over rated.  Come to the Westside market for Blue Marble Dairy where you can buy fresh milk (!!!) Honey Bee Bakery where you can buy little mini quiches to take home and for all the same staple vendors from the larger market.  With less crowds, and ample free parking. :D",5
Local Flavor,"This is my go-to market.  When guests are in town I bring them to the Downtown Market on Saturdays, but personally I can't stand the crowds and double-wide strollers and super slow pace.  I just want to buy local produce without alot of hassle and get on with my Saturday morning.

The Westside Market has a few dozen vendors selling all kinds of veggies, fruits, meats, plants, baked good, chocolates, dairy products, etc.  The vendors are friendly and knowledgable.

Be  sure to sign up for their weekly newsletter.  It's really great, with recipes and anecdotes and market updates.",5
Local Flavor,"This market is somewhat of a hidden gem. A lot of people drive right by it on University Ave without noticing it or knowing what an awesome market this is. Sure, the Dane County Market is fantastic for taking out-of-town visitors. But if you just have 15-20 minutes to spare, you cannot even get in and out of the parking ramp downtown. 

In that case, you need to check out this market. The quality of vendors is VERY good and the convenience factor is better than any supermarket. My wife sometimes comes here just for one item--in and out in 5 minutes. Let's face it, the downtown market is so big, it has a lot of redundancy, and dozens of veggie vendors.  How many tables of carrots do you need to walk by to find the perfect carrot? This market has enough of everything to find exactly what you are looking for, without the time commitment or hassle of the downtown market.",5
Local Flavor,"I went to this little farmer's market to avoid the hordes that have converged on the Capitol and State Street for Maxwell Street Days.  This is WAY more my speed.  I don't have to trip over fifty people and get assaulted by a stroller to get that lovely bunch of Thai basil I was looking for.  I also scored French green beans, red onions, and some gorgeous zucchini and summer squash.  Can't wait for dinner!",5
Local Flavor,"Just found out about this farmers' market this summer and it is awesome. Now if I have a hankering for local veggies/plants/fruits/baked goods on a weekend, this is my spot to go. Tons of parking and a good selection. This is so much easier than wandering around the crowded Dane County Farmers' Market.",4
Local Flavor,"The Westside Community Market is a great alternative to the Dane County Farmers Market.  It has a smaller number of vendors but the quality is excellent.  I was very pleased with the Door County cherries that I picked up today.  The less crowded atmosphere allowed you more time to browse and select the best quality produce without feeling rushed.  There are some vendors that have spots at Dane County, like Stella's and Madison Sourdough, but you get some smaller local vendors as well.  

Parking is easily available on the lot or on the street and you don't have pay for it, always a plus.  The atmosphere is a leisurely and laid back one where you don't feel the pressure to make hurried decisions because of the crowds pressing around you.",4
Local Flavor,"This is close to where I live, and with far fewer people. It's much smaller than the Capitol Square farmer's market, but it still has a fair selection of vegetables, pastries, and curds. Plus, lots of free, easy access parking, and WIDE aisles for traveling from stall to stall. It's a far less stressful experience. 

I came here this past Saturday for the first time and picked up some beautiful long beans and 2 for 1 scones. Also, Mad Maiden Shrub has a booth here on Saturdays so you get to sample some delicious locally made shrub and chat with the owner. Sign up for their mailing list and you're entered into a drawing for $5 to spend on your next visit.",4

Good heavens, if you want to gamble, go to a casino where you can at least get some comps and they attempt to filter the air.

Arts & Entertainment,"I know some of our wedding guests were talking about yelping our band, so I'm jumping on now to make sure I get the FTR (First to Review)...

I allowed Jared (my husband and yes I still love saying that), to choose this band for our wedding.  While we attempted to go hear them play once at the Blue Martini, it turned out to be an off night, so we missed them.  But I trusted him and I'm sure glad I did... They were incredible!

This band had the dance floor packed from the minute the ballroom doors opened until they packed up to leave... they played a wide range of music from Stevie Wonder to AC/DC to Black Eyed Peas and a ton in between.  They also chimed in when appropriate during my Dad's FOB (Father of the Bride) speech... they were on it!

We couldn't be more pleased with The Instant Classics' performance at our wedding... our only complaint was that the night had to end!

If you're looking for a band for a special occasion, give them a call... (and tell them Gabi and Jared sent you). Or if you want to go see them perform, I know they have a few regular gigs around the Valley - go check them out.  We are forever fans and look forward to seeing them again real soon!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Darn! FTRs (first to reviews) on Yelp are hard to come by these days and it looks like Gabi M beat me to it on this one! Oh well, I""ll let it slide...since she was the bride and all. ;)

As a professional wedding guest (seriously, this weekend makes 3 weddings just this month) I've learned that the most important part of the wedding is the bride and groom- duh.  And the 2nd most important part- the band!  If the band sucks...the music sucks...the dancing sucks.. the party sucks...and so on. 

Fortunately, for Gabi M's wedding guests The Instant Classics certainly did NOT suck.  I've seen very few wedding bands pull off both old and new music well, but The Instant Classics was able to pull it off perfectly. Therefore the music was awesome...the dancing was awesome...and the party was awesome!

If you're getting married in Phoenix you can't go wrong with these guys. Just make sure you get a big dance floor-  you're going to need it!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Wow.  Amazing.  Simply amazing.  When you see a live band, normally there might be one or two weak links... perhaps the drummer is just average, or maybe the guitar player is a bit mushy... not so this band.  The drummer, Nick can play the skins; the keyboardist, Johnathan, is masterful; the Bass player, Todd, is one of the best I've seen; and there are simply not enough superlatives to describe the lead guitar, Brian.  Which leaves the two front ""men"", Caleb and Christine.  

This group covers every genre, from Lady Gaga to Neil Diamond, AC/DC to Prince, and they do it flawlessly.  My wife and I sat there and were simply amazed at their quality.  Easily the best live band we've ever seen at a club.  I highly recommend them.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"This band truly rocks!  That Caleb is one damn sexy singer.....if you get a chance to see them, jump on it.  You will not regret your decision.  Unless your decision is not to see them.  Then, you might regret it.  Seriously.  Out.....",5
Arts & Entertainment,"this review is loooong overdue.  TIC played at our wedding back in October '11, and absolutely rocked the house.  From classic '80's to modern day hits like Lady Gaga, they will make your big day unforgettable.  my friends and family kept saying throughout the night that this was most fun they have ever had a wedding.  keep the booze flowing, the speakers turned up, and you'll go out in style!!  no one wanted to leave!  working w the band was great too.  they knew exactly how to MC the night and kept the energy high.  professional and courteous from our first meeting to the actual big day.  everyone will forget the food and flower arrangements, but a band like the instant classics will be memory soon not forgotten.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"When you're planning a wedding party, there are so many different elements you need to make it a success.  To us, one of the most important was the music.  We planned our ""kid's"" wedding sort of like a committee.  There were the bride and the groom, her parents, and us.  After that there were approximately 160 people in attendance who are mostly quite opinionated.  This Saturday evening party followed the wedding ceremony and a cocktail hour.
Our goal was simple.  We wanted everyone to eat, drink, dance and have a wonderful evening that they would remember.  Sometimes, I hate to say it, weddings can be rather stiff and boring.  This was not going to be the case with The Instant Classics.  In our planning phase, there was serous discussion as to whether we should have a live band or a DJ or both.  Our wedding planner made plans to expose us to both at various weddings and parties she was doing.  In terms of the live band, we had a number of very good choices.  We were able to watch videos of their performances, many had websites, and then go watch them play live.
When we first saw The Instant Classics, I was already leaning toward a live band with maybe a DJ to fill in at band breaks.  When we heard he Instant Classics, I knew immediately that they were my choice to help make our wedding party great.  My only concern was whether or not they would be available for our event.  Fate had it that they were.  They were also willing to meet privately with the bride and groom at some time before the wedding to talk about what they wanted from the band.  That meeting was a huge success.
The Instant Classics play a lot of different types of music under the category that I call Rock and Roll.  They have an extensive song list that is forever changing to keep current but still retain great music from the past.  Some of the genres we chose were Mellow, Oldies, Classic Rock, Big Rock, Funk-Disco, Dance-Hip Hop, and 90's-00's Rock.
Our collective families, although now happily living in the Phoenix area, came from Detroit.  So everything Motown is large to us.  As soon as all guests came into the ballroom, the band started playing.  No sitting on our hands.  They were beyond our expectations.  The dancing started immediately and went late into the night.  Nobody had to be asked to get up from their chairs.  Even people who I know never dance were on the dance floor all night long.  That is a huge credit to The Instant Classics.  They were very warm with our guests and immediately showed that on stage via their performance and you can feel it.  It was almost like a concert and dance at the same time because they were so amazing.  We ended up not using a DJ.  Our kids who were kind of reluctant to have a live band ended up having the best time.  The thing is if you're a live band, you have to be good.  The Instant Classics are way more than good.  They're great!
I would highly recommend them to everyone.  They certainly ""bring it"" and if your guests ""bring it"" as well, you will have the perfect evening.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I saw these guys at a corporate event and they're FANTASTIC. They transition from 50's to 60's to 70's to 80's so seamlessly that you'd imagine that they can play anything.... Then they started with the live karaoke. What an awesome way to do karaoke, with a great band backing you up. A+.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"This is really meant for the superfan, or someone whos never used deductive reasoning before. Good for teens and adults really into the show. A a casual CSI watcher, it was interesting, but lacking in a challenge for someone remotely interested in the sciences. Slight spoiler alert!


Felt like most of the facts were given, and not a challenge to figure out. The accompanying videos were interesting, but wasn't taken away by them. You get a diploma that you can choose to have emailed to you, or you can pay for a physical. Other then that you come away with nothing but the sheet of paper you filled out.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"They first review describes it well.  However, it is not challenging I felt - there could have been a much more intensive and interesting experience.  It gives a good overview of a lot of techniques, and has a good entertainment + information kind of value.  

-  Not worth 30 bucks when compared to a lot of LV shows.
-  Takes only 1 hour - fairly unique.
-  I would recommend doing it in groups.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"$26 online!  Hubby and I love the CSI shows (not including Miami) and we were excited to see what this was all about.  

In short, there are three different crime scenes to chose from.  Totally self-paced, you check out your scene - gathering as much info as you can.  Then you go through a large ""lab"" area for analysis.  There's even an autopsy area.   It's all very nicely done - with helpful information readily available to move you along.  

They try to make this enjoyable for everyone, so you will be able to solve the case with or without too much help.  What made it fun is that all the cast members from the show are involved - via videos.

If you're a fan of the show, you'll like this.  To me, the $26 was worth it.",4
Arts & Entertainment,zzZZzzz thats all I have to say.,3
Arts & Entertainment,"Not a massive fan of the show so if you are then i am sure you will rate it higher. Disappointed you can only solve 1 case, it is really easy to solve and make sure you do the stations in order. we were waiting for one station when the girl who worked there pointed to another station further down, bad idea as it answered half of the answers including who owned the gun and pretty much solved it for us. The girl who let us in at the main desk was HOT HOT HOT!!!. Defo the hottest girl in vegas,worth it just for her :-))",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I followed the sign that said to buy tickets downstairs, but was then sent back up, since I was using a credit card. The crime scene was kinda neat, although the body was laughingly cheap. The rest of the investigation was a total confusing mess and kept getting worse. Each part of the investigation had its own area, but all 3 crimes were crammed into one space. There was only space for two or three people at each station, but there were always at least 6 people just standing around in the cramped area waiting for their turn. There were no directions and the investigation sheet they give you was very poorly laid out. I was really looking forward to the show, but it took less than 5 minutes to be frustrated enough to look for the exit. My wife wanted to continue, so we waited forever for a few stations. We were finally forced to ignore the last two stations and went to file our investigation report. Unfortunately, neither of our 'Agent Codes' worked on the computer, so we couldn't submit our report. I'm have an MS in computers, so it wasn't user error.
They could have ACCIDENTALLY done this better. If they had thrown a bunch of equipment in the corner and pointed to it, it would have been more informative and entertaining.
Luckily, we were able to convince a couple of ladies not to waste their time and money, so that's a small compensation.
Avoid this exhibit. I've seriously never been so disappointed.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I'll admit I'm a fan of the show even though a lot of it isn't filmed here in Las Vegas, but eh.. 
So you get to the bottom of the stairs and pick a case file. I picked number two about the run down actress. Before I go any further my boyfriend who went with me, is rather analytical. 
You check out the scene and describe what you see. I was done in ten.. him 20...
Then you process everything in the lab.. me 15 mins
him 30 mins. 
Without giving anything away I will say it was cool to see how things are processed and they explain some science sounding advice.. :)
then in the end you report to MR. Grissom. and hell you can get a diploma saying you completed the case. 
Cheesy.. yes
Better when drunk... probably.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Our whole family are die hard CSI fans, so we wanted to see this exhibit. Quick Summary: I would compare this to a small section of a science museum. Interesting that you get to learn a bit about forensic science, but insulting that they assume you have the intelligence of a gnat or a 1st grader and don't let you decide how much information you want to be spoon fed. It is also WAY too short. You can be done with the exhibit in 30 minutes. It would be a bit cooler if they would let you solve the other 2 cases as well, so then you could stretch it to an hour. Why they don't give you access to the other cases is a mystery...

When you get there you have to choose which crime scene you want to solve (3 options), then they give you a piece of paper to write notes on (we all chose number 3 because we read that it was more difficult than 1 and 2). You start off with reviewing the crime scene and jotting down what you see. We took this seriously, which was kind of embarrassing because when you get to the first station in the lab it lists everything in the crime scene so that you can check your work. After this station you go off to the different labs to ""analyze"" your evidence. Again this is a funny concept as they have already done all the work for you; you are there evidently as a stenographer to record the obvious details that they spell out for you. At the end of this section you proceed into the autopsy room to learn how your victim died, then you enter all of your ""findings"" (again funny as they have presented all of them to you on a platter) to solve the case. At the end you can pay 5$ to get a copy of the CSI agent certificate. Needless to say we all passed on this, although my kids tell me that they received emails with the certificate attached without asking. Note to self: check credit card bill for extra charges. 

A sort of light at the end of the tunnel was that we didn't pay full price. We read online about the pick from 3 of the attractions and pay
only $54: http://www.nynyhotelcasino.com/entertainment/entertainment_3for54.aspx . This averages out to $18 a ticket. Our other events were the Bodies Exhibit (AMAZING- would pay full price for this), and the Shark Reef, also VERY good. I would skip this particular event and see the Titanic or ride a roller coaster if we had to do it over again. I would have been really upset if we had paid full price for this.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I've never seen the show but I'm sure if I had, I'd still have hated this. $30 is way too much money for this. You couldve not gathered evidence for your crime scene and still solved it. I understand it's supposed to be fun and easy but it should be a little challenging. Plus they wouldn't honor the coupon that we'd brought. Not realizing that the coupon had expired at the end of April, the concierge wouldn't cut us a break. The whole experience was an epic fail. Spend your money on Titanic or Body Works.",1
Arts & Entertainment,We went to go and check it out at the MGM because we are CSI fans!  I would say it is more for kids rather than adults!,1
Arts & Entertainment,"Not worth the money. Fortunately, I had good company and I got free tickets so I did feel better about not wasting money or time.

It was easy to do and I did not feel challenged in any way.

I don't even want to talk to it. Trust me. Don't do it.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Ok, if you are going to elect to do this, you have to go in with an open mind and view this as pure entertainment.  I guess my husband and I had too high of expectations.  We really thought we had to crack a serious case or something.  

We paid $30/ each person to do this. While there are 3 cases, the $30 only allows you to pick ONE out of the 3.  If you want to solve the next one, it's another $15, the last one is $10.  Anyway, we picked a case where an actress is found dead with tire tracks on her dress and then saw a small video clip about the experience.  

Ok, before I go any further, keep in mind that this experience is set up so that kids can solve the cases as well.  We walked in thinking we were really crime scene investigators sent to solve a really hard case. :)

After the video, we went to the crime scene where we're supposed look for clues.  We had a pen and paper and my husband and I spent a good amount of time trying to jot down ANYTHING and EVERYTHING that we saw.  We then went to another area where clues from another or the other 2 cases are posted on the walls and you have to look for the color-coding to figure out it's your case.  There's about 5-6 sections to go through to gather clues from forensics to chemical analysis, fingerprinting, analysis of tire tracks to xrays of the rib cage.  Then you're suppose to logon a computer and click on the correct answers and guess who the murderer is. 

It was a fun experience but in all honesty we really thought it would be a more challenging case.  The murderer was pretty easy to figure out and we felt like geeks for overanalyzing every little thing.  Regardless, it was fun to experience this.  Hey, $30 for an hour of entertainment sure beats losing the money in 5 minutes on the slot machine.  :)",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Are you kidding me? I must have not looked into this experience well enough opbviously! The experience was a load of crap, not challenging at all, it sucked....30, well 15 for each of us with the MGM card for what? You get all the answers toward the end anyways when you examine the body, the only thing challenging is to compare bullets and that was about it but on a scale of 1 to 10 it was 3 on challenge. Don't waste your time and money on this if you expect an experience. I expected too much like mixing with test tubes and looking at actual things that looked like blood or somewhat real, I didn't expect to sign up for a dead body in the desert and look at a small stage with a dead guy's wedding ring that wasn;t even gold, but looked like a metal, brass plated washer tool....so heavily disappointed and my dad just was in a hurry to get out of there....and certficates you ahve to pay for? This is a joke. Makes CSI unalluring, if I may use that word, which I may cause I already did.",1
Arts & Entertainment,My husband and I got two tickets for the price of one and I would still say it is not worth the money. Not much of an experience if you ask me.,1
Arts & Entertainment,"A 5 year old could do this.  They had a mock up of a crime scene and then you look at the ""lab"" that consisted of basically a picture match of things that any kid could do.  The mock up even had flaws in it and there really are no clues or anything to figure out.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Don't waste your money... luckily we got a heavy discount.

If you think of it as an interactive CSI Museum where you can learn how to collect evidence and think like a CSI then this might be for you.  But if you were thinking you would have to use your brain cells to solve a crime, you will be disappointed.  When you watch the interactive terminals, the CSI's actually spoon feed the info to you.  It seems like they just want the line to move as quickly as possible so people aren't waiting around for you.  What they could've done was create three different skill level scenarios.   This way people know what they're getting into.  Maybe pay more for the more difficult elaborate case.  

Oh well,  You can always play the CSI games on the computer.  Those are way more fun.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"DO NOT GO!!! I love CSI but this little tour is just...to put it bluntly...stupid. There are other places that will garner more delight such as losing money to the slot machine than to this god awful tour. You are not solving a crime...they practically provide you the answer when you are done with the tour. It is so lame...go take your money and ride a cab around the strip one time but don't get suckered into this....thing.

good for kids? yes...even a 2 year old can solve these crimes. If you are over the age of 8 you will be bored to death!",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Please mail me your $30 and I'll send you more interesting CSI material than this exhibit.  

Or better yet, just watch the tv show for free

My girlfriend was a huge CSI fan so she enjoyed it.  But my CSI experience is near zero and that's how I felt after it was all over.  

Kids will enjoy this exhibit if they are smart and like to pay attention.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Being a CSI Las Vegas fan, I knew I had to check this exhibit out my last trip to Sin City. 

You have the option to choose between three ""crimes"". I definitely wanted something gritty and risque that would be reminiscent of an episode but was disappointed by the lame and fluffy crime scenarios presented to us. There were several stations where you can view the crime scene, photos, ""pretend"" to do handle DNA samples, examine toxicology reports to identify fentenyl in the victims system, look at an unrealistic dummy on the autopsy table as a video explains the victims cause of death...blah, blah, blah...lame...lame...and lame.

I really wanted to love this experience but found it utterly painful and almost childish. The CSI crew sets you loose in a room to flutter about the stations. The experience would've been much more memorable with more hands on activities, better and more realistic visuals and a bit more interaction from the crew . I won't be coming back, nor would I really recommend this to anyone with half a brain.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"If you have teenager or pre-teen into mysteries, science or crime programs, then this is your stop.  A bit dull and simplistic for the adult audience, but would be fun with kids.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I really wish I would have read the yelp reviews before going here. The ""experience"" is boring and the puzzles are easy. You don't really have to do any problem solving, since they basically give you the answers. The facility is cheaply constructed, run down and not well maintained for costing $30.  It was a huge mistake and a waste of time and money.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"If you're a fan of the show this is a fun interactive hour. Glad I got my tix from goldstar.com though, the original price is a little steep for what you get. 
You get to play investigator and choose from three different cases. Solve the crime by collecting evidence and screening it in the lab. We all had a good time. But again if you're not a big fan, skip it.",3
Arts & Entertainment,I am a fan of CSI so I had a blast doing something other than clubbing or gambling. IMO not worth the full price but we purchased tickets on goldstar so it was cheaper.  You get 3 cases to choose from and then you solve them.  Yes the crime scene can look a little more real but kids are to do it to so I guess you dont want it to be too graphic. The attraction can take about 45min to an hour depending how fast you can solve it if you take your time. It was defin fun for our family to do it together.,4
Arts & Entertainment,"I am a huge fan of all things CSI, so it was a given that while my hubby & I were in Las Vegas we would check out CSI:The Experience....even better was the ""Father's Day"" deal....free for fathers, so after paying our $25 we headed down the escalator to begin the experience. 

It was such a let down.....I actually wanted my money back afterwords. 

It was completely self-guided, the crime was super easy to solve, we were almost spoofed the answer. The layout of the the lab area was not clearly marked, too many people were trying to use the same information/equiptment at the same time....not entertaining at all. The CSI:The Experience was a good idea....but it was very poorly executed......We wasted our time & money......don't waste yours.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"If you were a huge fan of the show then you will love this. If you just know of the show then maybe not so much. My mother is a HUGE fan of the show and got a kick out of it. I watched the show once or twice and thought it was meh. 

We went on the last tour of the day and the employees were basically shutting down the exhibit directly behind us like stalking us. Talk about not feeling rushed. I did it only cause my mom wanted to go and would only go again because she wanted to go.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Do not waste your money. If I could give them a negative star I would. We got some passes for dirt cheap and decided to give it shot. It was not fun, some of their so called lab equipment was not working and at the end after you solve the crime they want you to pay for your certificate. You can also pick to get it email for free...umm I picked email but people who pay full price of 30 bucks and they still have to pay for a freakin certificate! Please stay away I promise you will be disappointmented.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"You can't go more than once.   Was kinda fun, probably better if you had small kids with you?",2
Arts & Entertainment,"C'mon. This is MGM... one of the best casino/hotels in Vegas. And they house this? MGM should be ashamed. Granted, I could see this at the Excalibur or Luxor (and that isn't a dig; I love staying at the Excalibur), but the quality doesn't match MGM. It is way overpriced. There are coupons that shave a couple bucks off of it, or you can go with a package deal. Either way, CSI isn't worth it. It takes about 10 minutes to go through. You have these sheets on clip boards, and you go through ""evidence stations"" that are crowded with other people. These ""stations"" are like tiny puzzles that any moron with even a second-grader's logic could figure out. This might be good if you have 6-12 year-olds that happen to like the TV show, but this is not an attraction for adults or older teens.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I'm a huge fan of CSI- Las Vegas, so when our friends suggested going to this I was super excited to check it out with them. I thought it was very fun going through the different stages of looking for forensics evident. I think this is a very kid friendly excursion. I wouldn't go back again, but it was worth checking out. 
You get to pick one case to follow through on and there are 3 cases to choose from. Once you pick a case you get a piece of paper to write down everything. There are several stages of investigation and in the stages there are different labs, you have to find the ones that relate to your case. Then in the end you get to find out if you were right or wrong and you can print a certificate to say you got the case right! :)
Overall I thought it was too easy, but it was still interesting. 

Tip: Don't over think it!",3
Arts & Entertainment,Have a few drinks and / or bring kids before going.,2
Arts & Entertainment,"The CSI franchise is ruined by this attraction. It's seriously something designed with children in mind, but I would venture to say that kids would even find this very boring. Basically all the interaction is done for you and you just walk through a few rooms parroting back what the TV says. It is seriously a waste of time and money. 

Stay FAR FAR away from this place and don't get suckered in by the ticket package (don't pick adventuredome either since Circus Circus is far and out of the way).",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Waste of time!  When I entered and saw the crime scenes I was like ""Okay, this is gonna be cool"".  As soon as I solved the first puzzle in the lab I realized this is less about being an investigator and more about catering towards the family experience. The puzzles are very basic, which a ten year old could appeal to.  So, if you are a family man, then by all means take your kids.  If you are everyone else, just stay far, far away from this pathetic joke for a forensic experience.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Okay, this place was not that bad. It was fun if you didn't expect a lot out of it. It's a family fun thing to do with the kids and people who are fans of the show. I was plenty excited when I passed by it and bought tickets for it (Tix 4 you has cheaper tickets right our the hotel). I'm a huge fan and has watched this since it came out so I really got a kick out this, I was literally jumping right before they sent us off on our 'case'. LOL.

They had three cases, and they randomly assign you one and they send you off to your crime scene, the lab, toxicology, ME, etc. You have a sheet of paper in hand that you have to fill out with evidence and stuff that you find along the way before gathering all of it and deducing who done it and such. It wasn't exactly hard, and I had actually expected something more difficult- but oh well. Some things didn't really make sense to me and a lot of the answers were already provided, but overall a fun experience that fans should come and try out. If you solve the case, you get a diploma sent to you via email or you can get it printed there for $6.95 (hella expensive... But it's on nice paper, LOL) At the time that we did it, they were giving out free hats/beanies to those that solved the case, so we were awarded a nice black CSI hat. :D",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Hmm, I'm usually the cranky one in my ratings, and I can sometimes be a little nitpicky/detailed... But in the case of CSI museum, my rating is higher than most. I had a decent time. They have 3 scenes to choose from, and one of them is superior to the others (the one with the car crash). Better clues and more interesting investigating with this one. True, it's not hard to solve, and it's probably more fun for kids. But if you're willing to be a kid for an hour or so, it's interesting enough.  Keep your expectations low. And don't pay half price to do a second scene. The car crash scene is the only interesting one. Oh, and don't pay full price.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"My foreign exchange student from Germany, wife and I went through this exhibit yesterday.  They must have fixed it up and improved it since some of the reviewers went through.  I saw none of the problems they report.  Everything worked fine.  We did the 'A House Collided' case.  I thought the crime scene and lab stations were set up very well.  

The best part was looking over the crime scene and trying to make note of everything interesting on my form.  Reminds me of those games in which you look at a picture and then try to spot the differences or to later draw or describe what you saw.  I didn't expect to actually get to touch much of anything in the exhibit given that they have to keep it intact for dozens of people to interact with daily.  They almost fooled me with the surprise ending to the case, but we figured it out. It was fun for Max, my wife and I to come up with our own ideas about what happened and to compare notes. We each noticed things that the others missed.  

I liked the ability to leave a video note on what I saw in the exhibit. Now my little video is part of the Experience :) The diploma that you can get either at the exhibit or have emailed to you was a nice touch too.  Max is the fan of the show in our group. I've only seen a few episodes, but both he and I thought they did a good job of capturing the feel of the show.  If you are a big-time fan of the show, you can even get your picture taken in Gil Grissom's office.  

This experience isn't quite as lavish as the sadly missed Star Trek Experience the Hilton made the mistake of removing, but it is a fun diversion.  

A Pro Tip: Go to the CBS Television City booth first and get free tickets to that. Watch a TV show and rate it for them. Then they will give you Discounts on CSI The Experience as well as for food and drinks around the MGM. You also get a discount at the souvenir shop if you go to the CSI The Experience first, before you shop.  If you are a local, there is a discount for that as well.  If you get anything in the Experience Shop, get the syringe pens or the highlighters that look like high tech sample cases. Those are cool.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I simply went to make my partner happy... but I had an open mind, and I love mysteries.. so I thought it could be pretty fun.. 

Yikes. 

It was a massive waste of money. 

We were GIVEN a case.. the lamest one there.. and then had to ""solve"" the murder.  And by solve, I mean given the answers at each station until you get to the end, where you ""solve"" the case-- and if you couldn't solve it, you are a box of rocks. 

Maybe if I were with a 10-13 year old kid? 

The people that I was with acted like they enjoyed it... but I think they were faking it.",1
Arts & Entertainment,Sadly it was really boring. And way to easy! I wanted to feel like I really figured out who did it!,2
Arts & Entertainment,"Unless you have children ages 12 and under, do not go here. Waste of time and money if you're over 21. If it were more challenging I would have liked it more. The setup is okay and it's cool to see the different angles a death can be looked at. Informative, but this is a Disneyland attraction. Something just not for Vegas. 

Also it's a total rip-off in the end because you don't event get a ""certificate"" printed out for you unless you pay for one. Don't fall for this tourist trap even if you are a true CSI fan. You will be disappointed.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"It was mildly interesting, but way way overpriced.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"It was cool to do once, a tad pricey...but this is Vegas :)",4
Arts & Entertainment,"It was cute and educational, but they should make it more complicated for adults. I think it's perfect for children under 14. It is overpriced, so I am glad that my friend was able to get us discounted tickets. And, they have the nerve to not print out the certificate for you in the end. They want you to pay extra money for a fake paper certificate? Where they do that at? They could at least give the certificate free and then try to sell the frame for it.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"This deserves 0 stars. I love CSI and have watched it since the beginning. This attraction was lame from start to finish. If I was 7 and had never play a video game, I might be challenged and think this was great. If that doesn't describe you then you will be disappointed in the way they give you all the clues and answers. All you have to food walk stood and touch computer screen ""next"" buttons. If you want a great, great, GREAT CSI like experience, check out ""Mystery Adventures"". That company has a bus they take you to multiple locations, you have to find clues, figure out puzzles and actually do some work to solve the case! Way better the the CSI thing at MGM.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"It is OK. I am not a big CSI fanatic, so I didn't have very lofty expectations. 

The initial set up was cool where you mapped out the crime scene, but it doesn't seem they are taking care in these sets. There was random trash from customers littered around, which wasn't part of the crime scene. The puzzles which followed were somewhat interesting, but not very challenging. The autopsy part was pretty cool. The workers for the experience seemed very vanilla. You could tell they put in many endless days at this place, and they seemed to be rushing you through the part at end on computer.

This would probably be great for kids 8-14ish",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Decided with a few friends to go last minute. Wish we hadn't gone. The experience is very boring and not interesting at all. They give you a clip board to write your evidence on. You're suppose to investigate and be the forensic detective but they give you all the answers, you walk through the place but have to stop at a computer all the time to get more clues... It just wasnt a true csi experience. Not challenging at all.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Why, for the love of Pete, WHY did I not think to check Yelp about this attraction before I went?  I was in town three months ago for a conference, staying at MGM Grand, and walked by it 3 times a day thinking ""that sounds like fun, I should go"" but never got a chance to.  And, last week, when I brought my honey here for vacation, I had this on my 'must try list'.  After going to see Zumanity, they gave you a flier for 40% off CSI and the other Cirque de Soleil shows - so I thought, awesome, we can go see CSI for cheap!

Even at 40% off this was a massive ripoff.  They advertise it as if you will actually get to think and do detective work.  Nope.  You get to look at a poorly lit, roped off 'crime scene' where you can't really see anything - to look for clues - and that my friends is the extent of the detective work.  From there, you go into a room that shows pictures of all the clues you couldn't possibly see in the actual crime scene and then you fumble your way around through 'stations' that are from 3 different crime scenes to try to find the ones that apply to yours.  But when you find them, they just spoon feed you info about the case.  There is no thinking or 'solving puzzles' involved.  And, if, like us you end up accidentally visiting these stations in the wrong order (because they're not organized in any sort of orderly fashion) you are given SPOILERS about what you supposedly learned at other stations you never did even end up finding.

Then you go answer a 'quiz' on the computer about the evidence (which you can't possibly get wrong unless you don't actually speak English or didn't actually visit the stations that give you the answers flat out) and voila you are done.  

We were in there about 15 minutes, spent $20 per person, and felt like it was the biggest disappointment and waste of money of our trip.  It clearly caters to the lowest common denominator of stupid person and not to anyone who actually wants to solve a puzzle.

Shame on you, CSI and MGM Grand for hosting such crap!  And shame on me for not thinking to Yelp this waste of time first esp. since I spent hours Yelping all the restaurants we went to on our trip.  I don't give 1's very often but you deserve the cone of shame!",1
Arts & Entertainment,"This was really fun, but it seemed a bit too short. I enjoyed that just my friend and I got to work on a case by ourselves, but at times we had to wait for a station which kind of sucked, but since it wasn't very busy was usually only for a minute or two. I wished it had been a bit longer and maybe a little more interactive. For the price, I considered it worth it, but we had a $10 off coupon so maybe that helped my disappointment. Overall, it is a great concept and an interesting way to spend an hour out of the summer heat. I just wish it was executed a little better.",4
Arts & Entertainment,Thankfully I had a Groupon and didn't pay full price. Overall the experience lacked any kind of fun/ challenge. All the clues/answers were given to you and there was a complete lack of organization. Stations set up to allow to groups at once were occupied by one group using twice the space. The staff acknowledged that some stations weren't in proper working condition and explained how many times they have been told about it before. I wouldn't recommend this place for even kids. They would have a much better time for the money at another experience.,1
Arts & Entertainment,"After going through CSI: The Experience, and solving a murder myself, I don't see how the police every let a murderer go free? They are so easy to catch! You just look at the crime scene with the bag of drugs lying next to the dead body, and then check the victim's cell phone to see who sent her a text message saying ""let's meet up and do some drugs"" right before she died, then you use the little slidey fingerprint matching thingy to find out who's prints are on the bag of drugs (same girl who sent the text!) and push the little buttons to do the chemical tests to see what changes color to figure out what the drug was, and viola! You just solved yourself a crime! After going through this, the only reason I could see the cops not catching a murderer is pure laziness.

Seriously though, this is a pretty hokey ""Experience,"" and it totally oversimplifies police work, even by the standards of the television show CSI. We had coupons for $5 off entry (somebody handed them to us on the strip) and it was still $53 total for two people. We were in there for maybe 40 minutes, because we went through everything thoroughly and had fun making fun of the exhibits. I had a good time going through here honestly, but I cannot whole-heartdly recommend it to you, because you may not.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"YOU WILL BE VERY MAD AT YOURSELF FOR SPENDING ANY TIME OR MONEY HERE - I WAS!  My six friends and I went to Vegas for 5 days in Aug/Sept 2012.  There is a neat little ticket office outside of the CSI Experience where you can buy 3 events for 54.00 - we thought the CSI Experience would be cool. It turned out to be the laughable crappiest low point of the trip. 

IT WAS NOT

You're assigned a crime to solve, BUT AS WE DISCOVERED...there is nothing to solve or use your brain for whatsoever - they assume youre an idiot and basically tell you who did it almost in the most obvious way they can at every step.  This would be awesome (probably not) for a 4 yr old....if you're over 4 and don't wet the bed anymore - this assenine ""experience"" will leave you mad you spent any money on it at all.

I am personally vowing to ""review kill"" this craptastic un-attraction into the ground.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I've always been a CSI fan so I've wanted to try this out every time I've visited Vegas and I finally did.

Let's just say that I'm glad I didn't have to pay full price for my ticket & the bf's. The setup is nice but it could use more work.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I thought this was pretty fun. My fiance and I enjoyed working the case. Some of it wasn't very challenging, but it was something to do. Sign up for the M club!!! It's practically 2 for the price of 1 if you join. I would have liked to do the other two cases, but we were tired.",4
Arts & Entertainment,This attraction was a good way to kill an hour. My wife and I teamed up to solve the murder in scenario one. We followed the path and went through the steps in solving the case some of which seemed spoon feed to the CSI and not really sluethed out. I think some games of Clue have been more challenging. The overall experience was fun and informative but don't expect any surprises. If you go in thinking it is a puzzle game you will be disappointed. This is more of a science museum with active participation. The best part of the attraction was the cool vest and the souvenir photo.,2
Arts & Entertainment,"Overpriced and under-fun. This was more trouble than it was worth and the ""crime scenes"" were G-rated and boring. Probably OK for kids, but if you're over 12, skip it.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Killing time before we had a flight to catch, my husband and I spent our last few hours in Vegas exploring activities within the hotel we had stayed all week, the MGM Grand. 

The experience was fun! I have never seen one episode of CSI and maybe if I had, I wouldn't have felt like the ""experience"" was overpriced.

The good: getting assigned a ""case"" to solve and while it was easy, I did enjoy it. The ""eh"": For $25 (that was with a $5 off coupon) I wouldn't have gone had my husband not wanted to. To me the CSI experience should be something included in a trip to something else (like a hands on science museum with lots of hands on activities).

Not bad to kill time, but if you have other things planned, I wouldn't waste my time.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"tip:  there are coupons in those free vegas coupon books, make sure to use them if your interested in attending.  

super big fan of CSI so i was pretty excited to finally get to experience this.  unfortunately like most folks say my expectations fell way short.  before you start the employees give you some CSI paperwork that you will use later, and then you watch a 5 minute video of Grissom saying some general things about CSI and the crimes.  afterwards you have the option of choosing 3 crime scenarios, looking at the clues, and then with your csi paperwork, take notes and then return to the 'lab' to analyze the results.  even though your technically only allowed to do one case, you can always go back and do all three cases since your allowed in the area as long as you like.  

once you take all your notes, you head to the faux lab and go to station to station to analyze the results.  each station is unique (gun shot analyze, foot prints, etc)  and such but just didn't seem to exciting to me and to be honest figuring out what happen is pretty easy.  once your done, you get a certificate saying you solved the mystery.  

overall, pretty boring, some props they use are cool, but not sure if its worth 25 bucks.  for the big CSI fans, i think its worth checking out, but don't expect too much like me or else you will feel disappointed when its over.  the CSI brand is pretty strong, so maybe they can improve this experience somehow...",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Never saw a CSI episode, but thought it will be interesting. 
Staff wasn't nice (enough) to me. Till I understood what I should do with the given paper we were investigating a wrong scene.
So they were closing and I wanted to check other labs as well and asked if I can come back next day, first the girl there said that I can talk to the manager but when I was going to talk to the manager, she said that the other labs are for different crime-scenes and ""technically I shouldn't look at them"". So according to her, I had to walk around with my eyes closed and open only when it's related to my crime-scene.
Finding the location was a hard task itself. No signs in MGM about and got tired from asking directions and walking in there
But museum was fun, I've learnt some things, lots of info I guess, but it's very much overpriced and I've not gotten my ""certificate"" or whatever they should email me.",1
Arts & Entertainment,Definitely not worth $32.00! It was ok..but I would not recommend it. This attrach would be a deal @ $11.99,2
Arts & Entertainment,"In the morning we visit MGM Grand's ""CSI: The Experience"".  You may choose to solve one, two or three murders.  We opted for one since we were neophytes to this experience.  I am quickly reminded why Bella (the daughter of a scientist) has a decided advantage over me (lover of mystery novels) in a game where analyzing data and drawing conclusions is the name of the game. 

The first room features a tiny theater where we watch a brief intro taped by one of the CSI characters.  Then we enter the crime scene and everyone begins sketching their drawing of the crime scene and jotting down any evidence that may be important.  Next we visit the various labs and gather and review evidence.  At the conclusion you log-on to a computer and complete your final report.  It is analyzed in real time and you receive feedback from your supervisor.  Finally, you receive an official CSI diploma.  

My unfortunate reality is that ""science"" is my 2nd worst subject (math being the worst) so I'm a little surprised I had a good time and didn't completely ""screw the pooch"" (so-to-speak).  As mentioned earlier my love of mysteries plagued me a little as it  is my natural instinct to question as to whether witnesses are lying or not.  I forgot that there was tangible evidence and oftentimes scientific evidence supporting the statements made by the various suspects.  Bella thoroughly enjoyed herself and I enjoyed watching her constantly calculating brain in action.  We will definitely be back one day for Bella to solve murders number two and three.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"The while experience was ok. You get to play detective and look for clues and try to solve the case. I recommend NOT paying the regular $30 and somehow get a discount. I paid $15 on groupon. Not a place to go out of your way for but if you happen to be nearby or need to kill time, then this is your spot",4
Arts & Entertainment,"This was by far the BIGGEST waste of money and time I've ever spent in my entire life!!! Firstly the price was ridiculous! For two people the price is $53.45, secondly they say it takes an hour to complete and it's actually 15-30 depending on which crime scene you are assigned . And you get nothing in return but a stupid emailed diploma . Do not waste your money folks. You can thank me now",1
Arts & Entertainment,"The concept sounded really cool for me and my 12 year old son but I found this to be a complete disappointment. While we enjoyed solving the case it just seemed like it could have been so much better. The staff while nice seemed overwhelmed and understaffed. It seemed a lot of the equipment was on the blink not sure if we had bad timing or if this was a continuing problem.

Also, for what it is the price seemed a little high. The experience comes no where near the level of the TV show. Loved the concept but the execution failed miserably.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"USE COUPON!! I got my tickets at Tix4tonight outlet, it is about buy 1 get 1 free compare to the original listing price.

I am a super CSI fan so this is on my TO DO list in Vegas and I was really looking forward to it. 
The location is located all the way to the back in MGM, took the escalator down and the CSI staff will gave us the official vest and report sheet; which listed the case that you are assigned.

There were 3 crime scenes but  you can only go to the randomly assigned one, followed the report sheet to answered the questions, after the crime scenes, there were different labs: blood, bone and alcohol lab.

We did walked around and peek on other ""cases"" try to get the full experience. Then all of sudden, a group of 15+ people came in and the lab got really crowded.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience, it is not the best or most fun experience, but it was a CSI moment. We did not upgrade the diploma or take the $25 photo at Grissom's office cause it all seem pricey.  We took a photo at the main entrance and the staff was so nice and let us borrowed their vest for the photo.

I don't think this is a place for kids to explore the lab, a local Discovery Center might be cheaper and more educational. 

PS. enter a real email address at the Computer lab, so they can email you a FREE CSI diploma  :)",3
Arts & Entertainment,"If you are a fan of the CSI tv show, you should check it out.  I don't get why the low ratings from so many yelpers.  Hey, its Vegas. Its cheesy. Its supposed to be cheesy Vegas!  

Many places offer discount tickets. I got mine on Groupon (basically it was 50% off) or check your Vegas magazine in your hotel room for a coupon.  

You're a CSI person looking for clues.  The experience walks you through it, although it can be a bit confusing finding your station (there's 3 stations, and you're assigned to 1 of 3).  Unless you're a toddler (and they recommend a child over the age of 12 to attend) you can't really mess up.

I had a great experience.  I would not go back (there's no need if you solved the crime) but if you're a CSI Vegas fan, its a ""should"" check out event. Thumbs up.. I miss you, Grissom!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Um yeah a bit boring for adults and true CSI fans...blah really. It is an experience, just not a good one for the price...sorry wish it was better",1
Arts & Entertainment,"If you are experiencing Vegas with children ages 7-12 then this place is a must see!  It offered great insight into forensic science while still being very kitchy in its CSI (the TV show) theme.

However, as the adult playing tourist, I was not impressed. I love the show. I love the intricacies of forensic science but it lacked in follow through. I would have loved more in depth explinations on how they do things or more hand on opportunities to participate. For $30 a person, it needed a little something more.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"What's not to like about this crime scene investigation experience? I have always been a big fan for CSI like TV shows, such as CSI, Dexter, Fringe, Body of Proof, Bones... Finally I get to experience what it's like to be a forensic scientist for solving crimes, also the blood spatter analysis, DNA match, autopsy... It was really interesting and exciting! 

There are three crime cases, we were assigned to one of the crime scenes, we need to write down all the things we see, very detailed explanations, go through a few medical examinations to get clues, in order to catch the suspect. It was quite some work to finish the whole thing! 

We got most of the clues right, missed some, but we still got the right result, caught the right suspect! Yeah! Hubby and I were so happy catching the bad guy! 

I think this exhibit is great for people who are into forensic science, CSI like TV shows, or just simply like to solve puzzles! It is also a fun activity for couples, hubby and I partnered very well to solve the crime, it felt intimate in a different way, maybe just for me, I love medical examiner fall in love with cop scenario a little too much. ;p 

Ps. $32 per person, they offer $58 for 3 shows per person at MGM Grand casino hotel, they have a few good ones to choose from, it's better deal than just spend $32 for one exhibit here.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I used a groupon and I would have been disspointed if I paid full price but this was fun. Lots of little rooms you go from point a,b,c etc to solve the crime. I did Case #2, and the crime scene was pretty accurate looking (considering it was a dummy). There are employees walking around in lab coats, helping you out. It is better if you do it in a group BUT I would have rather done 2 different scenarios so we could have gotten a little different views on 2 different cases.",3
Arts & Entertainment,I loved it due to the fact im a big fan of CSI..I would suggest going to ebay to find tickets to save some money if you are on a budget but all and all I really liked it..from the details in the crime scene to the autopsy....very cool,4
Arts & Entertainment,"Absolutely worst experience in Vegas.  Half the computers were broken, props are old.  Cheesy exhibits.  For the amount of money we paid, even with our groupon deal, it was too much.  

Find it on groupon if you MUST go, and only pay $15 per ticket.  

Also, this is inside the MGM Grand Hotel, all the way in the back.  It is a seriously long walk from the front.  While you are there, if you must go, you might as well do the CBS Television Research Lab Center.  That is free.  That's the only way this would be worth the money.  Budget 45-60 minutes.  

The MGM Hotel smells like a bad brothel of nasty perfume.  It was gross.  The whole hotel.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"CSI: The Experience was one of the attractions on my Las Vegas Power Pass. I took some time out of my schedule to check out this attraction. There are selected times in which the attraction starts (check the start time schedule so you're not waiting). You're giving a CSI vest and note pad like a real investigator. You must figure out who committed the crime as you go through the experience. I thought the hands on part of the attraction made the experience. Staff takes your picture with different backgrounds at the end of the experience for purchase. Customers can purchase CSI Las Vegas merchandise at the store as well. I really enjoyed this attraction. If you like CSI (forensics) or hands on attractions, CSI: The Experience is a good choice.",4
Arts & Entertainment,We are huge CSI fans... This is a great concept but a bit cheesy. However my 14 year old loved it. Good time filler but therez better out there.,2
Arts & Entertainment,"SAVE YOUR MONEY HONEY!

For 3 people we spent $95 all to look at computer screens? Ok you start off with a crime scene and then you go from computer to computer to ""Solve the case."" which could have been a fun concept if it weren't for the fact that its programmed to solve it for you. OK fun right.

So basically all you do is go from one computer station to another click a mouse and boom that's your ""CSI Experience"" The kicker is you get a diploma afterwards which is an EXTRA $5.95 nope they couldn't include that piece of paper in the $95 they initially charged. 

RIP OFF

Me id rather watch paint dry.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"This exhibit ended up being just ok and a lot smaller and quicker to visit than I had imagined. I'm a big fan of the show and when a co-worker had a couple tickets to give away, I jumped at the opportunity! Tickets are normally about 30 bucks, which is quite a bit since you'll to through the entire thing and solve your crime in about 30-40 min. There are 3 scenarios and they will assign 1 to your group once you pay and check in to receive your assignments. Each participant gets a pen, clipboard and worksheet where you will jot down your notes and evidence just like a real CSI. Then off you go to watch a short 3 min video introduction and then a visit to the crime scene you were assigned. We were the red team or crime scene #3, which involves skeletal remains that were found in the desert.

After visiting your respective crime scene, you go into the lab, where there are stations located throughout corresponding to your specific crime scenes. Find each station and watch videos, read signs and work on computers to reveal answers to the questions on the worksheet to lead you to solving your crime. At the end you will report  your findings to your supervisor via computer to receive your diploma, which you have to pay $5.95 for or you can email it to yourself, which is what we did...really, who is going to pay $5.95 for a piece of paper printed in color ink? Felt like they nickel and dimed you for everything...admission, then diploma, and then photo. 

This final stage where you submit your report/findings is also where you will throw on CSI vests, hats and fake guns to take a green screen photo. There are various backgrounds that you can choose from and they have you take 3 different poses. Photos were $14.95 each and then $6.95 for each additional one after the first. We decided to buy a photo because we really liked one of the backgrounds.

Overall we had a good time but including taking photos, picking the one we liked and making the purchase, we were there less than an hour. Definitely not worth the full price they are charging, but it's worth a visit if you can get some kind of discounted ticket or coupon or something, especially if you're a fan of the show/series.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I had a great time completing the CSI Experience, and recommend it to anyone in Vegas needing an activity for kids.  A few years back I took my son and younger cousins to Vegas for his birthday, as a way to keep them entertained throughout the day I decided we would go over to MGM and take a twirl with CSI.  With my extensive detective skills watching Snapped and 1st 48 I just knew I was a shoe-in. 

The experience was very well planned and made this a collaborative group experience.  We solved the crime and somehow had a great family bonding moment.  The only con is, when we came there was a fight later that night....and uh, well MGM is GHETTO.  But I enjoyed myself nonetheless.

I got my tickets on Goldstar (a girl loves a deal)",3
Arts & Entertainment,"This wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. Perhaps it was more geared for children, but there was nothing adventurous about this experience.",2
Arts & Entertainment,I really enjoyed this. My husband said it was a bit dry for him. You do interact with computers to help you deduce your crime scene but I did not think that took away from the experience. I got bogo tickets from booking at vegas.com so it was not a huge financial deficit.  Don't go in expecting to be involved in an episode of CSI and you should enjoy the experience.,4
Arts & Entertainment,"#meh. There are three 'crimes' and you get selected to 'investigate' one of them. The one we did (number 3) had evidence missing from scene of crime and what appeared to be 'evidence' which was not detailed in the laboratories. 

Fun... Sure. We are big CSI fans and it was worth the groupon purchase and time spent (glad we didn't pay full price.) Would have preferred a challenge and would have paid more if it WAS challenging. 

Someone should check to ensure the crime scenes still have all props. Whole exhibit probably needs to be updated in general.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"It was a bit boring in my opinion. You get to investigate one of the 3 crime scenes. At the very beginning I was very pumped because I thought we actually get to solve a 'puzzle' but they actually give you the answers to the clues for each laboratories that you have to go through. It doesn't even require thinking because the answers are right in front of you.

Overall, it was worth the groupon purchase but not worth for the full price. It's good for experience. I think kids would enjoy this more than the adults.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Super boring, do not waste your time. All you do is walk around from station to station, they say it will take up to an hour, but no it can be done in 20 min. You're just waiting around for the people in front of you. We had more fun taking pictures of ourselves at the end then we did in the actual ""experience"" glad I didn't pay full price.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"With the CSI Experience, you get one of three crimes to solve. You view the crime scene then stop by different stations to view weaponry, trace evidence, forensic evidence, etc to solve a crime. It gives an interesting view on science and learning about how to analyze evidence (somewhat surface level, but something new will likely be learned).

However, there are two main difficulties I had that significantly curtailed the enjoyment:

1. Dim lighting. If you have difficulty reading in dim light or when on glossy boards, you may want to skip this attraction since the signage, evidence, and crime scene will be difficult to see.

2. Much of the experience felt very dated and the entire experience was housed within a fairly small area (square footage wise). 

It seems as though this would be really great for kids ages 7-12, or for those with a keen interest in forensic science. But it may not be worth the $28 ticket (or even $14-18 for discounted prices ) given the other options in Vegas",2
Arts & Entertainment,"There are 100,000 ways to waste money in Vegas.  This may be the least fulfilling. Yes, even worse than getting syphilis from that twice-divorced, 40-something ""I'm 48, I'm not dead"" MILF you met outside of the Flamingo.

CSI: The Experience has literally no redeeming value. We went in thinking we might see some displays that show, like, Luminol in action and stuff. No.

Rather, you are given a clipboard and walk from a staged ""crime scene"" to several ""forensic stations"" to solve the crime.

Fisher-Price toys require advanced skills compared to solving this ""crime.""

Even worse, key parts of the displays were not functioning. Like, say, the LED that is supposed to make the water of a ""drug test"" turn red.

As you reach the end, the staff asks if you'd like to dress up in CSI costumes and have your photo taken as you solve your case. Hell no. I want *no evidence* to document my presence.

Oh, there was a crime committed here. It happened at the cash register when they took my $24.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I went to Vegas and I also went on a Groupon maranthon!  I saw this at a great price so I took it. I use to LOVE CSI back in the day with the original cast (I dont watch it anymore for obvious reasons).  Again, I did not read any reviews or read what this is about.  I knew it was an ""experience"" type deal but I really thought it would have memorabilia from the show.

This was kinda a waste of money. Good thing it was super cheap otherwise if you paid the full price you would be screwed and angry. 

They give you a clip board and you have to solve the crime.  Now that would be cool if they had elaborate sets and it was ""longer""

Not really.  All 3 crimescenes basically led into one room and they gave you the answers as you were solving it.  The sets weren't really that great.  It was basically a computer screen which you read on. 

But honestly, nothing of any real substance.  The whole thing took like less then 15 mins. They really need to add more to it because it was too short.

Good thing it was super cheap. Otherwise don't go here and don't pay full price.",2
Arts & Entertainment,I did this CSI Experience today with my husband as an early birthday gift and for the 4th of July. This is not what I expected at all and I felt that we spent way too much money for this really dumb exhibit. I was so disappointed by this as it felt so childish and stupid. I cannot believe we wasted a Friday holiday on this or that we spent $60 on this event for the day. I could think of many other ways to spend $60 in Vegas without feeling lame. I wish we could get a refund from Vegas.com because this is the one time I would think a refund is warranted. This exhibit is such a joke and a waste of money do not bother trust me!!!,1
Arts & Entertainment,IF you are looking for something to waste a little time before a show or just a die hard CSI fan I say go for it. The case I did was pretty simple you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out. They also do military discounts!,3
Arts & Entertainment,Pretty boring and not very entertaining - 15 mins for the whole thing. Don't waste the money,1
Arts & Entertainment,"It was OK and a nice break to get out of the sun.  I was there for about 45 minutes.  Make sure to get a discount because I would say it was not worth full pricing.  That being said, I likely won't return to solve any of the other cases.  I wasn't disappointed, but wasn't overly excited about it either.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"To be completely honest, this was such a waste of time. It was short, boring and uneventful. 

First of all,  you are greeted by a gum smacking teenager who barely smiles and gives you a piece of paper with a clipboard that is suppose to be a map. Then you are divided into different groups (by color) and after that, you are pretty much on your own. So it's not like you are really ""solving"" anything. There are people are hovered around you (the people in your color group) that are doing the exact same thing you are doing so people are giving away all the answers when you just got there. 

Nothing looks real. NOTHING. I was soooooooo disappointed. At the end, you get to pose for pictures with some props (of course, there is a price) (this was my favorite part). And you get to make your own CSI certificate after you answer 5 questions or so. (and of course, again there's a price if you want it printed or free if you get it emailed to yourself). The whole so-called experience took less than 20 mins. What a joke! 

BTW, the room is super small and dark. Bad ventilation. Everybody in there was hot and calmy. Ewwwwwww!",1
Arts & Entertainment,If you like CSI you will like this place. It does hand hold you a little more than I would have liked but still it is an interesting and unique experience.,4
Arts & Entertainment,"Holy crap this was the biggest let down out of my entire Vegas vacation. 

I've always wanted to do this because I went to Vegas last year and ended up not having time to go.

On paper it looks amazing. Go in, analyze a crime scene and attempt to solve a crime. They have various sections inside so you can ""analyze the data you gathered""

Let me tell you this if you're planning on going ""DO NOT OVER THINK THINGS"" as matter of fact, DON'T THINK AT ALL. There's no analysis, there's no studying the crime scene, all answers are practically given to you... They just walk you through it. 

It's VERY pathetic. It was hilarious, me and a friend were actually thinking so deep into it, analyzing the crime scene carefully, jotting down everything we saw...and when we finally go to the end we just laughed at how pathetic it actually was. All the ""analysis"" is practically already laid out on the various sections, all you do is record them on the sheet you're given. 

Save your money.",1
Arts & Entertainment,I came here because I had purchased a groupon. It's really not worth the full price so try and get the groupon. I really thought they would set up crime scenes and we would have to investigate by putting things together. You literally just go on a computer and answer questions even a fifth grader could answer. I felt like all I did was match pictures together and voila! I solved the crime. Not worth it in my opinion.,1
Arts & Entertainment,"Worst customer service and most boring experience ever!
My hubby and I purchased the tickets from Vegas Baby app at a discounted price, but the confirmation emails were never sent to either one of us. My hubby called Vegas Baby and got our code for the tickets. The CSR @ Vegas Baby said we coukd simply go to CSI, give them the code, and ask them to call Vegas Baby to verify the purchase.
A female staff @ CSI refused to call and verify the purchase for us, and what she said was ""Go to the bax office upstair and ask them to verify it for you. I'm busy helping other customers."" There was only 2 customers in line at the time, but we went upstairs anyway. Shockingly, the box office was closed, and the closest one that was still open was like miles away from where we were. Another nice female staff @ CSI kindly told her to look for the manager of CSI to assist us. By this time we've gone down and upstairs a few times. As we were about to ask Vegas Baby for a refund, another male staff came upstair from CSI and told us the same girl, who told us she was to busy, could help us now. If she could help, what was the point to sent us away at the first place. Still we experienced CSI crime scene with excitement but felt really disappointed afterwards. What we did was follow instructions and the case would be solved without any thinking.",1
Arts & Entertainment,Decent family-friendly fun activity. My wife loved it! Not a bad way to kill an hour or two.,3
Arts & Entertainment,"This was something was scoped out when bringing our 8 & 11 year old kids to Vegas. Our parents in their 60's also joined us. You are assigned a crime scene (not scary for kids). You jot down your observations. There are forensics, chemistry, fingerprint analysis, tire impressions, DNA comparisons, digital evidence, etc.  It wasn't overly challenging, but if it were, it wouldn't be appealing for the whole family. Each of our family members did their own form and we assisted the kids here and there. It was a really fun overall experience. We would like to do the other two crimes scenes next time. It's fun to see how observant your kids are and if they enjoy a fun mystery, this is the place to go. We received a discount at $21 per person. If you pay $35, you can do three events through the MGM. In retrospect, we will do that next time. The kids have requested it!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"The people who wrote negative reviews must be no fun! I am a 28yo CSI lover and I am living this!! It's fun :) 
Only downside is it's a bit crowded and you may have to wait a couple minutes to access evidence.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"So I've had a coupon for free admission to this thing that has just been laying around for months. A couple of days ago I decided it was time to finally use them. My philosophy with anything free is ""why not?""

The location of the attraction is close to the deepest caverns of the massive cavern that is the MGM Grand. A place I usually avoid because I never fail to get at least slightly lost. When you enter, you're treated to an overpriced gift shop. Upon paying, they give you a color coded sheet of paper and its on to the exhibit.

I for one am not a fan of CSI, so I was quite jaded at the introduction while everyone around me was cheering. Go figure. After all that wad done, we went to our specific crime scene to ""investigate."" We were given the car crash scene, which ended up being a setup by a drunken man to cover-up killing his twin brother.

The exhibit in of itself was pretty interesting. You draw clues on your piece of paper and take it to the ""lab,"" a series of computer stations and props used to take part in an elementary school-level forensics investigation. It was rather insightful and would be the perfect introduction for a kid interested in forensics. 

All that being said, its a very quick experience. You could be in and out of here in less than 30 minutes. Which made me all the more glad that I had a free admission ticket as admission is $31.50 at face. Ouch. Oh and you dont get anything for cracking your case except having your photo taken (which you have to pay for anyway) and an invitation to their website. Classy.

The Final Verdict

Pros:
Nice way to kill 30 minutes. 
Great for those interested in forensics
Interactive and educational

Cons:
Pricey admission at face. Practically a rip off I'd say.
Only lasts for about 30 minutes.

Return factor. 5/10. Only worth it if I have another free admission coupon.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"This was a mindless exercise that did absolutely nothing to challenge us or spark our interest. We went through the motions of mouse-clicking on various computer screens, sitting back as the software basically fed us the answers.  There was absolutely no thinking or sleuthing required or even allowed on our part.  A complete waste of our time and money.  Wish we could have the time back so we could visit one of the other attractions we missed out on, because any one of them almost certainly would have been better than this.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I'm not a huge fan of CSI, but I was looking around for some smaller, non-major headliner things to do in Vegas one afternoon.  I'm not a big fan of CSI, but I do enjoy puzzles - so my wife and I went in to check it out.

First of all, it was quite pricey for the experience.  Tickets were over $30 each, and in total it took us about 1hr to do.  You go in and analyze a crime scene, and then go evaluate the evidence to see if you can determine the killer.  It's like an adult version of Clue, except in Clue you have to be more observant and take more thorough notes than CSI: The Experience.  The answers were quite easy as if this was intended for a junior high science class.  

It was still entertaining, but I would say that it's only worth $10/ticket for an adult.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"My friends and I are all 30 something's and found this to be quite boring. It starts out with a crime scene and you get a clipboard to make note and try to solve it. However, as you move through the case and analyze various things like blood or fingerprints, you are giving all of the answers and actually don't solve anything. One of the biggest wastes of money and time on our trip to Vegas. Would not recommend if you are expecting to be challenged at all.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"This experience was very disappointing & a complete waste of $63 - the cost for 2 people.  My husband is an investigator, so thought it would be fun for the two of us to do together.  I was wtong. They should do different levels of difficulty.  This was something my 10 year old could have easily solved.  Very lame and I agree with other reviews stating it was low budget for a high fee.  Only wish I would have read the reviews first.  Don't waste your $.  There's plenty of things to do & spend your money on in Vegas - this is not one of them.",1
Arts & Entertainment,Pretty cool experience.  had to gather clues and solve a crime. pictures at the end you can buy are cool. I'd recommend going if in town. about 21 bucks a person.,4
Arts & Entertainment,This is nothing like what it is advertised as. You don't analyze anything. Just walk from station to station and watch a short video. Wish I had helped it before we wasted the money. The info was interesting but I would not go again or recommend it. My teenager was bored.,2
Arts & Entertainment,"In April of 2015, My family went to the CSI experience in Las Vegas and we all loved it. We got to experience all three rooms thanks to a Groupon, which made the experience even better because of the great savings.

The CSI experience is located at the MGM Grand in the District area.

The CSI experience consist of 3 different rooms, each room is a different crime, and has different CSI forensics to consider and solve.

After a short video about CSI, you will be able to enter one of the assigned crime scene rooms with a issued clipboard, pen, and investigation sheet. After you view the crime scene and take notes, you then head off to each of the forensic areas to answer the questions on the investigation sheet. You'll have anywhere between 5-6 forensic areas to help you solve the crime. Some of the forensic areas are; blood transfer, fingerprints, impression evidence, trace evidence, blood pathology, toxicology, DNA, firearms, dental records, and drug testing.

After you visit each of the forensic stations you then visit the last station which is the autopsy/medical examiner, which a video will explain what occurred. There is no blood and guts or cadavers. They show the injuries projected onto a white manaquin, but nothing is gory.

You then go to the final station and reports input your findings and answers the questions into a computer. It will then let you know if your conclusions are correct, and will show you a short video of the crime that occurred as it unfolded. Again, nothing gory.

The CSI experience is more education than problem solving, but still very fun. My wife and two children (age 7 & 9) loved it. My kids spent the rest of the week talking about DNA, blood splatter evidence and fingers prints. It was too funny to listen to them talking and playing detective.

After the experience they will email you a CSI diploma, which we have never received, or you can buy a printed on there with your name on it for $5.

After the experience you can also put on some CSI attire, complete with gun and handcuffs for a photo with cool backgrounds. They cost anywhere from $15-$50 depending on which package you get.

They also have a great gift shop with lots of CSI merchandise.

I would have attached some photos of the experience, but they prohibit photos in the attraction area. Other than the souvenir photo you have to pay for.

Of the three rooms, we all felt that room #1 was best, then room #2, and then room #3. If you don't have a Groupon, I would just do room #1.

I thought the CSI experience was very fun, and very educational. I would recommend this attraction to my family and friends.
Visited March 2015",3
Arts & Entertainment,I enjoyed this experience. It was fun and it killed time. It took us about an hour to complete the entire experience. It The gift shop was pricey . If you want to do something low key during the day then try this. We purchased the 3 attractions for $57 so we got a decent deal,4
Arts & Entertainment,"Do NOT waste your money. There was no detecting to be done. You sit at a couple of computers with a clipboard and they give you the answers so there's nothing for you to even figure out.

I was very disappointed.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Okay so first off I've noticed a lot of hate for this attraction and I sort of think some of it is deserved and some is not. So today was a really hot day in Vegas and I didn't want to stay at home so I decided for some reason to do this CSI thing. It's been in Vegas for years but I never did it so I decided to try it out. I do agree it is a bit pricey, a regular ticket will run you about 35-36 dollars but since I am a local I get in for 26 bucks. So they sort of jilt you on the price because there is 3 cases to solve but you only get one case with a regular ticket. They do however give you a sort of voucher to do the next 2 cases for 10 bucks or to redo a case if you didn't solve it. However there is a slight problem with this voucher. The voucher requires you to have a receipt but the guy behind the counter when you start the attraction takes your receipt from you so I don't really know if I can still use my voucher (it expires after 10 days). So first you have to watch a short video with Grissom (if you're fans of the show you'll love it) who gives you a speech about you being a new recruit and how 3 new cases have landed on his desk for you to solve. My case was a car accident that may or may not be an accident.  You are given a green report (all reports are color coded to your case so you don't get lost) and you are sent on your way to solve the case Sherlock style. So once you get to the scene and I won't spoil anything, you are to look for evidence and draw or write it down in your report and then use the evidence to solve the case using different labs with different methods. So there is a toxicology lab, a forensics lab, a biology lab, and of course the morgue with the body on a slab.  The sad thing is you don't get to use all the labs since you are only given the labs that are color coded to your case. For instance my case didn't require toxicology so I didn't get to play with the vials. There is a nice mini museum so you get to play with the stuff it just might not be required for your case. For instance there was a nice exhibit to showcase blacklight so I got to sort of play with a blacklight and look at blood samples and fingerprints. I will admit the cases are very very easy. I consider myself to be pretty smart and I love CSI, Sherlock, etc but a 10 year old could solve the case since they do sort of give you the answers. For example if a fingerprint matches slightly but not exactly and you checked all suspects then you click unidentified. It's pretty simple. It is a simple game but it's fun nonetheless and it killed a good hour out of the heat and got me out of my house. The lady standing out front was super cute and we even got to flirting a bit and I found out she was a huge gamer like myself. Looking back I should've totally asked her out but didn't........dammit!!!!! Anyhow it's a fun little experience even if it is a bit pricey. I would recommend either getting a groupon or doing it only really if you have nothing to do or if you are a mega fan and I mean mega fan of the show. If you love the show you'll love the experience just don't expect any real challenges as they do sort of give you the answers. I also recommend you either go early or during a weekday when not a lot of people are there. I went today which is a Monday and there wasn't a lot of people there so it had it's fun moments and I got to feel like Sherlock for an hour. If you go when it's packed you have a ton of people bumping into the labs and you see the answers since you have like 6 people at one station solving the same case. Go early and have fun. It's easy but it's actually pretty fun if not a bit pricey.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Very cool for the csi fan! My son, 14, and I did this together. We had a blast! He was so into it! Very cool and fun. Thankful I did it.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Very disappointing. I have to believe that they tailored this to the average 12-year-old. So yeah ... if you're 12, great. This will keep your attention and maybe challenge you a little. Else, don't bother.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I enjoyed The Experience even though I don't watch the show. It was different for me and pretty fun. You have to do an investigation, collect clues, go into the lab to figure out the murder. I am happy to say I have a degree in Forensics in just 40 minutes whereas most get theirs in four years!",3
Arts & Entertainment,"This was awful.. Definitely a huge tourist trap. You have a small area where you look at the crime scene, then go into a common area where you are literally given all the answers. You write them all down on a clip board then answer questions at the end on a computer. They then try to make you purchase a diploma and/or pictures. This is great for kids but AWFUL for adults. Do. Not. Waste. Your. Time. Massive tourist trap. I'm so disappointed. It's not like those mystery/escape room type things, don't be fooled.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I purchased my ticket through groupon which I would highly recommend because paying full price for this exhibit would be a waste of money. I have watched the show CSI but it was many years ago and you don't have to be a fan of the show to get some enjoyment out of this exhibit.

With all that being said I would give this exhibit actually 2.5 out of 5 stars. It's located in the MGM wasn't that hard to find once you enter the exhibit and pay which is actually in the overpriced gift shop you are given your color coded sheet of paper and go and watch a video and work on your case. 

The case was pretty fun to work on and it was interesting working with all the different items to crack your case. I did have a good time but I do think it is a little pricey even with the groupon and it's a down right rip off if you are paying full price.  It was a nice way to kill 30 min. or so.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Respectfully, they just need to go ahead and shut this thing down. I could fathom how a young child may feel important going through it but there is zero requirement to solve anything or use your brain. It felt like I was in a 4th grade social studies group project. The return on investment is not here.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"My friends and I decided to check out the CSI experience since we are all huge fans of the series. We got the ticket as part of a package deal and we thought it could be something different/fun to do. I will not make my review too long so this is the gist of it :
Pros : 
- great educational tool for anyone interested in forensic science even though it's not that detailed
- it is an interactive attraction, making participants take notes of the crime scene. You have to document everything you see
- great for kids 
- great way to kill time

Cons:
- they don't let you take picture (I know this may be trivial but not allowing guests to snap a picture inside the store is ridiculous in my opinion)
- the tickets say it is a 60-90 minute attraction and it's more like 30 minutes in reality
- the tickets are way overpriced for this attraction. We only came here because it was part of a package deal

In conclusion, even if it was an interactive attraction and somewhat educational, if you're in Las Vegas I would suggest doing something else than this.",2
Arts & Entertainment,Waste of time and money. Very disappointed no point of me writing about it all the comments below are true.,1
Arts & Entertainment,"Wow- what can I say?! I am being generous with 2 stars; however my son enjoyed it somewhat, so I'm giving 2 stars. Really- this place needs a major reconstruction. It is a ripoff in price for what you get. Normally it's around 32 per case per adult and 25 per cause per child. There are 3 different cases you can buy- so yeah it can get expensive.

We completed the whole case in less than an hour after going through different rooms to look at evidence or read posters and then answer questions on a paper. This process is very simple for adults but it is more engaging for children. Although the material is not catered to a way kids would pay attention to it- if that makes sense.

What is funny is my son was more excited about the gift shop then the whole exhibit. He found a few souvenirs but was upset upon discovering the CSI Crime scene vest was $50- he became discouraged. 

The photos they offer are outrageous as well. $16 per picture and they shoot 3 different poses. 

My suggestion for anyone reading these is shut this down or start over and re-build an exhibit that has a scene children can do with a group leader and one parents can break off and go into, and is more challenging. 

If they aren't going to change it they should drop the price significantly- like 10 bucks or less a ticket LOL

I'm just glad I got a 20% coupon online..or I would have been really pissed.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I wanted to ask for a refund. I couldn't believe I just spent my money and about $45 mins of my life on that ridiculously boring activity. Although it was boring for me, I do think that it will be highly entertaining for small children and maybe early teens.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"This review is for you scene #3, the one with the bones. Without telling much so I won't ruin the ""experience"", it's really a silly attraction with almost no thought at all. You simply need to click a few buttons and remember what you are told. There is no special logic, no mystery and for a grown adult, not much fun. If you do want to do this attraction (not your kids) don't do scene 3.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"It's fun, but lacking some entertainment. I booked this prior to coming to Vegas because it's something I always wanted to try. We had a reservation at 6pm but arrived at 5pm and they said we could still go in. Heading down the escalator you check in with the cashier where they give you the paper you will need for the investigation. Once inside we watched a quick video and went onto solve a crime.

We had two papers so we had solved two murders. You are supposed to mark down all clues of the crime scene on your paper.  I felt the crime scene could have been more ""real"" it was so dummy like, I just found it boring. Then you move onto different sections to solve the murder with the clues found and compare. After all that you go onto their computer and it asks you a set of questions. If you get them all right you solved the murder. We got both right, which it is not hard at all.

You can get a certificate but you have to buy it. I thought it should come with one since you already paid to be the investigator. We also took pictures in front of a green screen which turned into jail like pictures. It was pretty pricey and I didn't like our pictures so we didn't buy any.

I feel like this has potential, but it needs some readjustments and better technology!",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Great attraction but 2 terrible employees. Arrived on Tuesday afternoon 10-13-15 around 330 or 4pm I think. Had my 3-day big bus ticket that showed free admittance to CSI. First woman that helped me said I was wrong and that I did not know what I had purchased i.e. That it did not come with CSI ticket unless they printed me a separate CSI ticket. Second gentleman said the same thing and both went on about their business and left it up to me to call Big Bus Tours. While trying to find a contact number, a third female employee came by to help me. Offered to call and figure it out for me. Found out CSI was indeed included in my ticket and that it was a miscommunication between CSI and Big Bus that separate CSI tickets weren't printed. With the terrible employees that first addressed me, I can see how the miscommunication happened. Third woman was super nice and gave me 2 crime scenes to process instead of just one. Very fun experience, even for someone who has worked as a probation officer in the past. Fun photo opportunity too.",3
Arts & Entertainment,I loved it! I felt almost like I was on the show. I dont watch the Miami or New York show but Las Vegas is my favorite! And you get to see Gil Grissom ;),5
Arts & Entertainment,"For the price you pay it is just subpar. I was expecting better. There is some positive and it is a cool thing to check out, but it definitely is outdated. The dead ""bodies"" are more of manikins you would see in a department store. The technology is okay but could be better. Overall, the cases are easy and can be solved with no problem (almost seems like it is more geared for children). I did 2 different cases which were both different which was nice, but they were both equally easy. For the price you pay, you would think the experience would be up to date. I love the idea, the execution is just lacking.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"If you let yourself get into it this can be a really good time!  We wen't because we had freebie tickets from the Big Bus tour but I would almost pay for it if we hadn't.  Well maybe if we had a B1G1, although they do a locals discount so that's nice.  
It really was fun ""solving"" the case we were given.  You go through a few different stages examining evidence and deciphering clues.  It was over pretty quickly (30-40 minutes) but that worked well with my ""Squirrel"" attention span.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"purchased the tickets through Groupon. There are 3 different crime scenes. Each group contains 4-5 people. Each person is given a clipboard with you case detail and instructons. You are all taken to one room where the creator of CSI discusses the show, etc. Then you are free to leave and go to your crime scene. each crime scene is colored (pink, blue and green). so the color of your paper and the number on the bottom match up. so as you go along, you should not get lost. You have the crime scene where you write your findings on your case sheet. Then you go along to each station where there are computers setup and you go through a scenario matching up bullet casings, DNA, etc. Once you are finished, your last station is the morgue where the doctor tells you what happened to the victim. The final report is given to Grissom. You sit at a computer and you answer all the questions given to you on the screen. Grissom comes on to tell you whether or not you have passed. If you passed, you get a certificate. before you leave, they take pictures of you dressed up in CSI gear. They also take pictures of you arresting your friend as well. These pictures are available for purchase. You get a discount if you order 2 pictures. There is a gift shop as well.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Very disappointing. There are so many better things to spend your time and money on while in Vegas. No reservation is needed. My boyfriend and I walked in and started right away. The tour is not guided. You walk through different ""stations"" beginning with the crime scene and moving onto the labs. However, the labs are not real ""labs"". Most of the labs are at computer screens where basically you just press next, next, next, finish to get the answer you need, or move around other interactive pieces. I'm sure it's intended to be dummie proof, but some thinking would have been nice. The experience was just cheesy. Then at the end you get your ""diploma"" and take graduation pics BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY MORE. None of that was included in the original charge. The reviews for this were decent so we decided to try it out. Overall, this was not worth the time or money spent and I would advise others to spend theirs elsewhere.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"The case was pretty easy to solve but it was good fun looking over the crime scene, looking at the evidence in the labs and making your case notes. 
There are 3 different cases so they can stagger the number of people looking over the crime scene and all the evidence, which meant it was not too crowded.
Do not pay full price for this event!! There are plenty of places where you can get money off the ticket price so look around. There is a booth on the strip or there are online places to print off a coupon.",3
Arts & Entertainment,Absolutely loved this one! Not to toot my own horn but I figured out the case before I left the crime scene. Even though I was joking about my guess and it happened to be right it makes me feel a bit twisted hahaha,5
Arts & Entertainment,"This was suppose to be a birthday present 2 years ago but we were snowed into NYC and although our luggage made it to Vegas, we didn't! 

This time bought tickets from a ticket booth on the street offering cheaper tickets, while we were buying tickets to a magic show. I asked if only kids did the experience because I didn't want to be the only adult in there - haha, like this has ever worried me BUT kids and parents get annoyed when adults push their kids out of the way & they are distracting. Those of u who know me, know that there are few bigger kids than me. FYI, buy your tickets from a booth it's cheaper! 

I was surprised when there were only adults! Firstly were assigned a case number, there are 3 you can choose from. We decided to try to solve the case on our own which I think was more fun. You watch a short video from a CSI character and then follow the steps on the case sheets to see where to go to next to find the next clues. 

The case sheet is important to write down all your observations and the information you find along the way, for example, what the toxicology report tells you. Yes, you get to push buttons, look in a microscope and match DNA sequences. 

Towards the end you go to autopsy, thankfully the cadaver is plastic and the lights project the bits you need to see (I'm far to squeamish when it comes to blood - yes I look away on tv too!) and you record the information. 

When you have all your data you go to a computer and answer a series of multiple choice questions using your case notes to help you. If you are correct you can have your 'diploma' printed or emailed to you. I think printing was about US$6. 

You can also have photos taken in front of a green screen with different police uniforms. The photos were 1 for $17, 2 for $20+ or 3 for $30. We bought all 3 because it was fun handcuffing each other and playing with gun!!! There are also value diploma and photo packs. 

In their shop there is also lots of merchandise to buy and a penny press too!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I'm not anywhere near a CSI superfan, but we got tickets through a combo package at one of the other shows in Vegas and we've seen the CSI Experience advertised.

The actual experience portion felt like it was spoon-feeding you the clues and less about actually finding them. Definitely doesn't deliver the value you might expect, and not worth a second or third run through to solve the other crime scenes.",2
Arts & Entertainment,The CSI experience was incredible. Very confused as to why it has  such a low ranking. Loved it.,5
Arts & Entertainment,Ahhhhhhh please stay away unless you are a die hard fan of this show. You dont get to choose your case and they try to upsale you for a certificate as well as to do the other two cases. A lot of the stuff there was broken. I felt like it was a ripoff at 20$,1
Arts & Entertainment,"Save your money and your time. This was absolutely boring and mindless. You're basically reading and writing down clues. There is no ""investigation"" and zero fun.",1
Arts & Entertainment,Please don't waste your money. Not even worth 1  star. So boring and lame. They basically just give you a pen and a piece of paper and make you find clues and figure out what happened.,1
Arts & Entertainment,"I have wanted to do this since the first time I went to Vegas and we got some discount tickets at one of the kiosk's on the strip. 

When you go in they give you a certain crime scene to go through with a clipboard and a pen. You observe the crime scene, take notes, and then continue through onto the evidence room. There are 7 different stations you have to hit to solve your crime and I was kind of bummed that all you basically did was click through things on different computers. Obviously we wouldn't be doing anything crazy but I felt like they needed to make things more hands on to appeal to anyone about 14 and up. Plus, you wouldn't take young kids to this anyway. 

Glad we got the cheap tickets though, I would have been mad if we paid the full price!",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I thought the whole experience was *shrugging* alright. I've never watched a minute of the show. I was accompanied by 2 other people, whom I found out dang near 30 minutes after I finished solving the crime in 15-20 minutes, considered themselves super sleuths and really thought they were CSI employees! I was fiddling my fingers for a good 30 min., no lie, waiting on Detectives Take and All Day solve a mini crime. When I identified the suspect, an attendant asked whether I wanted to take a pic, ""Nope!"" The souvenir shop, they ought to be ashamed of themselves peddling that stuff. Plus, I don't even know how to feel about the shirts they were selling, ""Evidence Don't Lie...Men Do"" or vice versa. Who's buying that? Is that a saying on the show? As I make myself back to where I started, to the counter to get another case to solve, the lady says you only get to solve one case per entry fee and to keep the discount flier for $9.99 as well as the evidence paperwork for admittance within the next 10 days to solve the next whodunit. I put that vest back and was thinking to myself, ""Why would anyone pay regular or half off for this experience?"" After I became a trio again, the census was the same. Although we all had a good time, some more than others (as mentioned above), this is a date, gifted, or using someone else's money outing. Don't you dare pay! Lol",3
Arts & Entertainment,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
I love CSI ~ this was a great idea, but poor execution. There was no challenge.
I would say this is a good kid attraction, but I don't think the content would be appropriate for a child. An 8th grader might like it, I am not sure, but as adults, my husband and I both found this experience cheesy and completely stupid.
Also, the establishment does not want you taking pictures while you are in their make believe crime lab. They want to sell you ""THEIR"" pictures for an additional amount of money.
This attraction cost my husband and I $53 total, and we received $5.00 off each ticket. A sheer waste of money and one of the most disappointing attractions I have ever encountered",1
Arts & Entertainment,"The Good: Some interesting stuff.

The Bad: They hold your hand too much. Meant for a younger crowd.

The Review: We wanted to do something other than play the Wheel of Fortune Slots and eat buffets, so we decided to check out CSI: The Experience. I had a decent time, but they really held your hand here. I'm not sure what age range would be perfect for this one. I would say maybe 13-16 year olds that watch violent movies? While I don't regret the $24 I paid for this (bought from those discount ticket stands) I wouldn't recommend this to anyone over 18, that's for sure, even if you're a huge fan of the show.",2
Arts & Entertainment,I was extremely disappointed.  This attraction is for younger children who have an interest in forensic science - not adults!  I was insulted at how easy the puzzles were.  No critical thinking required.  The advertisements mentioned nothing about how this attraction is designed only for children.   Even if you're a huge fan of the show you will be disappointed.   There is only one prop from the tv show and you can see that for free by coming into the lobby.  I only gave this 2 stars because the facility was clean and I can see certain children enjoying this.,2
Arts & Entertainment,"This was one of my planned stops in Vegas, and I was pretty excited to give it a try.
It's easy to spot with a large marquee-style layout at the entrance. Straight down the escalator to a friendly person at the counter for my ticket. As I was there fairly early, there wasn't a wait to get in. The man that gave me the run through was also friendly and enthusiastic. 
A short film introduction & off to the races. There are 3 different cases, to which I did every one (Explorer Pass) Going from area to area, examining the 'crime scene', matching tire marks, fingerprints, blood samples etc. Maybe it was just me, but it took me less than 20 minutes to solve each case. Pretty pricey for such a short time. Have fun, but don't expect it to be an afternoon worth of activity.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"One of the other reviewers had it right, unless you are a kid who likes this stuff, this is just way to simple.  I suppose if you are a superfan of the show, you might enjoy it or if you somehow have significant discount coupons, otherwise I'd pass and go sit by the pool.  Bottom line, too simple and short, you'd be wise to pass.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Lets just say we had a nice time during this experience.  It costs about 60 bucks for two people.  You don't get to take pictures and if you experience it you will know why.  I wasn't too tripping at all about that.  I can't really reveal too much about it without spoiling everything for people.  They do give you a vest in the beginning to enhance the experience.  You get a notepad and pretty much walk around each station writing down notes.

Its actually pretty fun enough I guess.  It kinda reminds me of the old bio labs I use to take in high school.  The experience isn't very challenging though which seems to be the biggest complaint about this but to be honest, I didn't want a challenge anyways lol.  I thought it was fine the way it was.  

Overall if you have some money to spare, this isn't a bad experience at all.  Just don't expect a whole lot.  It was fun but definitely grows tiring as the experience drags on.  Its about an hour long experience depending on how long you take at each station.   Don't spend too much time at the stations.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Do not go. The answers are practically given to you. You walk in, click on computers really really simple. Then they tell you the answer in the end at the operation table. 
Last note. You pay a lot for one crime scene to solve.",1
Arts & Entertainment,For two people almost 60 bucks it's not worth it maybe when the show was really popular it made sense but now no it's not.the whole setup seemed like it was built in 2004 really old outdated stuff and to pay 60 bucks for two people and not take pictures was crap.i would not recommend this attraction at all.,1
Arts & Entertainment,"This really was a waste of time. Cool concept and all.. but there is really no challenge. They give you all the answers and you spend most of your time clicking on the computer to give you the answer and then you walk out and get your ""diploma"". Wouldn't do it again.",1

Public Services & Government,"Luke AFB all I have to say to you is.

You rocked my friggin world.

I was based at you for some time and I was not only a happy Airman but a content one as well.

Your location is ideal for flying, your friendliness is unmatched compared to other bases and your amenities are top notch, the BX here still blows my mind, even after several years of being assigned to a different unit. 

Consider yourself a lucky AF member if you are based here because they're are people in Kunsan just dying to have your slot.",4
Public Services & Government,"Location location location! Luke is a great place to work, the people are friendly, the layout is pretty easy to get used to but the buildings are pretty old. The gym is in need of a renovation (too small for the size of the personnel on base) and the hospital is not really a hospital but a clinic. You would have to utilize the surrounding hospitals and or urgent cares for any emergencies or care after business hours.  Other than that, major California cities are a 4-5 hr drive and Las Vegas could be reached in 4.",3
Public Services & Government,"Attended the Open House and Airshow at  Luke AFB on Saturday, March 19.  If you are thinking of going on Sunday READ THIS FIRST!   Mistake #1 was leaving later than I should have.  Traffic getting there was a nightmare.  Took 1.5 hours to get to off-base parking and that is after I figured out a shortcut that took 30 minutes off the wait in VERY slow stop and go traffic.  Part of the problem was that I was following directions from 3 years ago rather than the online map for this year.  Mistake #2.  My bad.  I'll do better next year.  

Check out the Open House web site (http://fightercountry.org/fighter-country-events/luke-air-force-base-2011-airshow-open-house/72538) for items that you can and cannot bring on base.  The check point is in the parking area before you board the buses.

BTW: Parking is $10 per vehicle and entrance to the base is free.

The off-base parking was a farmer's field that had been cleared and leveled to make way for vehicles.  Dusty and dirty, but it sufficed.  School buses were used to shuttle us to the base and they were lined up and leaving 3 or 4 at a time.  Nice that they did not make us wait long in the field.  Good planning here.

We did not arrive on base until about 1PM and I was afraid we missed some of the best aircraft flights.  Some guy was selling programs and other trappings for $10, but we opted out.  I was greatly encouraged when the F-22 Raptor started it's routine as we were walking towards the flight line.  And holy cow, what a walk!  Maybe 600 feet to the edge of the taxiway.  It was hard to tell if you were making good progress because the vendors and people in folding chairs were spread out all over the place and you really had to snake around to move closer to the flight line.

The aforementioned Raptor was amazing.  I've seen video of it before, but this aircraft is truly something to see in flight.  Because of the vectoring engine nozzles and fly-by-wire system this large jet can remain under the pilots control at extremely slow speeds and high angles of attack.  Funny that the most impressive thing about this Mach capable stealth fighter is its slow speed capabilities.

This year Luke allowed folding chairs (just no reclining lawn chairs) and I brought some in the car.  We decided that, since we were arriving so late, we would not take them in.  Mistake #3.  It did not take long for me to lament that decision since there were plenty of places to set up the chairs and it would have been a lot easier eating lunch.  

Speaking of lunch.  The vendors were everywhere!  I do mean everywhere.  The area allotted for visitors was so vast that they were spread out so far you could not see many of the vendors until you actually walked over much nearer.  You could see some tents and signs all over the place, but what it was you were walking towards was not immediately clear.  There is no ""vendors row.""  Thankfully, some of the vendors had duplicate sites so you wouldn't have to walk a half mile to get the sandwich and beverage combination you desired.  Food is expensive.  Cost for 2 brauts and 1 bottled water = $17.  You cannot bring in food or beverages.

Some very cool planes flew and even more are on static display.  You cannot get close to the Raptor or any plane that is flying at the show, though.  They are parked across the tarmac from the spectator area.  They cancelled the Army Golden Knight parachute team demo.  I do not know why.  They did announce over the PA system, but unless you were standing very near them all it did was create background noise.  I'd say grab a program so you would know what the schedule was, but they got so far off schedule by later afternoon it made little difference.  

Eventually some kids in fatigues were driving around in a cart giving out the programs for free and I then saw that the Air Force Thunderbirds were set to fly next.  It was another hour before they did finally get airborne though.  This is my only real complaint about the air show.  Pacing.  At least that afternoon it moved very slowly.  We actually were leaving just as the ""Birds"" were starting their routine.  We saw a good deal of it on the way to the parking lot.  We decided that we did not want to spend another hour-and-a-half in traffic on the way out.

Overall, I would recommend the open house to anyone who enjoys watching military aircraft.  It is a relaxed event.  If you can deal with long lines getting in, out, and getting food it can be great fun.  Take the sunscreen, umbrellas, folding chairs, and plenty of cash.

Super Secret Shortcut: If approaching from the north on 101 take Bell Rd exit.  W. on Bell to Litchfield Rd.   S. on Litchfield to Peoria.  Officers and signage will direct you W. to the ""B"" lot.  Detail map for last part of above: http://www.luke.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-110304-080.pdf  
If coming from the 303 just get on Waddell and go east to Litchfield.  Could save you an hour unless you're very early.  

 ""A"" lot?  Can't help you.",4
Public Services & Government,"Went to the Luke AFB Open House March 19-20th, 2011.  Great display of aircraft, nice demonstrations, free entrance.  Everything went smoothly, thank you!",5
Public Services & Government,"Our family attend Luke Days on Sunday, March 20th and had a good time.  I love that the admission is free, so everyone can see the airplanes and the show.  We did arrive early so we didn't have any issues with traffic or parking.  Everything was very organized.  The show was awesome and the kids loved it!  We will definately be going again next year.

However, there is room for improvement.  The food was good but VERY pricey.  The kid zone was also very pricey and the lines for the bounce houses were awful.  We waited 30-40 minutes for the kids to go on the rocket ship bounce house and they all agreed that it was NOT worth it.  The rides the older kids wanted to go on, were too much money.  I understand they have to make up for the free admission for $10 per kid to go inside of plastic ball or jump on a trampoline, or $4 for a small fry, or $5 for a lemonade - even Disneyland is cheaper.  

Suggestions for visitors next year:  bring your own chair (rentals are $5 a chair and the ground is uncomfortable), bring your own water but don't open until you're inside, bring plenty of snacks, and don't show your kids the kid zone unless you prepared to spend a lot of money.",4
Public Services & Government,"I have watched the jets fly over since I was 7... coming out over the weekends to watch the jets land and take off with my dad's scanner.

I always enjoy the Luke Day shows... great displays, great crappy food, awesome air demonstrations.",4

It does all those base things.
However, it is too far from where I live and that is where my PCM is! Dang it!! Not their fault I moved to where I did though.

Sooooo yep!",5

Great air show too.

Thank You",5
Public Services & Government,The best kept secret in the Air Force! You can't get any better than than this location. There is something always going on here and if your a sports fan it is paradise. No base has such great access to so much entertainment.  Work is work but when your off duty is what matters the most.,5
Public Services & Government,Tried to attend the Air Force show but after a horrendous 2 hr wait in traffic and and an hour long wait to board a bus we gave up.  Horribly inefficient and horribly executed event.  No one directing traffic and no oversight.  Joke of an event.  Would never even try attending again!,1
Public Services & Government,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR LUKE DAYS ONLY 3/14

God bless America, and I love the military!! 

However, they HAVE to figure something out when it comes to the air show. The traffic and crowd control was horrible. People were screaming, crying, and fighting. I expected a stampede....and this was just to get out! Getting in took 2 hrs. It was really really bad.",1
Public Services & Government,"Cool base, somewhat confusing to drive around.  Lodging is hit or miss.  If you stay, try to stay in the buildings that are south from the office, not north.  I stayed in the older building my first trip here and had black mold in the bathroom and the wifi didn't work.  I asked for the south building the next time and it was great.  Facilities on base are pretty good, however the gym closes pretty early during the weekend.",4
Public Services & Government,"I loved that the rooms at the hotel here are super spacious and come with full kitchens. 

Also love the display of airplanes.  It is really something cool to see.  

I hate that you have to get civilian care as they don't have an actual hospital but whatever.  Not all bases do.",5

Public Services & Government,"I like fast cars and faster jet planes!  

Having recently seen the air show at Miramar in San Diego, I have been bitten by the jet bug. Absolutely amazing to see these fighter planes up close and personal, talk to the pilots, and then watch the air show as the jets zip by with their afterburners blazing and the roar deafening.  Luke Air Force Base was very well organized, they had thousands upon thousands of parking spots with great directions. The walk to the actual show it was quite far in excess of a mile perhaps even a mile and a half. There were lots of vendors selling water for reasonable price of one dollar per bottle.  They must havehad over 1000 Porta potty's located everywhere.There was a huge selection of food vendors, and what I really liked is all the food vendors were spread out over the entire facility not bunched up in a little area. It can get pretty hot on the tarmac considering all the concrete. The highlight of the show was the reenactment of the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor including rebuilt Japanese Zero replicas used in the movie Tora Tora Tora, and P 52's. They even had B-17 bombers, and the MC made sure to tell the whole story of Pearl Harbor. I'm a World War II buff, and having recently been to Pearl Harbor, it was exciting to see this reenactment.  Another real cool thing on this hot day, was the use of rickshaws shuttling people back-and-forth to the parking lots. I'm not sure how much they cost, but for the elderly population they seem to really enjoy this perk.  

The best part, the entire show was free!",4
Public Services & Government,"Review is for the Luke Air Force Base Air Show on April 2-3, 2016

Parking/Getting to the base - located at the corner of Litchfield & Olive in the large open spaced area.  There is another designated parking lot which also serves as handicapped as well but I'm not sure where that one was located.  Be prepared for lots of dust!  
A suggestion would be to leave very early as we left closer to the time the air show started, and it was standstill traffic practically the entire way down to the base via Litchfield, despite police directing traffic which wasn't much help.
Also, do keep note of your parking aisle because that'll be important when returning for your vehicle as the aisles aren't marked.
After parking, be prepared for a security check point - wand, and all pockets emptied, all bags checks - this is only understandable and obvious.
After the security check point, there are school buses available to bring you to the base.

Admission - free.  Food - not free.  Bring cash as I don't believe they were equipped to take credit cards although I can't speak for all vendors.  Lots of other vendors selling snacks, alcoholic drinks, souvenirs, toys for the kids, and I believe I saw umbrellas for the shade and seats to catch the show being sold.

What you'll see - Lots of planes to see - A-26, B-1, B-17, C-17, C-45, C-47, EF-18, F-15, F-35, F-16, KC-135, T-33, T-38, T-6, and the TMB Avenger.  Lots of aerial shows and performances - United States Air Force Thunderbirds, U.S. Army Golden Knights, F-35 Heritage Flight Team, Tora Tora Tora, Acemaker (T-33), Red Bull Demonstration Team, Jack Link's Screaming' Sasquatch, Alabama Boys.
Lots of Luke Air Base personnel to chat with including veterans from various wars.  Lines to see the cockpit of some of these planes were long but they well worth it for me.
You might want to bring sunglasses, sunscreen, a hat, nose/mouth protection if you're sensitive to the dust, lots of water, a seat and umbrella, and ear protection for the kids.

Returning/leaving - be prepared for long lines, to wait for the buses, on your way back to the parking lots.  You may not want to leave exactly at or toward the end of the show if you're in a hurry to get somewhere because of these long lines.

Is it worth it - you bet your sweet bippy it is!  Despite the traffic to get to the show, and the long lines to leave, as an aviation enthusiast and student pilot, this air show was definitely worth it and I will be back when it's next held.",5
Public Services & Government,"This is a really nice installation. I have been to several Army Post, and although Luke does not compare to many of those, it is quaint, relatively clean and the airman are nice. One big thing I've noticed that carries from every military installation is how rude the AAFES employees are. I believe I have complained about them before. I will say that the workers here are the nicest of the lot, although that is not saying much, it does matter and does make a difference in your overall experience. I came today for a medical appointment and the medical staff are always friendly and caring. I think they see an old Army soldier and know they can be a little less soft since they know we can take more. That came out wrong. Army guys are salty, mean and rough, and communicate in grunts and HOOAH's, where airman are more PC I guess, feel free to let me know if I'm completely off base on this one. Anyway, I like Luke AFB I would not have minded living here when I was in.",5
Public Services & Government,"Clear communication is an integral component of every relationship throughout life. For a business, a lack of communication can create many issues including alienating your customer base. Government agencies are unique in that when we do not receive adequate service we cannot simply go to a competitor. The Department of Revenue exemplifies poor communication resulting in poor customer service. 

On a positive note, the list of individuals I spoke with today were friendly and able to each provide some type of information that helped the mysterious puzzle begin to take shape; however, several calls and valuable work time could have been avoided if clear communication were to take place. It is the old adage of one hand not knowing what the other hand is doing. 

Over the weekend I received a letter labeled ""accounts receivable demand notice"" - sounds scary, but more interesting was the fact that I have never received prior communication indicating anything was afoot. There was no explanation, no contact person - only a summarized account balance showing penalties and interest for some unknown event occurring four years ago. 

The first lead was the bolden invitation to visit them on the web, to which the corresponding web site address was unable to provide an further information. On the back of the statement read the message ""if you do not agree with the balance or need further explanation, please call.."". I called the number and spoke with a lady asking for the agent's name and other information I did not have. No worries - I provided my taxpayer ID and she was able to provide the agent's name and phone number. She said she would connect me, but for my information the agent's number was...and as she gave the number she mumbled the last 2 digits. I said excuse me, but I didn't get...too late - I was patched through to the agent's voice mail. The message stated I needed to leave a string of information including my UTI number. I don't know what that is, but I don't think I have it on this form... Still being friendly as not to upset ""the man"" I provided my name and contact information then indicated I had not received a prior letter nor did I have a UTI number, but I did have my taxpayer ID. I clearly stated that I also did not receive the full phone number and requested a return call. Within a few minutes my phone silently vibrated without catching my attention. The agent left a voice mail stating my call was being returned and to please call back. The agent did not leave the office number and the caller ID showed Blocked. Again, I had to return to the general office number and work back to the agent. 

When I finally reached the agent, I received information as to what generated the letter, what was needed and why it occurred. The agent stated I should next call the collections number or I could set up something on the department web site. But even if I did the web site, I should cal the number to prevent them from taking it further. I chose phone call. In calling the collections department the person answering the phone asked the same questions and suggested I contact the agent. When I indicated that I had already spoken to the agent and it was suggested I phone collections, the representative was puzzled why the agent would send me to them. I was told that the issue was coded to auditing and should contact them to really get it resolved, but since auditing told me to call collections, maybe they could set it up on their end. My information was taken including name, address, SSN, employer, bank, etc. I indicating I would pay half of the bill this month and the other half next month. I asked if I would be sent a bill. I was told probably not - but I could phone in each time and pay over the phone. 

While each person was friendly and had at least a piece of the puzzle (which is the reason for the second star), the entire ordeal took longer than an hour and would have continued to run in loops. The agent suggesting I contact the collections department to avoid further issues and collections suggesting I contact the agent to prevent further issues shows how well they have the run around game down to a science. Maybe it would be too easy for one person to field the call, give an explanation and take the steps to resolve the issue. Oh, you want to pay? Let me set that up for you. Thanks! I guess three different offices and tossing people back and forth is a way to ensure job security.",2
Public Services & Government,A State agency.  I have worked for 4 agencies and this is one of the best.  Caring and compassionate management and friendly coworkers.,4
Public Services & Government,Review is based on quality of service just by dropping a payment off. Easy to find. We did find parking immediately. Walk in quick check of purse. Go through metal detector. Get in Line which was not long at all. All windows open.  Length of time in line was about less than 10 minutes.  They only take cash or check.  Come prepared and you will be taken care of quickly.  Walk out and you are done.  That was my experience.  Hopefully it goes well with anyone else that has to visit.  Oh and do not forget receipt for your records.  For the end of the month this was not bad. much quicker and safer than your last minute online payment.,3

We saw two retro coffee tables we liked that were in perfect condition, both were under $30. We bought a pair of couches there that were perfect to fit in the small space of our apartment and he threw in one of the tables we liked for free. Also their delivery service is only $25. Super friendly, super knowledgable owner - this is a great place to stop in for that hard-to-find piece of retro furniture",5

As a collector of everything owl, I go to thrift and retro shops to seek out pieces for my stockpile. I haven't found any here yet, but I'll keep trying when I'm in the area. I have found some funky coffee table books, art, and ashtrays. 

If you appreciate things from decades gone by, it's definitely worth stopping in. One never knows what they'll find!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I've stopped in Mostly Mod quite a few times since I first walked in and fell in love with the pair of couches I got. Bernie and Drew, the owners, remember us by name and what styles we're interested in, and details about our house to recommend pieces that they have to suit our space. They're usually well-versed on the history of each item - not only it's production, but usually all the way through its life. Yes, the store is still small enough to go over in a few glances, but I swear if I had a bigger home to put it in, I'd leave with something every time.

After months of looking for a kitchen table we liked(And every time we walked in, they would say 'Hey we have a table you might want to take a look at') we finally found love at first sight at Mostly Mod once again - and the large glass-top table, 4 chairs, and delivery came to $250.

Bernie and Drew have a pretty extensive list of regulars it seems, so the good pieces sell quickly. As they dropped it off, they let us know that the day after we purchased the table, someone else had tried to buy it. The story was the same with our couches, after they were delivered someone had come in the store looking for them specifically.

We stop in a few times a month to chat and see if anything catches our eye. If you're looking for something specific, ask - they might have something you'd like not being displayed.",5
Restaurants,"Geez.  I wish I'd travel with people that have some friggin sense of adventure.  Would have much rather have checked out the Omelet House in Vegas, so allow me to vent.

That said, this place is adequate.  Convenient to gas, restrooms, and store.  NOTHING spectacular.  Similar to an IHOP or a Denny's.  Prices maybe a little better.

Ordered a BLT.  Standard fare.  They brought out everything but the BLT.  Forgot to make.  Also, shouldn't have ordered the cole slaw.  Yuck.  They took it back and told me to help myself to the soup.  Sandwich, when it arrived, was good.

Wait staff was friendly.  Parking was plentiful.  Come here if you've missed anything interesting because there is nothing else for miles beyond.  Don't forget to fill the tank.

Restaurants,"Well lets see after our group of 8 was seated by the rudest server at two different table we asked if we could could push the two tables together. She looked at us and responded ""I guess"" and stood there and watched myself and mother try to make this happen with two small children and no help from her! We then sat down and she took our drink order before passing us off so she could serve her 3 tables around us. I looked around and spotted another employee sitting in the corner texting ( at.first.no big deal maybe she was on break). We then had our order taken by a young nice lady, we ordered food from the kitchen and 4 buffet lunches. We then got up to get food from the buffet where I witnessed an employee bare handed grabbing food from the line and then shoving it in her mouth! I watched this happen at least 5 times with all different foods that were out. We then waited and waited for the kitchen food to come out, when it finally did everyone one around us had been fed including the table sat after us and everyone who had ordered buffet was finishing eating! As we are sitting there finishing up I look over to see the same employee still sitting at.the table in the corner now conducting an interview/ or hiring a new employee. I asked who she was she was the manager on duty Erika. Not only was she witness to everything that happened she sat there listening to us loudly talk about what had happen and did nothing! she was to busy to even stop texting on her cell to conduct her interview properly. She did take a minute to stop our server and had her get her coffee since she couldn't be bothered to get up and do it herself ! The food is over priced and not very good so to add crappy service and you have Iron Skillet Las Vegas NV!",1

Restaurants,Friendly staff and good home cooking. Coffee is really good too.,5
Restaurants,"The only reason we were here for breakfast was because it was right around the corner from the Vegas Speedway Race Track.  

First off, the buffet food was garbage.  The chili tasted looked like dog food.  Everything just seems like it's been out on the counter for a long time.  I opted out of the buffet and ordered some pancakes with a side of hash.  It's like your typical Dennys or IHOP feel.  It does it's job and you really cant' ask for more.  You kinda know what to expect at this type of place.  

Service: Our waitresses were very nice and even gave us to-go cups for our ice teas.  The food came out super slow though even though it didn't seem that busy in there.  

Bottom line: Again, you get what you pay for around here in Vegas.  For this to be a truck stop, it's not bad.  They even have laundry and shower facilities on site!",3
Restaurants,"Nothing like greasy heavily buttered food to get you through the long day of either being a trucker, taking the 15 into or out of vegas, or doing something at the motor speedway.

Been to Iron Skillet many of times and if you're expecting something classy and low caloried HA good luck!

It's American comfort food and it's good for the most part. I've eaten here a few times a month when i used to work for a motorcycle racing association back in the day and due to a lack of options the Iron Skillet was always the place to go. It's close enough to the motor speedway so no one has to go to the opposite of our destination just to meet up and have a meal, and it's fast.",3
Restaurants,"After a visit to Glittering lights we were looking for a place to eat and so hungry we stopped at the first place.  Well after years of looking, I finally found a place with a worse buffet than circus circus.  There was litterally nothing edible other than the salad which was borderline. If you are on a diet, this is the buffet for you.   They had several things that were unidentifiable.  We couldn't even eat the soup.

Dissapointing because the concept seemed good and the kitch level is mid to high.",1
Restaurants,"Haven't been here myself in a few years and I am surprised to read the terrible reviews. The food here was delicious. The fried chicken was great and we even used to order large orders for take out for big groups. Like a lot of other places around here, the administration probably won't pay the salary required to get a trained chef.

Very sad",2
Restaurants,"Honestly, we weren't expecting much from this truck-stop greasy spoon, but it looked like the last chance for breakfast before Valley of Fire.

We were pleasantly surprised.  We would up getting the $10 ""Sunday Brunch"" that even included mimosas.   Brunch and mimosas at a truck stop?  Yep, and it was good.  

Loved the make your own waffle iron.  All of the food was pretty good, except maybe the scrambled eggs.  So we asked for a couple fresh scrambled eggs and we got them--no problem.

We had great service too.  I was quite impressed with this little place.  It also had a decent convenience store and very clean restrooms.

Definitely worth a stop on the way out of town!",4

Restaurants,"This little truck stop diner is great! They serve typical diner fare and comfort food. I've been here a couple of times, usually on my way out of town on a camping or hunting trip. The food is delicious and portions are huge, as we usually have to take leftovers to go. 

My personal favorite is the chicken fried chicken - you can even make it a double order for an additional  $2.99! They also have a buffet during lunch and dinner, but I have not tried it. Looks decent for $10.99 though. 

The staff here is nice and I've never had a problem with our orders or having our drinks refilled. The food comes out hot and fresh, and fairly soon after you order. It does get a little crowded here on weekend mornings or when there are events at the Speedway so plan accordingly.",4
Restaurants,"I cannot believe how this place is still in business! If it were possible, I would give them a 0 star rating. Me and my grandpa were on a road trip from Washington to Arizona, and had the misfortune of making a pit-stop here. The first lady we encountered was nice enough, just told us to sit anywhere there's an open table. As we walked down towards the booths, we saw the buffet table. It looked very sub-par and unimpressive.

 We were about 10 feet from an empty booth when a different waitress starts -YELLING- at us! ""YOU CAN'T SIT THERE, YOU CAN'T SIT THERE, THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE!!"" She screamed. We weren't even at the booth yet, so we looked up at her like ""really?"" then turned to the right. Before we even took another step, this nasty woman is yelling at us again. ""YOU CAN'T SIT THERE!! THAT'S WHY I PUT MENUS DOWN!!"" And she rolled her eyes at us.

We didn't even get to sit down. This horrible waitress practically ran us out of the restaurant. My grandpa and I looked at each other and decided to take our business elsewhere. He said ""You have a good day"" as we were exiting, and the waitress gave us a horrid scowl as we walked out the doors. It's probably a good thing we didn't eat there anyways, the food looked disgusting and the managers are okay with hiring scumbags who lose business.

DO NOT BOTHER WITH THEM!",1
Restaurants,"We were hungry and this was the only restaurant we could get to... It was actually really fun! The grilled cheese I had was so so so good... Can't tell if it's because  I was so hungry or if it was actually good... My husband got chicken fried steak and ate every scrap. We got some coupons from the truck stop (classy, I know) and used those. We are not an overweight couple but we ate like pigs and loved every minute. If I had to choose between that and a subway I would choose subway but that was fun for a night and it would be a good choice if you need some comfort food. (We got hit by a car on our way out of town and we're pretty shaken up...)",4
Restaurants,Im giving this place 5 stars strictly for the pancakes. They were honestly the BEST pancakes I have ever had in my life. And me and my hubs are pancake snobs.,5
Restaurants,"Uuuggh so full!
Decided to try out this place for breakfast. I was tired of my usual Farmer Boys (I love them too), but wanted to see what else was out in my neck of the woods. My cousin mentioned this place by the speedway and I'm glad we went. 1st off PANCAKES are phenomenal. I had the ham and cheese omelet w/ a side of hash browns and their biscuits. It was super yummy. Next time I want to try their biscuits and gravy. My girlfriend had the French toast sandwhich and that too was pretty good. The only thing I felt, was that the toast needed some flavor to it. I ended up just diping it into some syrup  ... My cousin got the breakfast combo and didn't leave a single piece to share! Lol 
For being at a truck stop, the place can serve up some pretty decent breakfast meals

I gave this place a 5 because they were quick to bring us our menus, drinks, and food. The server also kept checking on us even though she did have larger tables to assist, so that's always a plus when I don't need to ask for my server!",5
Restaurants,"Buffet was really terrible.  Do not get lured in just because you are starving and need a hot meal. Order something safe off of the menu.  I am just not sure how you can make terrible macaroni and cheese or even a terrible brownie!  A boxed brownie mix and boxed Mac and cheese tastes 200% better.  Heed the warning, my friends.",1
Restaurants,"This is the crappiest buffet but I love it!!  Me n the hubs come here for lunch a lot.  One time we came and they had little cups of cake on the buffet for dessert.  It was like somebody working in the back finished frosting a cake, stepped back to marvel at her masterpiece, then accidentally knocked it on the ground.  And instead of throwing it away she scooped it into little cups and decided nobody would notice.  
The food there is good!!!  I dunno about dinner but lunch is solid if you're not picky.",4
Restaurants,"Hard to find a good diner/greasy spoon in Vegas
Food is always fresh & good Service is even better, always nice and pleasant 
Do yourself a favor and drive 15 minutes out of Vegas get service, prices and value you deserve",5
Restaurants,Its a truck stop. Good food quick service. This place always hits the spot for a quick hunger fix. Their breakfast buffet is filling and full of great choices. try the waffles.,4
Restaurants,Yummmmy yum yum this is we'll worth the stop and the staff is super friendly and fun our waitress was awesome you have to stop here . It seriously is awesome and fun . Great place . The food is really good I like it it . Stretch your legs look around and I hope your hungry,5
Restaurants,"I try to eat at Iron Skillet every time I find myself in the valley.  It is my favorite lunch place and has been for this past 10 years!  They serve a great buffet; and at an excellent price!  The variety of salad toppings is pleasantly sufficient, and the other food usually has your choice of two or three types of meat, a few vegetables, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  Great tasting down-home food!  The staff is very nice and have surprised me one day when they remembered my last visit :)",5

Restaurants,"On the way out of Las Vegas, I stopped for food and fuel. The Iron Skillet buffet really looked good. By themselves, tater tots aren't all that much. I'm not sure what was in it, but the sauce and cheese that were added to the normally bland tater tots made them amazingly delicious.",5
Restaurants,"Decided to stop by before heading out to the speedway.  Its a truckers joint on the outskirts of town.  They have driver only seating that is mostly small comfortable booths. Then the buffet area...

I went during breakfast hours... Nice simple selections.  But the best is the DIY hot waffle iron. Warm syrup is the best...

Ill probably check in for lunch...stay tuned",5
Restaurants,"I may have went there expecting too much from reading the previous good reviews. It was on my way back into Vegas so I thought why not give it a try. Its just a typical average truck stop buffet, nothing special or anything to rave about. keep on trucking",2
Restaurants,"I can only speak for tonite 12.8.15
I got no service till I was about to leave.
Gal finally brought me a glass of ice tea
I noticed she was only tending to one table. Hell the manager wouldn't leave the cash register to see if the patrients were getting served...all i can say is I'VE HAD BETTER SERVICE IN JAIL",1
Restaurants,This place is ghetto and great!  Ws with  party of 5 and all the bills were split correctly and out waitress was awesome.  Will be back for the salad bar.,5
Restaurants,Good food and good service. The buffet wasn't too bad either. The seafood was amazingly good also.,4

 Buffet did not look good at all. Wife had decided club sandwhich would be a safe bet. I had chicke fried steak w/mashed potatoes. Both meals were good. Breading on steak was crispy and flavorful.",2

Local Flavor,Arizona Falls is a not-very-well known attraction on the Arizona Canal at 58th Street. It is one of my favorite places in Phoenix to go and to take out of towners to. It once was a watering hole for people and was a hydroelectric dam. In 2003 it was rebuilt very well and had gorgeous waterfalls put in overhead that you can walk under. It is open 24/7 and is free to visit. It's hard to explain how amazing this venue is so you'll just have to go visit for yourself.,5
Local Flavor,"This is a good place to relax (the sound of falling water is always relaxing) while taking in some tidbits of history of the area and increasing your awareness of green energy. The Arizona Canal drops 20 feet at this point and this was a favorite picnic area for Phoenicians in the late 1800s. Since the early 1900s, the falls were used to generate hydroelectric power and has since been redesigned to be an park where art, history, and technology are combined for the enjoyment of the public. Enter through the G.R. Herberger Park on Indian School Rd. near the Scottsdale border. In the parking lot you'll see the beginning of the walkway to the falls.",4
Local Flavor,"I've lived here all of my life and had never heard of this place until Mike took me here one day a couple of years ago. What a well kept secret! Cool place to sit and relax and just listen to the falls. I've come here during the day and night and felt pretty safe.  

Parking is just a short walk from the falls and it is free to visit!",4
Local Flavor,"I live literally around the corner from this place, and only found out about it because of yelp. It is awesome, a little stinky, but awesome! We packed a lunch and headed over there a while back. We were the only ones there and we had a great time. Taking pictures, looking at everything and relaxing to the sound of the falls. Great day!",4
Local Flavor,"It's a nice oasis in the desert for those of us raised by water.  It's 24 hrs too, which is great for us night owls.",4
Local Flavor,Wow! This is a hidden gem! I found this place while cycling along the canal early one morning. It is very peaceful and serene. One can take a load off and get lost in the waterfall for hours. I would love to see the waterfall in the evening or at night!,4
Local Flavor,"This place is awesome!  How did I not know it existed?  No one I have told about it has ever heard of it either.

Sit between the waterfalls and listen to the beautiful sound.  Fun to take pictures and feels so much cooler surrounded by all the water even in the middle of summer.  Had fun watching all the huge catfish.  Looking at the bizillions of shells in the dirt around the canal.

Kids got to learn about hydroelectricity.  

A great adventure!",5
Local Flavor,"I love neighborhood areas with a story. This space has an interesting story to tell so read the information that is posted and then enjoy the cooling spray of the falls. I am sure that sometimes this area is jam packed with families. 
Enjoy this little park. You can't miss it as it is right on Indian School Road.
Bring your dog or your whole family here for some outdoor fun and splash around.",5
Local Flavor,"I mean, it's not necessarily worth a big outing or anything, but what an awesome little spot. Some history, some technology, some art, and a nice place to cool off in the heat. A fun hidden gem.",5
Local Flavor,This is a water reclamation center not an actual waterfall the water does fall and you can get nice pictures there as shown below but again it is a water reclamation center not an actual fall.,2
Restaurants,Unbelievable steak panini!  Cookies are wonderful.   My wife and I  try to meet here for lunch at least once a week.   I can't say enough good things about this place.,5
Restaurants,"When I heard that Pasqual's reopened their Verona location, rebranded as Gallup Coffee and Bakehouse, I was initially excited.  There aren't many (any?) fast-casual options in my neighborhood of far southwest Madison or Verona.    

Gallup's no longer has the southwest/New Mexican focus of Pasqual's,  but instead offers pastries, coffee, breakfast, and most recently, lunch options.  It is the second Gallup to open - the first is attached to the Hilldale Pasqual's, and does not offer lunch.  The Verona location is only open until 1:30, which is also worth noting if you're looking for a late lunch or dinner.

I tried the Balzac calzone ($9.50), and truly hope it is not an indicator of the rest of the menu.  The menu said the ingredients were meatballs, artichokes, parmesan, and garlic, with a side of pizza dipping sauce.

What I got was a decent sized calzone stuffed with cheese and a soupy, watery marinara sauce, with solid, flavorless chunks of meatball.  And no artichokes to speak of.  I figured, that, for the price, there would be lots of artichokes mixed in, and saw nor tasted none at all.  The artichokes made this item unique to me, and was the reason I ordered this item.  In addition, large portions of the calzone were extremely salty, to the point of being disgusting.  There were also chunks of onion, which I attributed to the marinara sauce - neither of which were discussed by the menu.  The crust was decent, but the pizza sauce was ice cold, which could be a put off for some.  

Overall, the calzone was a disappointment, which was too bad, because I would love to see this local business succeed.  I'll probably give them another chance and come back to try breakfast or a different lunch option.",2
Restaurants,Gallup was in the original Pasqual's - Verona location and stayed open after Pasqual's closed. Now Pasqual's has re-opened but without Gallup.,3
Restaurants,"Matt is absolutely incredible with his knowledge, customer service and all around skill. This place is amazing despite all the horrible reviews. Ask him about any of the 100 or so tequilas and watch him take your order without writing anything down! Please! He's incredible! Melinda, the manager, is also very friendly and knowledgeable with her peoducts and great with customer service! I hate that people use YELP for bad experiences and never for the great experiences that happen daily especially at this restaurant! Try it for yourself! It's great!!!!!",5
Restaurants,"I had high hopes since this place is located in the same building as my gym and next door to my office.  But after two attempts, it's not likely that I'll return.  If there's a line, plan on waiting.  It's slow.  On the first trip I ordered the chicken sandwich special.  It tasted like a frozen piece of flavorless chicken on an enormous bun.  On the second visit I figured a salad would be a safe bet but the greek salad had little substance and the dressing was tart.  It tasted like red wine vinegar.  And I was hungry when I left!",2
Restaurants,I have worked in Southpark for over a year and just noticed this little cafe tucked within an office building in Colonial Plaza beside of ZX Fitness.  I had the Southwest chicken wrap and thought it was great.  Fast service too.,4
Restaurants,Great breakfast place. Quick and friendly service. Good food and prices. They have lunch as well which I will be trying out soon.,5
Restaurants,"Food is exceptional! Being a foodie as well as a local business owner, I search for local establishments that have great product/service. Park Central is in this category. The food is fresh, well prepared, affordable, and even when there is a line, you will be in and out within 5 minutes. Great job Mark and thanks for the great service. Also, order the buffalo wing wrap with ranch and the pasta salad, awesome stuff!",5
Restaurants,"The prices went up after new ownership and the quality stayed the same. Also, less daily specials and less items on the menu. Two stars for convenience, otherwise one star.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I recently visited Piedmont Row for the annual Christmas Tree Lighting.  There was a train ride for the kids, although some adults took a ride as well, along with artful balloons, hot chocolate, and chocolate marshmallows.  All events were free.  It was a cold night, but a great time was had by all.  The restaurants were booming with revelers getting into the holiday spirit but there was a lot of drinking going on this Friday night.  I would suggest bringing the kids during the daytime hours and during special events and definitely leaving them with a sitter on Friday night.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"This is a cool little shopping/eating area with options such as Taco Mac, Del Friscos, Brio, Georges Brasserie.  There are a limited number of parking places out on the street and also a decent sized parking deck.  

They sometimes have music out in the circle (sort of a mini Alive After Five concept) and for the concerts, they set up bars around the perimeter of the circle so that you can easily grab a beverage while enjoying the music.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"A great place to meet friends, walk around, people watch and to live. I moved into the condos here recently and I am very happy with the over all community, shopping and dining. 

Park in either the west or east structure for easy access to everything. They also offer valet for Brio, Georges and Del Frisco. All of the restaurants have great outdoor areas for the nice summer days and nights. 

During the holidays they light a Christmas tree in the center of the circle and decorate really nicely with lights on all the trees. It makes the courtyard very warm and inviting.

Dining here: Brio (Italian), Georges (French), Del Frisco (Steak house), Taco Mac (Mexican-ish), Terrace Cafe (great breakfast and brunch items - best bloody mary ever), AZN Asian (Chinese) - there is also a wine bar, cigar bar, frozen yogurt place, hair salon, dry cleaner, YMCA and other corporate businesses (like scott trade and etrade).

Best bars to hang out in are Del Frisco (for posh style and some celebrity sitings), Brio (for good priced small bites and reasoable wine by the glass.)",5
Arts & Entertainment,"To eat well is to live well...You will definitely eat well at BRIO. Elite Dining Divas took a midweek stroll to Brio Tuscan Grille on Piedmont Row in South Charlotte for happy hour. This turned out to be a wonderful evening. The service, atmosphere and food were top notch. We were immediately greeted by the hostess and since we were there for Happy Hour was seated promptly in the bar area which is spacious, comfortable and a great spot to see and hear the live entertainment.
If you are looking for fine dining on a budget, this is a great restaurant. Monday-Friday from 4p-7p and 9p-11p (bar area only) you can enjoy their $2.95 appetizers and $5.00 martinis while listening to great live music from local bands. The shrimptini, chilled shrimp served in a martini glass with roasted tomato cocktail sauce and fresh lemon and the spicy shrimp & eggplant, pan seared shrimp with romano crusted eggplant and a black pepper cream sauce were couple favorites amongst our group. BRIO offers a lunch, dinner and Kid's menu daily along with a brunch menu on Saturdays and Sundays. BRIO is a great spot to meet friends after work.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I've been here twice and have had nothing but fun, fun, and more fun creating my art both times. I've only done the glass fusing but they also offer pottery painting. 

The space in the shop is great - walls lined with pottery pieces galore to paint as well as glass fusing pieces made by the staff to inspire artistically-challenged customers like myself. There is a cozy room for private parties or events. The staff members are all smiley, knowledgeable of the crafts, awesome at helping out and providing ideas if needed. *Look for Shannon w the purple hair. She is fantastic w the glass fusing! 

The price points for the products are not bad - 4 glass pendants (necklace, w/o chain though) for $25, 6 glass pendants (bracelet) for $29. If you sign up for the email list you get coupons that sweeten the deal even more ($5 off, $10 off during your birthday month, etc). 

Even though this studio is a trek for me (20 miles), I don't mind burning up the gas in my car every now and then for this place - especially for their Ladies Night Out events at which they provide apps and wine and all you pay for is what you make. I mean, hello?! 

Looking forward to my next visit to Art Space Studio.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I've been here a few times and it's hit and miss. Some associates are super nice and attentive. Others...not so much and you are left on your own or asking tons of questions. 

The store is cute, lots of ideas and finished items to inspire. The prices are a tad higher than other places I've been.  And again, sometimes I'd get frustrated with the lack of assistance offered. But when you get a good associate, it's a great place to create memorable products.

PS- great place for infant feet and hands prints!",3
Arts & Entertainment,Great place to have a fun night out and create some awesome memories and art work.  We have a family tradition of going there a couple of times a year to create pieces as my son grows older.  They have a full selection of lots of creative pieces you won't find anywhere else.  They also have a private room for ladies nights out or kids birthday parties.  I definitely recommend you give it a try and you'll be hooked.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"I echo the review below that the associates can make the visit truly memorable. I've had both sides of the coin. That said....guys, if you are looking for a fun date idea, something different...DO IT!!! Trust me...a great ice breaker+you pick your piece up a week later so hopefully a second date.
Dads of little girls...you too must do this too! Especially if you are a single dad. Get messy with your little princess+you'll have something she made on your shelf. (Chixfila before and Cold Stone after and you've got a whole afternoon planned)",5
Arts & Entertainment,Came here to paint Christmas ornaments with my son. I think I enjoyed the activity more than my son did. I would love to come back for a ladies night event. It's also a great way to spend some quality time with the kiddos. I just wish it didn't take a week to get items back.,4
Restaurants,"See, here's the thing: I am on a regimen, this summer.  A watching-what-I-eat, running-every-morning regimen.  It has some benefits; namely, the twenty pounds I've shed.  It does, however, make it a lot harder to eat out when running errands .

For example, earlier this week, I had just gone to the eye doctor at the Carolina Place Lenscrafters, and I was milling around the mall, waiting for my new glasses to be ready within the promised hour.  It was lunch time, but healthy food court options seem limited.  I finally settled on Great Wraps.  They had quite the line going, and they smelled good, so I figured they must be good.

My figuring turned out to be correct.  I had a hummus veggie wrap in a spinach tortilla, and while it wasn't the best thing I've ever eaten, its quality actually surprised me.  The hummus was smooth and garlicy and the vegetables were fresh and crisp.  It was affordable, too: you can get a combo for somewhere between seven and eight dollars.  If you're in Carolina Place, you should give Great Wraps a try.",4
Restaurants,"Great food and great service!!! Quick and very polite. Can't wait to try all their wraps. Chipotle chicken was awesome! Ultimate fries totally worth it. Free drink refills just like Chic-fil-A. Food was fresh and they will make to order if you are picky. We came to the food court just for this, not for mall shopping. Next door to Dairy Queen for dessert...bonus!",5
Restaurants,"Went there today and I noticed that they have new fry bags and I personally find them inconvenient because using the spices are hard to spread evenly. I simply asked how come they got rid of the styrofoam containers. And the guy at the service was being really rude. His expression tone and word choice said ""deal with it"". I also noticed when I got to the car they use STORE BOUGHT ketchup. I would understand if this was a single restraint but there are multiple locations for Great Wraps. At least the fries and spices were good.",2
Restaurants,"Great Wraps is the perfect wrap with fresh and delicious flavored.  Located in food court of mall and surrounded by many other popular food chains, but if you really want fresh and tasty, I'd recommend Great Wraps from a person traveling on business and tired of fast food.",5
Restaurants,One of the best burgers I have ever eaten. Great fries. Great service. Lots of toppings. Will come back every time I am in the area. Yum!,5
Restaurants,"Best. Milkshake. Ever. 

I decided that after a long day at work I wanted a treat....no correction...I deserved a treat for making it through the workday...lol...so I stopped at Cook Out for a chocolate milkshake and some onion rings...


When I saw the milkshake...my mouth watered and then I tasted it and...OH MY GOODNESS....delicious!!! Creamy, thick and super delicious taste...it was perfect! 

The onion rings were hot, just made to order...and I was in heaven! Crispy and hot...just like I like them!!!

I'm truly a new fan of Cook Out and I'll be back for my milkshake fix...very soon!",4
Restaurants,"BLT, Burgers, Fries, Barbecue, Milkshakes - Excellenté. Ridiculously cheap. Fast service.",4
Restaurants,"Tasty fries. Very bad cheeseburger. Claimed to be charbroiled, no charbroil flavor at all, no char marks on meat.  Meat had a livery, gamey flavor, and was dry. Took two bites and threw it out.",2
Restaurants,"Do NOT go there! This restaurant stole my credit card information and sent it to someone in Georgia, who tried to buy lots of stuff. Luckily, my credit card company caught it in time. The restaurant is already under investigation for criminal behavior. Buyer beware!!",1
Restaurants,"Typical fast food joint with tons of different options to satisfy the inner fast food junkie in you.

The milkshakes here are really good. And you can customize them however you want. Their burgers and fries are not bad either.

Local Flavor,"One of the objectives of the new CityCenter is to create ""dynamic public spaces.""  Crystals Place is a public art collection located on the main drive into CityCenter.  You'll find wonderful examples by Rodney Lough, Jr., Dale Chihuly in ""the GALLERY,"" Richard MacDonald's Cirque du Soleil-based sculptures, and contemporary works in the CENTERpiece showcase.  These free galleries, in addition to the cool artwork you'll find on the grounds of the CityCenter by Maya Lin, Nancy Rubins and others, are intended to transform CityCenter into a cultural centerpiece for Las Vegas.",4
Local Flavor,"A string of galleries presenting really cool, expensive art.  The Chihulys were wonderful, but it was the Rodney Lough's wilderness photographs that really piqued our interest.  He uses a 8x10 camera.  It's HUGE.  But the prints produced with this camera are so realistic it looks like you're viewing the subject through a window.  Definitely recommend.",4
Local Flavor,"Friends will ask me, ""So what do you like to do in Vegas, just gamble?""

Crystals Place is an example of how Vegas has so much more to offer than gambling.

The Gallery:  You need to stop by just to take in awe the bronze works of Richard MacDonald scattered around.  Of course you will also find the glass works of Dale Chihuly and the breathtaking photography of Rodney Lough Jr.

Crystals also has high end shopping like Tiffany if that sort of thing floats your boat.

No charge to see the art!  Be sure to look around for all the art in City Center because it has a lot to offer.",5
Local Flavor,"In Las Vegas, amongst the glitz, lights, night life, booze, gambling and shopping (don't get me wrong, these are all pretty fantastic in this 2 mile block of Southern Nevada along the world famous Vegas Strip!), art can often be an after thought.   A moment in which in your burry eyed, foggy state of boarding your return flight home, you might vaguely remember a giant thing with tumbling numbers or a giant tree house looking thing you thought was a restaurant.  But make no mistake, those items (which are indeed public art) have been placed there for you to see, experience, be mesmerized by and enjoy....whether you actually knew it or not. 

Crystals and the City Center area that surrounds it, is a treasure trove of some of the city's greatest contemporary, cool art installations.  From the cool Mihajima Marks U.S debuted piece that went in to Crystals last year, to the funky cool tree house that houses Maestros designed by David Rockwell or James Turrell's Akhob located inside Louis Vuitton (appointments required, so call well in advance)...great art is everywhere at Crystals!  

Look up City Center Art Collection before you visit, for if art is your thing, this is a fun scavenger hunt around City Center, in addition to Crystals (the shopping entity at City Center).   Most of the pieces are large and can make you travel around the entire site to discover.  The art at Crystals can rotate from time to time, so keep your eyes peeled for new stuff during each visit.",4
Public Services & Government,"Much better than Urbana's governance. The Mayor is a mere figurehead, and the City Manager has a level of insulation, allowing for more non-political decisionmaking. Everyone is nice, and Champaign as a city is great.",5
Public Services & Government,"Permit parking division is very rude. We pay almost $700 for a parking spot and they treat us like we owe them something. When I went to get my parking permit, the African-American guy completely ignored me for the first 30 minutes. Then he told me to apply for the permit on the computer. I wonder, why did I even come here when I could have done this from home. Anyways, I make the payment and he said I did it incorrectly (that I should not have submitted) and I have to come in tomorrow to get my permit. Very very unclear and waste of my time. Today, I had snow in my parking spot and when I called earlier, the lady told me to park at a nearby meter and I'll let the officer know you can park there, and then check back later and your parking spot should be clear of snow. Two hours later, I move my car from my meter to check if there is snow in my spot and I see that I have a ticket and the snow is still not removed. I call back and my luck has it the same African-American guy picks up (I recognize his voice). He says, well if you already moved your car that means you parked in your spot and are responsible for the snow. As I was trying to tell him I moved my car from the meter I was told to park at, he didn't get that and then he tells me ""Don't you raise your tone at me."" Seriously! The supervisor seemed to care, but just be aware that these people are rude. I wish our city administrators were as nice as the city itself.",1
Public Services & Government,"I would find this to be a good place to put down roots if events lead me back. I have found several livable neighborhoods; in fact I have not seen any that I would immediately avoid.
Climatically, weather extremes are not too bad. There is usually a week that seems to come in early January in which temperatures and winds make walking or bicycling unpleasant, and there are some high temperatures during the summer, but in general the area provides plenty of encouragement for engaging with the environment.
I have found government to provide services efficiently, with good concern for personal and property security for its residents. Local taxes are never too low, but citizens seem to me to get good return on their expenditures. Although the U of I is an important and large institution, I have not found its concerns to dominate unduly. The entertainment, educational, and recreational benefits of the University greatly outweigh any problems created.
The Public Schools struck me as pushing healthy aspirations, and seem to me to care about parent concerns and student welfare.
All in all, the city seemed to me to be a good place to live.",5
Local Flavor,"Pittsburgh, yay!  You are full of charm. (and I'm from Cleveland.)

But seriously, this city has some things down pat that my city does not. 

For example, the signs that are everywhere in front of buildings telling you what said buildings actually are. Or the signs that point you to specific neighborhoods. These signs are everywhere and they rock. Period. 

The best part has got to be their preservation of historic sites and old homes and buildings. Cleveland does NOT have this. Not even close. We raze everything! It's seriously depressing to go to Pittsburgh and see all of these beautiful, old buildings and think about how my city is in comparison. PGH seems to be overflowing with huge, historic homes, row houses, and old buildings in general... even if they were slightly falling apart they were still amazing to me. 

One thing I did not like, though.... EVERYTHING closes so early. Bars and restaurants closing at 9 is unheard of! 

Kudos to you PGH. From a visitors point-of-view, you are a mighty fine city.",4
Local Flavor,"Just passing though and hate the construction. Hate the drivers that are aggressive and mean. Is that all they do is honk the horn at everything?!!
I want to love this town, but I can't.",3
Local Flavor,"Although I live in Virginia Beach, I grew up in northern West Virginia about an hour from Pittsburgh. I think this is a very underrated city for several reasons. First, there are a lot of great restaurants in the city. Places like Primanti Brothers and Penn Avenue Fish Company are staples. 

Second, this is a great housing market. Almost everyone lives in the outskirts of Pittsburgh. The housing prices are considered to be below the national average. When the economy took a dive in 2008 and on Pittsburgh was the only area where house values went up. 

It's home to a great airport. Not only is it large with plenty of shops and restaurants inside, but it's easy to navigate and not usually slammed. I love flying here.

Finally, who wouldn't love spending an afternoon sitting at PNC Park watching a Pirates game? It's just relaxing and fun.",4
Local Flavor,"Pittsburgh rocks.  And I am saying that from a near-neighbor (Monroeville) viewpoint.

Entertainment venues are fabulous:  Benedum, Byham, Heinz Hall, Stage AE, Heinz Field, PNC Park, Consol (and many, many more) are all top-notch fun and --with the exception of Consol-- beautiful to look upon.  

Eateries:  Diverse and plentiful.  From the mostly blue collar of the Strip to the mostly white collar of Market Square you can enjoy everything from fresh ingredients to multi course meals.

Not having to park here every day for work, I can say that parking is a breeze - although on the pricey side at times.  And I must add that as a suburbanite the whole Mon Wharf flooding thing drops my jaw every time...

Sports are not my thing, but the 'Burgh surely has the teams - and they're pretty well loved by most and well-housed in their home city.

You're a boat person?  Pittsburgh has three rivers!  No boat?  Try the Clipper Fleet!  Zoo person?  Pittsburgh's is lovely and meandering!  Gambler?  Place your bets!  Flowers? Birds?  Phipps!  Aviary!  Architecture?  Look up, anywhere!  Incline?  Not one, two!  Fountain?  Massive!  Not feeling well?  Well, where do you think the whole UPMC/Highmark fight started - great place to be in medical need!  Airport:  International!  History?  Mellon, Carnegie, Frick!  Bus?  PAT! Mega!  Subway?  Um, sort of...  Major Universities?  Oh yeah!  Convention Center?  Quite large!  Art & Science?  Everywhere!  Hills?  MAKING THE BEST VIEW EVER!

Why not 5 stars?  Half star off because even though I never get lost going home (highway signage is wonderful), I usually get twisted getting there - there isn't any such thing as a ""block"".  Pittsburgh is a series of triangles and a lot of them are one way.  And the other half a star lost because of the word 'yinz'.",4
Local Flavor,"City of Champions, River City, City of bridges, Most Livable City.... Whatever you want to call it, Pittsburgh is a city on the move. 

Casting aside it's days as a smoky inferno, Pittsburgh shed its past, reinvented itself and is now strutting into the 21st century as a city to be looked up to by other rust belt cities. 

Once the steel Capitol of the world, today Pittsburgh prides itself as a leader in the fields of medicine, banking, robotics, health care and software. Home to many Fortune 500 and over 1600 start up companies, Pittsburgh has been called one of the best cities to start a company. 

Recently, Pittsburgh has been called a dining destination with farmland just outside the city limits, new restaurants are opening, taking advantage of fresh vegetables, dairy, and meats. 

Recently Pittsburgh hosted such world events as One Young World, the G20 Summit, major league baseball's All Star Game, NCAA's Frozen Four, AFC Championship games, and Stanley Cup Finals two years in a row. Since 1971 Pittsburgh Professional sports teams have won 11 world championships. Hence the title, City of Champions. 

Great town, good people, low crime, awesome theatre district, and museums.",4
Local Flavor,"I have had a love affair with Pittsburgh for as long as I can remember.  I am a native Pennsylvanian, but not a native Pittsburgher.  I suppose that means I am a transplant Pittsburgher.  Even though I am the latter, this city has been welcoming and very hospitable that no matter where I roam to, I end up back here.

I admit that when I first moved to the area I was that annoying driver that had no clue where he was going.  Not my fault I must say.  When the downtown is set up like a triangle and some of the streets turn into sidewalks or stairs, it can be confusing to a newbie.  I also admit that I had no clue where the neighborhoods began or ended.  With over 90 neighborhoods that comprise the city, it is hard to figure out what GetGo someone wants to meet at.

As time passed, I grew into Pittsburgh or maybe Pittsburgh grew in me.  From the way I dressed to the way I now talk, I have become a Pittsburgher.  You can call me a 'yinzer' if you like, but my response to you is going to require the word 'jagoff' in it.  A yinzer isn't anything bad to represent, it's like being a New Yorker, Philadelphian, or Bostonian.  They all have their unique way of living just as this area does.

Pittsburgh has grown and changed over the years, but for the better.  Pittsburgh is kind of like that annoying person you know that loves the limelight, but easily melds back into the crowd without missing a beat.  That person that can be gracious yet confident enough to own up to the achievements it has accomplished.

Here's to Pittsburgh, my home, and my home away from home.  As Willie Stargell said, ""I would always reserve a special place in my heart for Pittsburgh.""",5
Local Flavor,"Pittsburgh is an amazing city to live in. I'm a born and raised Pittsburgh girl and continue to live here. This seems biased, and a lot of people love their city, but I've visited other cities and none are like Pittsburgh. For one, our skyline is absolutely gorgeous! We have look outs up in Mt. Washington where you can view our whole city and the view is always breathtaking. Not only is our skyline one of the best skylines according to us today, we also have so much to do in Pittsburgh. You can always find something to do. We have our Carnegie museum, Pittsburgh zoo, Phipp's Conservatory, The Andy Warhol museum, point state park, etc. These are things you can do on a daily basis. During Christmas, is a great time as well because they have the ice skating rink opened at PPG Place with a huge Christmas tree planted in the middle, it's not only open around Christmas time, it's open from mid November-mid February. Market Square has a bunch of activities going on, you can see the Christmas lights get turned on, see the ""Kaufmanns"" windows which now take place at the Macy's, and see the Santa's from around the world at PPG place, etc. In the summer time, we have the art festival, boat regatta, you can see fireworks from an incredible view. There's always stuff to do regardless of the time of year and it's awesome! I love Pittsburgh!",5
Local Flavor,"My visuals of Pittsburgh come from Flashdance.  Suffice to say that's dated and not very realistic.  Modern Pittsburgh is a city with issues, but it's steadily improving.  The worst things about it are obvious - poor public transportation with widely spaced suburbs and not so great weather.

My comparison is going to definitely be against Portland, which for me was something of a disppointment after all the hype.  Pittsburgh on the other hand was a surprise, although it definitely resembles Portland - imagine more rivers, more bridges and lots more brickwork.  Also slightly fewer hipsters, and people were a little friendlier.  

I saw a good cross section of places, both suburban and downtown, and I think I must have driven past nearly every ""Gian' iggle' as well as visiting both Whole Foods. 

Beer-wise, it's not California for sure - the alcohol laws here are stupid to say the least, but there's still some great beer to be had from around the country, including nearby East Coast breweries.  And as for vegan options - that's still a novel idea here, but there are places to go.  

You should probably visit at least once.  And check out the dinosaurs.",4
Local Flavor,"Where's the summertime atttt yo?

while i was in Pittsburgh all i can think about was summer...summer can hurry up now, please & thank you!!!

it is extremely cold here during the winter... i was here the month of February...when the weather was below negative...How anyone enjoy this weather is beyond me...

city of Pittsburgh!

places i iv been while i was in Pittsburgh...
 
-Downtown Pittsburgh 

Compact and lively...Pittsburgh's downtown offers a big-city ambiance... Restaurants... shops(limited)... busy sidewalks...invigorating architecture...good public transport....and the occasional street fair... along with the riverfront...downtown was a great place to stay while i was here! I live on a busy street.. Window is closed and the sound of the city is putting me to sleep! so happy my hotel was located here! 

-North side 

A collection of neighborhoods that comprise nearly a third of the city...they are generically and perhaps unfairly referred to as the North side....Take a stroll in a unique urban park...visit the Andy Warhol Museum and the Mattress Factory Museum....walk towards downtown... just a short distance from downtown!

-Shady side 

If you're looking for weird homemade stuffs and hip restaurants...Shadyside is the place for you....Shadyside is pretty diverse...

-The Strip District 

It's no secret....the Strip might be the best thing about Pittsburgh....A lively produce market by day....a busy club scene at night...a visit to the strip is not to be missed during my stay here...and iv been here multiple times! A short walk from downtown as well...

-Mount Washington 

These are the views remembered when its below zero degrees... Ride up one of the city's historic inclines to go up and return trip is six bucks per person!",3
Local Flavor,"I fell in love with Pittsburgh with my first visit (**and this review is based solely on my 2 visits**).  

Cited as America's ""Most Livable City"", this former ""Steel City"" is now the latest hotspot for the food and tech industry.  Prices are affordable (heck I was able to eat at upscale restaurants at the same cost of eating at a casual/nice restaurant in NYC!)

The first time, I took the Megabus* here (8 hours) and got here pretty late.  The second time, I took the Amtrak (9 hours).  Most stores were closed when I arrived (8-9pm) but I felt somewhat safe walking through the Cultural District although there were some questionable people lingering by the bus stops or corners.  Nothing I don't see much in NYC.  Public buses run pretty frequently for $2.50 each ride (more if traveling past the first zone).

UPMC (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) is the largest employer in the area.  Their office building is part of the skyline.  Unlike NYC, the skyline is very well controlled and has a clean look.  The three rivers (Ohio, Allegheny, and Monongahela) converge at the iconic fountain at Point State Park.  PSP is more than just a park surrounded by water.  There are promenades and fresh green lawns all around.  Best of all, the view of Pittsburgh is beautiful from here, especially in the daytime/early evening.  For a nighttime view, I highly recommend the Dusquesne Incline across the river.  They have red cable cars going up and down the hill ($5 roundtrip) and operate until 12:45am on weeknights!  Oakland and Shadyside are also very nice.

Pittsburgh may be a small city but it has everything to keep an urban girl happy.  I loved the sweet and cozy feeling that warms my city heart as I walk down the streets or up the hills (reminds me of San Francisco).  I can definitely understand why Pittsburgh is ranked as America's most livable city and one of the 10 most unexpectedly romantic cities in the world (Forbes).  Driving around downtown is a pain though since Google Maps has some satellite issues.

Local Flavor,"It breaks my heart that Macy's no longer exists but I had to find some place to review the windows i had seen. The windows are now located on the Fifth Ave side of the building with one on Smithfield St. That window was very appropriate because it was themed after meet me under the clock which stood right next to it.

There was one window Macy's had used in the past. The others were decorated by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the Children's museum, and the Pittsburgh ballet. Each theme went with either an upcoming holiday production or one that would make the children excited like a Cirque production.

As I looked at them I cried inside thinking that this was all that was left of what was once our only remaining department store and that there were groups willing to lend a hand to make the holiday windows appealing. There was very little animation but that didn't matter to me The thought of seeing them brought joy to my heart because I always looked forward to seeing holiday windows as a child or when I happen to be in another major city during Christmastime.

I was glad for the chance to visit and take some pictures.",4
Local Flavor,"I remember moving to Pittsburgh in the summer of 2001 and thinking, ""what a dump"". And I was right. Downtown was not a place you'd want to be, and there was, smack dab in the middle of it. Nothing to do but go to CVS because everything else was going out of business, but the city has completely turned itself around.

I've live downtown, in Oakland and in Mt. Washington. In the 11 years in the city, I've seen so much growth and positive change. The smog covered city of the 1970's is now a culture hub for so many things. It's now a go-to city for amazing food. The city also boasts amazing museums, colleges and sports arenas. Oh, and we put french fries on pretty much everything. That may not be a plus for you, but it sure is for me!

Pittsburgh is not a New York City and never will be, but it doesn't claim to be either. It's the city where you lay down roots, have a family, but aren't bored to tears while you're there. The city of Pittsburgh holds so much to do for everyone who lives there. It's cheap to live: remember the ""most livable city"" win. 

If a person hasn't visited then they're really missing out. 

The city goes by many names: The burgh, the 412, Steeler Country, whatever nickname you bestow on the city, it'll always be just one thing for me- home.

And I may be biased when I say this, but this truly is the greatest city in the country.",5
Local Flavor,"The City of Pittsburgh, City of Champions, Steel City, Blitzburgh, The 'Burgh, Sixburgh.  The rivers, the mountains, the bridges, the views, the parks, the sports and sooo much more makes this an awesome city!  Bragging rights allows us to boast that we have more bridges than Venice, Italy.  Pgh is a smaller city, but has approximately 90 individual neighborhoods.  Like beer and pizza??  Pgh has 12 bars and 7 pizza parlors per every 10,000 residents, leading the country in bars and second in pizza.  
What I love about Pittsburgh are the many parks, both in city and surrounding county and state parks.  Our vast topography allows you to explore the city from many different aspects.  This past fall I took a river boat tour with my visiting family on the Gateway Clipper Fleet.  I had been on their boats in the past, but this was my first river tour with them.  I enjoyed it as well as my family did, but I've been on better boat tours in other cities.  I like the new modern pay stations replacing the old style parking meters.
What I kind of don't like is how we are becoming such a bike friendly town.  Have nothing against the people who like to navigate this way, but bike lanes and such are a pain with our already narrow city streets.  The rent-a-bike stations taking up parking spots are also annoying to me.  However, I do like the bike/walking trails, such as the Great Allegheny Passage that takes you from Pgh to Washington, DC.  
Being a native of this city, I'm proud of the changes I've seen growing up here.  We need to give thanks to former mayor Murphy who was instrumental in the early economic development that resulted in the modern Pgh we know today.  He brought us much needed new sports venues which has made the North Shore one of the best areas in the city.  Also, a new convention center and more.  Pgh went bankrupt because of these improvements, but it was well worth it!!
You gotta love our rich sports history.  The 5x World Series winning Pirates are arguably the hottest team in baseball right now with one of the best ball parks in the MLB.  The 3x Stanley Cup champion Penguins have the best arena in the NHL.  The 6x Superbowl champion Steelers repuation speaks for itself!!  Hopefully we will host SB57 here in our city.  To host a SB game, a city must have some 70,000 or so hotel rooms within an hour drive from the venue.  With so many new hotels being built around the city, let's hope our city gets that honor!!
Downtown is small and lacks a great shopping mall like other major cities. Some years ago, there wasn't much living downtown, now is home to many residents in the new apt complexes recently built or renovated from old buildings. Lots of new trendy places to eat around town. I dont gamble, but Rivers Casino is a cool place to visit. Amazing urban redevelopment happening around East Liberty and other areas.  No wonder why this city has topped the ""Most Livable"" list many times.  I can go on, but that's enough for now.  Hope you enjoy all this city has to offer!",4

It also reminds me of Cleveland before all the overnight foodies started regurgitating this whole local, CLE crap with 30 dollar t-shirts and 9.00 beer cocktails.  Its still a little gritty, walkable and has a wind range of types of cultures and people.  The bridges still confuse the hell out of me and I get lost every time but screw it.

Growing up as a kid, I remember it was a great adventure driving into the city with my family! I remember always going down to the strip district and shopping and eating food down there! 

After I started to drive, i was always down in Pittsburgh doing things! Mainly the under 21 clubs like a loser haha!! But after turning 21 Pittsburgh consumed my money, my time,and gained so much experience in life! At the age, all we carried about is to party!  It was the time of my life, and even still to this day I look back and laugh about all the memories!

This city has a strong based fan club for their hometown teams! This is a city of champions with football and hockey! Baseball, well that's coming around!   

Pittsburgh has a lot of great restaurants! Use Yelp to find to those places! You'll never have a problem finding places to eat for every budget...

Even worse is when you realize, ""HOLY shit, I don't have a birth certificate!""

So, you frantically search online and figure out that you need to get your birth certificate from Vital Records, but you sure as hell are not going to drive down there during the day when you work in Ahwatukee... we have all seen what downtown is like during the day... so you decide to order online...

Okay... I'm going to stop this ""hypothetical"" tale and get to the point... using the online system AZ Vital Records utilizes (Vital Check) was extremely easy, efficient, and when I just received my birth certificate only 3 business days later, I am jumping with joy and could quite possibly burst out of my clothing at any given second. I don't even mind that it cost me $36 (I think that is really reasonable being that it is evidence of my citizenship in this country)

""Martini Time"" is a live-audience cooking demonstration that is a lot more than just ""hey look at me cook up a steak.""  Chef Tina Martini imparts her many years and experience as a chef and nutritionist on the audience during the one-hour show.  She explains all of her ingredients, the health benefits of each and why they're an important part of a balanced diet.

She then shows off her culinary skills without skipping a beat on her presentation quality, which could easily fit in on Food Network.  The audience is fully involved and gets to eat the dish as they watch Tina put it together.  There's plenty of time for Q&A at the end.

Chef Tina is just getting started at M Resort and I was lucky enough to get a free pass the M Resort gave away via Twitter.  Tina does three shows a day, ranging in price from $40 to $60 dollars.  Sounds pricey, but keep in mind that also gets you a pass to the excellent M Resort buffet after the show with VIP seating.

And yes, Chef Tina Martini holds true to her name.  The show starts with a free martini called the M Fantasy which is super good.  You can even eat the flower garnish.  I only wish M Resort would have launched this show a couple months back when it was getting all kinds of publicity from hosting the latest Top Chef season.",4

Arts & Entertainment,"Rx for food? Using your food to prevent disease and obtain optimal health. I LOVE THIS SHOW! Chef Tina Martini not only provides an almost hour long cooking show but also gives tid bits about phytonutrients and how we can use food to protect our bodies from disease.

The show itself only costs $39.95 but also includes a VIP pass to Studio B Buffet after the show - no waiting in that hour long line! It is well worth the money spent. 

Helpful hints
1) Get in line early so you get first pick of your seats. Front row center is the best.
2) If you purchase your tickets at the M you do not have to wait in the huge line at Imagine rewards center - just step off to the right ( a solo computer) and someone will comeover to help you. I wish we knew this because we went on a rewards day and stood behind what seemed to be a million people waiting for their free tshirt! hahaha.
3)Keep the information and recipe cards she gives you. They are great!

I also loved how much she included the audience.You also get a free martini and samples of everything she prepared during the show. Very cool! After the show when we were in the buffet she even took the time to walk around and personally speak to everyone. I thought that was nice.

So what do you get when you mix a good price, a friendly, bubbly host and a free buffet? The Tina Martini Show....so go!",4

God dammit Phoenix, or Arizona for that matter, how the hell did you let THIS happen. 

Look at it for chirsts sake, it's disgusting.

So what happened here I'm not quite sure, but apparently to me it was sometime in the late 90's a couple of well off outsiders moved to town and bought up some land because it was so cheap. Problem is though, outsiders started bringing their friends and before you knew it home prices started SOARING out of control. 

I think it was best when I toured an open house that was selling for somewhere around 620.00 a square foot, then called the realtor out like this ""So, you're charging Newport Beach prices huh?""

He didn't like that.

""Scottsdale seems to be humorless in just about every way, but especially about its citizens collective dream of being Beverly Hills or Newport Beach East. You wonder how all of these Arizonians got their money with such a mediocre strip mall job market, or, if they don't actually have money but are very intent on pretending they do, you wonder how long it will last. With the Arizona housing market dropping off faster than any other state in the US you can deduce that a lot of people lost a lot of money.""  -The Economist 

But human nature is to hope and believe that things will always be as good as they are right now, and operate accordingly, so another round of JAGABOMBS!

Then the shopping came to town, which nobody could afford and if they did, just made them look like an idiot or, a clown dressed middle aged man....Affliction anyone??

Furthermore there's no pride in Scottsdale, just watch, Arizona has plenty of good sports teams that it's residents can root for, but in Scottsdale it's root for the Yankees or the Lakers, apparently because the city ""is at the same level"" as NYC or LA. 

New concepts come all the time, and they close all the time, it would be nice for these people to finally admit they can't afford all the fine things in life all the time and move on, instead of embarrassing themselves on the news with another store or concept closure. 

Figure it the fuck out Scottsdale, I'm tired of hearing about all your drama. 

And no, you can't have anymore California concepts, you lost that right after you couldn't figure out how to run an Oakville grocery, which is about as simple as feeding a dog bacon.",1
Public Services & Government,"I've only done this a couple of times. Breaking my rule of writing a review for a non-business.

I'm leaving the City of Scottsdale, but I figure it was a 4-Star experience.

This town get's a lot of guff from people who think it's ""too pretentious"". To those people, I say, get out and see the world a little. I've lived all over. Salt Lake, Los Angeles, Las Vegas. I've even spent the better part of the year traveling on business going from city to city, hotel to hotel.

Scottsdale has nice restaurants, a decent nightlife, great golf courses and an interesting mix of people: young professionals who just got their first real job, wealthy folks who enjoy life, seniors who are wondering why they are still alive. This place has it all.

The city is run like a well-oiled machine. The library system is very good. It's easy to pay your utilities. Construction can be a pain, but ends pretty quick. 

If you like sports, stick around for Spring baseball. The Giants, Diamondbacks and Rockies play here. 

Some people like to hit the poker table and, there are casinos nearby for that. If that's not your speed, hit the spa. Plenty of those to go around.

I'm glad I had a chance to experience the best of Scottsdale. If you are a visitor, stay in Old Town, but make sure you venture out to the north. There are some pretty cool things up there. Like Taliesin West.

Lastly, if you are looking to live here...it's not that expensive. You can buy a decent 3BR home for 150-200. At least right now. It might be tougher to sell it of course. But that's with any place.

Good luck.",4

But now  in our little gated  community the city has permitted a four story condo building - and I tell you folks the rooms do not have 7.5 foot ceilings.  I am sure that our home and those of our neighbors will help push the value of the condos up just as that much taller building blocking the views will push ours down.  Had we known that the Silverleaf developers could ""get to"" the city and avoid the restrictions it forced on us we would have built in San Diego.   There's a lesson here: Avoid investing in cities that have one set of rules and laws for the average person and a different set of rules and laws for the friends, cronies, and contributors of its politicians.",1
Public Services & Government,"From the first day, I treated her like no other.
I lovingly washed her.
Wheeled her outside twice a week.
And, when she fell, I was quick to pick her up and clean her off.
Then some miserable fuckstick of humanity stole her...right out from underneath me.

I called the City of Scottsdale and reported her missing. 
They said they would have a new garbage container out to me in two days.

I won't let this one out of my sight. 
Not ever again.

Five stars, Scottsdale.",5
Public Services & Government,"Scottsdale Municipal Services truly suck the big one and swallow. We never received a water bill in August. Today, 9/5/14, we received a bill showing a past due amount ""due IMMEDIATELY"" and a $5 late fee for a bill we never received. I called Water Services and was directed to ""Revenue Recovery"" as if I'm some sort of deadbeat. I explained my problem and the woman on the other end became terse, rude and downright nasty. ""Well, we use the same mail everyone else uses so it's not our responsibility if you don't get your bill."" So I'm supposed to drive to where they print their bills and pull mine off the line? Is that it? 

The conversation got worse as I tried to explain that it's unfair to penalize me for a bill I never got. ""Well, you can have it taken out of your checking account (for a fee)"" Oh, like I'm going to trust this slimy bunch of perverts with my bank account and routing numbers. Like hell I will. 

The end result is that I can take a full day of my time to file a formal protest which will go before a board of review to see if they can waive the $5 ""late fee"". I know their time isn't worth anything but mine is. I guess they are really telling me that need to steal a plant from the park to get my $5 back. 

There were a lot of ways the city could have handled this communication which would not have angered or antagonized me but the PMS Queen chose to speak in condescending tones and tell me it's my responsibility to police the US Postal Service. So I overpaid by a penny just so they have to post it as a credit. Next month, another penny and so on until I have my $5 back in manual processing time.",1

The Phoenix area seems pretty nicely well planed in regards the street systems, although Borderline Ave has some intersections that will make you think your in the wrong lane because the turn signal is in the lane that is going straight, so that has thrown me off several times, who knows maybe they thought it would be funny to do that to people that dont live here?

Public Services & Government,I felt the place was tiny but clean. But the man who worked there was rude. I was returning one of the books and he was stating that because i got a little rain on the pages i would have to buy a whole new book for them? And the price he wanted was outrageous. I would never pay such a price for a book. I never went back. Nor did I buy a book for them either. Especially when I moved out here and donated like twenty or so to them. Next time I donated some books. I took them to the salvation army instead.,1

Public Services & Government,"I never knew this library existed until I ventured here to pick up a book for the Yelp book club. Out of all the libraries in the valley, only two were carrying 'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks'. The Alexander library was closest to home so coming here was a no brainer (I wasn't about to drive 45 minutes to a library on Sahara!). The major crossroads for this branch are Craig and MLK. I called ahead to place a hold on the book, and an older gentleman gave me peace of mind by setting it aside for me at the circulation desk. Upon arrival, I realized the Alexander library has an almost identical layout to the Deer Springs library. It's a no frills library of smallish size, but it gets the job done.

They children's section is small is well-kept and tidy but does not have any of the frills that my littles look forward too. There is a park outside and my kids enjoyed that.

If you have curious tots or clumsy kids, do not let them run ahead! The landscaping is mostly thorny cacti, especially between the library and park, that are just waiting to ruin your weekend.",4

It would have been nice to have been informed of this prior to getting a number and sitting amongst a bunch of sick coughing people for close to two hours!

I can not get that time back, it was a miserable wait and there is nothing stated anywhere that this location does not handle any social security card related issues. Who knew that only certain Social Security offices do and don't?

Lame Lame Lame.

I told my boyfriend from the start we should have gone to the Buffalo location from the beginning but he had something on this side of town to do so he wanted to stop at this one! Ha Ha I told you so babe!

Lesson learned... Always trust your gut instinct we are born with it for a reason!!!

The Irony of this story is that I live really close to the Buffalo/Charleston office location so this was really a waste of time today.",1

Local Flavor,"One of my favorite Food & Music Events here in Las Vegas!!! Small but full of energy and lots of great food!!! 

Located in Downtown Las Vegas at the Fremont Experience this annual event celebrates black history month with 3 days of food,music and FUN!!! 

Live entertainment from local artists and more,plus bbq,soul food and lots of sweets from about 20 merchants all set up in booths directly across from the 3rd street stage. 

For the most part it was exactly the same food vendors as last year with just a few new ones. My favorite John Mulls Meats Road Kill Grill was there and I was excited to visit them again since they only make this 1 appearance a year and they have FANTASTIC barbecue!! Just as I remember DYNAMITE!!!(see review below) 

There were lots of food options from BBQ Turkey Legs,Chicken,Ribs,Links,Brisket,Pork plus Cajun Seafood and Catfish, Funnel Cakes, Slices of Cake, Candied,Carmel and Chocolate Apples plus lots more to choose from!! The prices are pretty reasonable for a Las Vegas event most meals were under $10!!!",5
Local Flavor,"Some of the most fun I've had in LV in a long time. 

Very street....and very good. 

Go down now! It's the last day!

Great bbq....and delicious sides. Take it home, or be prepared to eat standing up at tables that are the size of silver dollar, while homeless guys watch you chow-down from afar. If you don't finish, give what's left to them.

Some good music: real soul and jazz.
Some bad music: boring hip-hop.

And while you're there, go to The Beef Jerky Store which is right there. Get some dried mangoes...it'll help digest the ribs.",5
Local Flavor,"We have been coming to this festival for the last few years.  This year they expanded the festival to 3 days (fri-sun).  It is a small festival but always has some great vendors.  Usually BBQ, catfish, Cajun, seafood, jerk chicken, southern, desserts and a few food trucks.  This year we went on Sun and there weren't very many vendors, not sure if it was because it was the last day or there were just less this year.  We went almost 2 hours after the festival opened and most of the vendors were still not open.  Most were still cooking and a few were just setting up as we were leaving.  That was disappointing.  The food we did get was good.  I wish they would put up at least a few tables to sit or even stand at, there were none.  There were also no trash cans except what a few vendors had put out.  I will be back next year but will go later in the day when hopefully there is more choices.",4
Local Flavor,"Welp, we went on a wet cold rainy day!  So with that being said!  No fault of the event, but I just really wanted to go home!  We did, have a few drinks on a patio, and we did, get some hotdogs, from a vendor that was offering some special!  He was probably trying to get rid of them, since it was the last day, and it was wet rainy and cold!  But he was offering 2 for $5.00 and they were fully loaded, and they were so good! Then I decided to run over to the funnel cake truck, and I got the carmel one!  OMG, OMG it was amazing! After we gobbled up the funnel cake we had to go, it was too cold!  There aren't nearly as many vendors as it use to be in the past!  I know there charging them an arm and a leg to have a booth out there.  Maybe if the head honcho lowers the price a bit, they will have more vendors!  IJS But I will always go to at least 1 day during this event!  It's good to have so many vendors in 1 spot!",4
Public Services & Government,"I'm shocked the Melrose District has yet to be reviewed. Anyone who passes through Phoenix should visit this little eclectic haven. It's one of my favorite areas in the Valley. 

If I'm ever looking for something unique and off the beaten path, I immediately visit the Melrose District. Full of vintage clothing stores, antique stores, boutiques and restaurants, it's a great way to shop and eat the way through a lazy weekend day. 

When traveling through the Melrose District, I find the best antiques (reasonably priced too!), great vintage clothing if I'm in need of a costume or classic piece, boutiques where I find great gifts for friends and family (shh, that's my secret!) and I can stop and grab a bite either at a neighborhood grocery store or restaurant along the way. I've noticed several stores that I haven't had the chance to visit yet (like the 'wash your own pet' store) so as soon as the weather becomes nice again, I'll be making it a day on Melrose!

The Melrose District does a great job of preserving Arizona history. With the gorgeous homes off the main strip, you can easily park your car and take a stroll up and down the streets. But beware, if you blink you might drive through the Melrose District without even realizing you drove through! It's an area that looks misleading to the common eye, but once you really look, you realize that you are surrounded by gems of the city. 

In addition to the daily services, when the weather's nice, the businesses on Melrose participate in a street festival where visitors can walk up and down the district and browse the shops. I'm counting down the days until the next one! So when you have some down time on your hands, take a drive to 7th and explore the district you've been missing all along!",5
Public Services & Government,Vintage heaven.  I love spending the whole day going shop to shop finding unique items for my house or wardrobe. This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix.,5
Public Services & Government,"I love this part of town!!!  Thanks for cleaning it up!!!  Welcome to the ""gayborhood""",5
Public Services & Government,"A couple of monkeys from the zoo could provide better customer service and water supply than the folks at Johnson Utilities.  A check for payment of the current water bill was mailed Friday February 11 had not yet cleared the bank. A letter was received February 23 in the mail indicating payment had not been made, a $1.32 late penalty applied and a disconnect notice for a bill that was due on the 15th. 

I don't know if it is a one person operation, but it is very difficult to reach anyone on the phone. Calling usually results in a busy signal. They are only open from 8am - 4:45 and they take an hour for lunch (shutting off the phones). When I finally reached someone they indicated the check was not received and they would accept payment over the phone. They do not accept American Express, so I provided a Visa. The amount of the missing check was paid over the phone and the charge processed February 22. Naturally, the missing check was located and also cashed on February 23. Today I receive a statement dated February 28 (which has yet to occur), stamped February 24 showing that the funds from neither the 22nd nor 23rd have been applied. Of course calling in resulted in busy signals followed by a message indicating they were now closed until Monday. 

Another thing that appears to be fishy is the minimum charge. The bill includes the statement ""water minimum $27"". It shows the actual water usage was $6.25 - to me, and I think most normal places, it means that $27 is the magic number - if you exceed $27 in charges, you are billed that amount. If you do not, you are charged the minimum $27. Not at Johnson Utilities - the new math for these folks is the minimum plus the usage. 

This operation is a waste of office space. Help the local economy and hire some folks to answer the phone and address customer questions. You might want to hire someone in accounting to process payments timely, someone in the mailroom to not lose the mail and an office manager who can oversee the efficiency of the office.",1
Public Services & Government,"I am SOOOOO fed up with these people!!!  Every time I call them they tell me something different about my balance. They treat their customers very rudely.  They talk down to me.  Sewer charges come to about $35. If you are even ONE day late they charge a $40 (yes FORTY dollar!) late fee!    I call in my payments to make sure they get there on time and they still somehow lose them. Somehow that's MY fault! And they charge me through the teeth for it too! 

My biggest complaint is that I have no recourse. There's no way to hold them accountable for their actions. It's not like I can just opt out and go with another company for my service. You know, someone reasonable.  I HAVE to use them and they know it.",1
Public Services & Government,"If I would've known they were this bad, I would have moved somewhere else. Every employee gives a different answer to your question. Do NOT pay by check. They will lose it or somehow it won't get processed and you'll still get shut off AND they'll rack up fees on top of it. They have lost payments IN THE DROP BOX. Credit card payments take up to 3 business days to post/process. The ONLY way to make a payment and have it posted that day is to walk in and hand the CASH to the lady. Keep your receipt. 

They claim to give a courtesy call to remind you of your due bill but then you don't get a call. I never have. Another lady said it's automated. Still another lady said they're not responsible for faulty automated system. I doubt it even exists. 

I believe this is our local equivalent to big banks who make their money on fees. The majority of their business is from late fees, reconnection fees, etc. If you're considering moving to their service area, move somewhere else. This company has the monopoly in the area and they know it.",1
Public Services & Government,"Johnson Utilities customer service is so terrible that some people actually cite it as a reason for moving away! Over the past several years they've had multiple incidents of customer complaints, some leading to public protests. They employ SLAPP tactics to aggressively discourage customers from speaking out. Recently, a Johnson Utilities spokesperson commented regarding the notification of a potential E. Coli contamination ""The company said they didn't have enough time to go door to door and didn't send out an email to customers because not enough people have computers."" In 2012 not enough people have computers? what about smart phones? The reality is that the company owners are completely out of touch with their customers and don't care since they're the only choice in town.",1
Public Services & Government,"If there was an option for less then one star that's what this terrible excuse of a company is, no bill sent water was shut off paid the bill plus $50 reconnect fee, yes it costs them $50 in fuel to drive 4.3 miles to my house, have been without water for 3 days now. The bill was paid three days ago and cleared and still no water,  they promise us they would be out in an hour after the bill was paid. Yeah that was three days ago.. Hate hate hate Johnson Utilities if the people there hate their jobs then they need to find new ones.",1
Public Services & Government,"It's been paid since Wednesday here it is almost a week later I still have no water!! They keep applying my payments to an incorrect account. They aren't even looking at my account number! What's the point of having an account number if they're aren't going to look at it? Now I'm being told that if anything happens to the walk that's on my meet her, that they're going to call the police and remove my meter even with a paid bill I still don't have water! Then being pretty much strong-armed by somebody by the name of Stephanie at their office I don't even dare to go in there anymore she is  6 feet tall and a big girl. Is this even legal? Since when did utility companies get to decide who they get to supply too even if the bill is paid? And then tell me that they're going to remove my meter and I will never have water in my house are you crazy? Stephanie needs to be fired from her job as she has no people skills and also wants to do is literally throw her weight around. Johnson utilities is a joke of a company and the joke of the business. I can't wait for them to go down.",1
Public Services & Government,"I really wish I could give ZERO stars to this poor excuse for a utility company.  A.  Why do I pay almost 200.00 a month for WATER/SEWER!?!?!??!  I don't have a pool.. and as we all know this is AZ I have barely any grass.   We need to get this company OUT of our neighborhood before we are all broke, dirty, and thirsty.  B.  The customer service is terrible! They are rude, when we moved into our home I didn't have the money for the deposit and I asked the guy ""So since I don't have a ton of money my family will just not be able to shower and use the restroom?""  and he said, ""no because your not able to pay the deposit you won't have water""  REALLY!?!?!   They don't care about anyone's situation at all.",1
Public Services & Government,"Sure the rates are high, and the hold times can be long, but I have never had an issue getting a minor (or even a major) problem resolved within a couple of minutes of talking to someone.",2
Public Services & Government,"I addition to foul smelling water, the cost of the water is exorbitant! I've never had to pay this much. As others have said, the customer service is severely lacking, and for such a small office, their concern for the well-being of the neighborhood they serve is non-existent. So you are having trouble with your bill? Well how about we charge you the cost of the bill, a reconnect fee, and a deposit instead? Makes total sense right? To financially penalize someone who couldn't afford the bill in the first place? Thumbs Up, Johnson Utilities!",1
Public Services & Government,I am so upset to come home and find out that our water is turned off. I have been a customer of Johnson Ranch Utilities for 7 yrs. I have never been shut off and have even been refunded our deposit because of our good history with paying our bill on time. I never received a disconnection notice. Our bill in not over the 30 day past due limit. Is it even legal to cut someone's water off if their bill is more that 10 days passed due??,1
Public Services & Government,"Most horrible customer service representative EVER - Giovanna. She was unbelievably rude from the beginning of our conversation today and yelled at me throughout, finally hanging up on me when I was trying to find out if I had paid them all that was needed at that time. I have never been treated anywhere near that terribly by a customer service rep from any company and hope I never come close again. I hate that I have no choice but to use this company. They don't care about customer service because they don't have to, as we have no alternatives for water, sewer and trash where I live.",1
Public Services & Government,"I would select no stars if possible. This has got to be the worst company I've ever dealt with. Had my water shut off for an alleged non-payment. Only problem is, the bank processed the money and they collected it. Then they wanted to hit me with a $50 re-connect fee. Complete joke!!!!",1
Public Services & Government,"Just restating the obvious that Johnson utilities clearly takes the trophy for worst customer service and wins the metal of dishonor for their complete lack of ethics and professionalism! Too bad this area hasn't incorporated and we could all finally get rid of Johnson utilities! It's a shame that the thousands of residents of Queen Creek and San Tan Valley do not have any other option than to tolerate the over priced, tyrannical services of Johnson utilities! This company has been allowed to walk all over its customers for way too long and they know they can without these cities incorporating!!! Rude employees (Giovanna especially) high prices, and extra fees should be the new motto of this company! My family has had the displeasure of utilizing Johnson utilities for well over ten years, and were just recently treated to our water being disconnected because of a billing error made by Johnson utilities..... Wow!!! They even punish their customers for their own pathetic mistakes!! Supposedly this company is trying to revamp their public image after the recent E. coli scare in the water and raw sewage spill into the water..... But again it is only when people are watching that they behave and properly do their jobs!! Johnson utilities should be ashamed of their business practices and focus on doing what is right and expected Of a public utility company....... Servicing their customers professionally, ethically, and safely! Maybe if we all had a choice to use a different utility company,  Johnson utilities would finally see just how bad they are after we all left!!! Shame on Johnson Utilities for taking advantage of their customers!!",1
Public Services & Government,"We just moved into the area and are coming from paying around $20/mo for water and $12/mo for sewer...

Now, with this company (monopolized the area and apparently passes their profit taxes to their customers' bills), we pay $33 for water, which is fine, but a whopping $44 for sewer service?! AND we get the CAGRD fee as well?!

We're now paying around $90/mo for water services. Absolutely ridiculous.

We moved out here because of the affordability of housing. Now, I can't wait to sell this house and start renting again in the Phoenix suburbs. Johnson Utilities isn't the only company raking people over the coals :cough: fire department :cough:",1
Public Services & Government,"Wow, other folks really hate this company. 

I have lived in the area for 6-7 years now with automatic payments. I have never had an issue with payment. Whenever I call and ask a question, they answer it. 

I really don't have any problems with this company. They offer clean, drinkable water (as far as I know). Their customer service is average, but the water and sewage cost is a bit high. Overall, I would say they are an average utility provider.",3
Public Services & Government,I have been paying late fees the last few years off and on because I get their e-notification after the due date. Changing to regular mail didn't help either. Now I pay 1 month ahead to avoid their late fees. They are the only utility company that tries to Nickle and dime their customers with late fees. Clean I up your finance department JU.  Their water pressure is also very high. I had to install a water reducing valve to prevent broken irrigation pipes.,1
Public Services & Government,"Don't deal with Johnson Utilities, they are the rudest and ignorant bunch of people. The fees are a joke compared to other companies, they disconnect your service with out telling you. We were a couple days late, not even 5 days, and they put a plug in our sewer tank with out telling us. Our sewer backed up in the house in all the bathrooms and was all over the tubs, showers, floors, it was a mess. I had to pay for a plumber to come out at midnight, they were able to take the plug out. When I called Johnson Utilities in the morning to ask if they put something in my septic tank, they laughed and said yes, and they can do anything they want. And the this came from the manager, who denies any of his employees are rude. He said all his employees are very nice and helpful and that it's me. I couldn't believe it. I told him he better read the reviews about his company.
Bottom line, don't get service from this company if you don't have to. Save yourself the headache and trouble.
One star is WAY to many!",1
Public Services & Government,"I'm not quite sure why others have such a terrible experience with JU. I've been here for a year now and have never had an issue with JU. The water is a little questionable at times (not often) but their customer service is amazing.

I've had to pay my bill late twice and they have always been helpful in setting up a payment extension for me. Today, I was due to be disconnected if I didn't make arrangements. I called them and it kept ringing busy so I messaged them on Facebook, and within an hour someone called me and helped me to give me an extension so that my water wasn't shut off. This is what I call great customer service.

So far, so good.",5
Public Services & Government,"Honestly, had I done more research on Johnson Utilities before buying our house, I would have never bought out here. They are the biggest hassle. We have received multiple disconnect notices, after paying our bill. We have tried for days to contact someone through phone and spend 45+ minutes on hold multiple times throughout the day. We have called to have nothing but a busy signal, never to talk to a human being. This is the same story every single month. San Tan Valley needs a new water company. This company has no regard for their customers. Shame on Johnson Utilities.",1
Public Services & Government,Awful water quality it stinks I'm sure all thease people have noticed the sewer smell when doing laundry I hate having to shower in this water its not clean at all nitrates at were tested at163 ppm that's to high can't wait till were incorporated in Stv,1
Public Services & Government,"The water is horrific. Water pressure is awful. Tastes and smells awful. I wish my husband and I bought a home elsewhere. I've told everyone I know about JU and will continue to do so until the first thought that pops into everyone's mind when they hear ""San Tan Valley"" is bad water and the nightmare we call Johnson Utilities.",1
Local Flavor,"We would have loved to experience this first annual Chandler BBQ event... however due to some piss poor planning we and hundreds of other people were left out in the cold (or should I say hot). 

See... this event was supposed to go from 10am-9pm on Saturday, but by 1:30pm when we arrived they announced via megaphone that no more tickets were being sold and they were apparently ""out of meat"". Please tell me how an event which is supposed to go all day until 9pm blows it load just three hours into the festivities? 

To make matters worse, when we were turned away they explained that they'd be re-opening ticket sales at 4pm and more food would be available. So we planned our whole afternoon around this, and wasted time until 4. When we arrived for our second attempt of the day, to our shigrin they changed their minds yet again and reneged on what they had said earlier. Now... tickets were on sale for five bucks... but there was no BBQ!!!! No BBQ at a BBQ Fest... ex-fucking-scuse me? Basically five bucks to walk around and stare at a bunch of empty BBQ reminants... it just didn't make much sense.

So many people drove across town to come here (including us) and I really hope next time they put some more time into the planning of this event... it has promise. Hopefully we'll be able to return next year and actually be able to review the food... and not the ill planned event itself. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.",1
Local Flavor,"I'm sorry you guys had to deal with that!  My husband and I were competitors at the event and we had no idea what was going on logistically until later in the day when people started telling us about it.  Unfortunately, we ran out of food as well around 3pm after having started serving at about 11am.  I know that doesn't sound long, but we went non-stop and always had a line, just like many of the other competitors.  I know how you feel about the small sample sizes too, but I'm sure many were just trying to make them last as long as they could.  I always try to serve good size portions because I know that you spend a lot of money on them.  

This was a first year event and they are accepting feedback so that next year's event will be even better for all of those involved, including those wanting to taste BBQ!!  

I know that our team will be out at Scottsdale in 2 weeks and will be serving samples until we run out, which is actually a lot of food.  My advice is come early and come hungry, you won't be disappointed!",5
Local Flavor,"Hopefully, the organizers get their act together and limit the crowd before the competitors run out of food.
We got there around 2:00, got in line and waited about 20 minutes when a staffer comes out with a bullhorn telling everyone that they're not selling anymore tickets until 4 pm because they ran out of food.  
Unfortunately, the organizers didn't anticipate such a turnout.  I was so looking forward to this event since I was in town for spring training.  Anyway, hopefully next year will be better.",1
Local Flavor,"Bruntsfield is one of Edinbrugh's best kept secrets.

It's a relatively large area in the centre/East of Edinburgh. It is a mere 15 minute walk from Princes Street, and is a haven of small shops, cute cafe's and is home to the wonderful meadows. The main street in Bruntsfield is Bruntsfield place, and it is the only street with any sort of liveliness. i quite like this, as everything you would like to see is laid out infront of you. The cheese shop is renowned throughout Edinburgh, and the family butchers is one of the few places still run by a family. Whether you want exotic jewelry, 'posh' chocolate, a coffee, an outfit for your brothers baby or a cricket bat, Bruntsfield is the place to be.
I've lived in Edinburgh for 4 years now, and if ever I need something, I would always go to Bruntsfield. For one thing, you can always get a parking space, and the people are so friendly and welcoming I never want to leave. Bruntsfield is at the end of the Meadows in Edinburgh, a well-known and well-loved huuge area of green grass, green trees and great people. It's standard practice in Edinburgh to sit on the meadows or play a game of mini-golf and stroll up to Bruntsfield.
On top of this, there are a few celebrities (and I'm talking good celebrities, proper A-listers, not just Big Brother rejects) who live in Bruntsfield and the surrounding area, so you could well be sitting next to someone famous sipping your espresso admiring your new shoes. 
You can walk down Bruntsfield in your best Karen Millen dress or in your slouchy-trousers without getting a second glance. It's just a really cool place, similar to Notting Hill in London. 10/10!",5
Local Flavor,"Whenever I walk up to Bruntsfield I always leave feeling jealous of all my friends who live up here. I feel I made a mistake living in the dingy, dull Dalry.

Bruntsfield is brimming with beautiful little shops selling gorgeous little gifts for you to spend all your pennies on. There is also a wonderful selection of cafes and high quality food stores to cater for every taste. They have not one, but two chocolate shops! Not fair- share with the rest of Edinburgh! There is clothes shops, sporting shops and card shops. Really every shop you could possibly need for just about anything. The Meadows are on the doorstep so you grab some food at Peckhams and have a picnic. Bruntsfield is great for an afternoon of just milling around and having all your needs satisfied by awesome quality, small businesses.  

I so wish I lived here!",5
Local Flavor,"I definitely want to live here when I graduate. It's like a prettier, more stylish and grown-up version of it's next door neighbour, Marchmont.

Think beautiful old buildings, more cafés/boutiques/gift shops/jewellers than you could ever get bored of, and your halfway there. Throw in some basic essentials like the mini Waitrose and Tesco Metro, a handful of pubs, good bus links to the city centre (which is 10 minutes away) and you've got it all.

Most of the shops etc are on Brunstfield Place, the main road running through the area. There's the biggest branch in the Peckhams chain, the original member of the Montpeliers family, and my personal favourites... The Chocolate Tree and Luca, both of which will sort you right out when you need your next chocolate and caffeine fix.

The big, grassy Brunstfield Links are great too, ideal for lounging on in the summer which a picnic, or when you're too full from working your way through the various pizzerias' and cafés' menus. 

Because it's such a gorgeous and trendy area, prices in Brunstfield are slightly higher than the neighbouring Tollcross or Marchmont, but it's such a gorgeous place that you really don't mind.",4
Local Flavor,"Bruntsfield gives you a tantalising taste of the high life when you visit. With old, airy buildings with turrets on top, acres of green grass and miles of suburbia, it takes you one step out of the city even though it's only half an hour away from the centre!

As the ladies have pointed out, there are some gorgeous shops out here. From the lovely Peckhams to fancy chocolatiers, there is enough for you to pamper yourself in style. Speaking of style, they also have a number of lovely indepenent boutiques and toy shops catering to all ages. If you dig deep enough, you can also find a couple of vintage and curiosity shops. 

After a hard day's shopping you will be hungry, and there are no shortage of delightful restuarants and bars up this end of town. Trendy without being too ostentatious, you can hope to find anything from traditional fayre to culinery delights and critic's choices.

It's a very family friendly area and if I had the money, the kind of place I would want to bring up my kids. It is an absolute treat!",4
Local Flavor,"If any where in this city was to encapsulate the cool, artsy and academic cafe culture of Edinburgh's students and young professionals, it's Bruntsfield.

At the far west end of the Meadows and surrounding areas, this little slice of culture houses more cafe's, shops, pubs and even a Waitrose's than you could shake a stick at. I walk around this area of town and envy those who can stay here.

Inncidently, I'm looking for a new flat for next year, and Bruntsfield is one of the area's I'm looking at. I will update my review with any further reviews etc later on.",5
Local Flavor,"Every time I go here, I can't help but love it.",5
Local Flavor,"Ah, the start of the road to one of the most affluent bits of Edinburgh, well apparently, because once you get to Morningside, which is just up from Bruntsfield, you've apparently got the highest number of hidden millionaires in the UK on your radar.

Perhaps hanging around Bruntsfield in all the varied and attractive shops, restaurants, and bars, will up your chances of locating a millionaire, to do with what you will. But I suppose if they're hidden...how will you know? I find it's usually something subtle like a top hat or a monocle that gives the game away.

Anyway, I don't generally come here millionaire hunting, I'm more partial to a bit of the greenery, cute and unique boutiques, delis (Peckhams, to be precise) and good quality cafes in the area. Well worth venturing out of the city centre for a browse here.",4
Local Flavor,"When I think of Bruntsfield, I think The Chocolate Tree, Le Mouton Noir, Artisan Roast, Rose Brown. I think of very high quality, unique hand-made delicious goodies like hot chocolate with churros, of French fine dining, of the best latte in town.

Sadly, Le Mouton Noir has shut down. But in its place The Two Birds, I am told, serves very lovely food.

And there's a lot more of that in Bruntsfield. The neighbourhood of cafés, with a few restaurants dotted around, and one bar (only one?) for good measure.

To be honest, I only know Bruntsfield as Bruntsfield road. Stretching from the top of the Meadows, to Holy Corner (does it become Morningside around then I think?) I've been told there are around 52 cafés stretching out in Bruntsfield. 52. So you'll never be short of a cup of a place to get a cup of coffee.

There are also some lovely little boutique shops great for buying gifts: Clementine, amongst others. There is also one of my favourite independent jewellery stores: Rosie Brown. I bought myself a bracelet from here as a 'well done' gift and I haven't taken it off since. It's like Edinburgh's own, and nicer, Links of London (if I may be so bold).

I wander up to Bruntsfield when I want a nice café to read a book, meet a friend or take a leisurely, but fairly short stroll. It also rarely attracts tourists, as it's on the other side of the Meadows from the University and Royal Mile, on the far right corner up a wee hill. I'd encourage tourists to head up this way to find some very unique wee cafés like The Chocolate Tree and Artisan Roast. It's an idyllic wee neighbourhood and whilst anyone who lives there does often bemoan the lack of bars and nightlife, that could perhaps be why it's so idyllic?",4
Local Flavor,"Brunstfield is a lovely neighbourhood on the edge of the city centre.  With the Links Park next door, a pletora of coffeehouses and independent shops, Brunstfield has much to offer.  You will enjoy a French breakfast at la Barantine, hot chocolate and cakes at the Chocolate Tree, lovely coffee at Artisan Roast and Project, German patisseries from the Kondi Meister, or a healthy smoothie from Juice up.  There are also plenty of small fashion shops (not cheap) and others.  Oh and of course, winemongers if you happen to be barbecuing on the Links, on one of the few summer days Scotland has!",4
Local Flavor,"I think any neighbourhood where you can find an artisan cupcake spot and a store dedicated to cheesecake within three doors of each other deserves a nod. 

I'll be honest - I haven't spent a lot of time in Bruntsfield being that I call Stockbridge home and it's a 45 minute walk uphill. But I have found myself poking along Bruntsfield Road as of late and it's pretty darn cute. As many have said before me, it's a mecca for little cafes and artsy knickknacks. 

If Bruntsfield was a person, it would be your quirky neighbour who turns vintage watering cans and spray painted old boots into flower pots, is particular about their coffee and hand makes decorative bunting for parties - parties where the glasses offered are mason jars and you find yourself nibbling on mid priced cheese and gluten free crackers. I more or less like this person... just as I more or less like Bruntsfield. 

Look, any neighbourhood that is within striking distance of the Meadows, where you can pick up a great coffee and a cupcake on your way to stretching out on the grass is a fine neighbourhood indeed.",4
Local Flavor,"This is one of my favourite spots in Edinburgh. There are loads of boutique shops and cafes. Be sure to check out Cuckoo's Bakery, Artisan Cheesecake or Choclate Tree for something sweet. If you're on the hunt for caffeine, stop by Artisan Roast or Rosevear Tea. Or if you're looking for both, then how about Falko or La Barantine? If you're in the mood for drinks, then Montpeliers might be your place. There is also Bruntsfield Links, the nearby park. This is a perfect stop if you have kids or want to walk the dog or just want to enjoy your coffee and cupcake.",5
Local Flavor,"Wow, the first review of this was particularly scathing.  I have been here a number of times in my adult life and have enjoyed each one.  Fair enough, there's nothing really to do there apart from walk out and walk back, but what do you expect!  It's an island!  On that note, it's always worth checking the tide times before you do head across, as there would be nothing worse than having to call the coastguard out.  It is a fair walk across, along a path that is not of great quality, but this should be expected with the amount of time that it is probably submerged!

On a sunny day, this is a great place to go, and gives you a good view out into the Forth and across to Fife and beyond.  I have also been on a foggy day, when it is not as nice.  But then that's Scotland for you!  It's completely free to visit, and well worth the walk out in my opinion.",3
Local Flavor,"Cramond as a wee village/neighborhood is beautiful.  It has a beach, a pub, a river, and woodland walks.  It also has Cramond Island.

I think Cramond Island is pretty cool, but then I love walking/hiking exploring abandoned buildings/ruins.  You can reach the island on a walkway that's only exposed during low tide.  Fortunately the coast guard (probably tired of having to pick folk up who got trapped) has posted times when the ""island"" is accessible. 

In my opinion it's definitely worth a bit of exploring on a sunny afternoon, as long as you keep an eye on the time!",4
Local Flavor,"Cramond is a great place to go if you want to forget that you live in the city. We are pretty spoilt by such delights though in Edinburgh: arthur's seat, the meadows, salisbury crags, princes street gardens etc... 

Sometimes it's nice to get close to a great body of water though. It always seem as though there should be a great impressive river between the royal mile and Princes street; instead there is a massive train track. This is not a terrible thing, but coming from a small seaside town, sometimes I miss water. Portabello and Cramond fill this void. 

I have yet to go to Portabello, though I have been to Cramond a couple of times, and it  is an incredibly attractive little village when the sun comes out. The island with the disappearing walk way offers a thrill. Don't get stuck there, read the tide times. There are no shops or amenities there, so you'd likely be hungry, lonely and cold for a couple of hours... 

The walkway provides a pretty walk, one can see the fife and several buildings along the bank. Once on the island, you can take a walk around, enjoy the quiet and tranquillity, hopefully avoid getting blown away by wind, and potentially see dolphins and porpoises if you wait patiently. Don't wait too patiently, or as already mentioned, you will get temporarily marooned. 

This is a great destination for a Sunday day out with friends, for a couple, or the family. It is also well linked to Edinburgh by the 41 bus.",4
Local Flavor,"Walk off the mainland...
Do not get caught by the tides...
Wonderful wildlife!",4
Local Flavor,"First time I got there, walkway was under the water. Plan your trip!

Second time it was raining all morning...  I was cold and wet and didn't enjoy this. Waterproof boots recommended.

I believe it's more beautiful to visit the Cramond Island on a sunny day. To relax and see the view from the island and feel the salty wind.",4
Local Flavor,"I've lived on Holyrood Road for over 2 years now, and it still never seems to get any better of livelier. At one point, we had a small (but successful) supermarket but was, sadly, short-lived. Yeah there are two nice sandwich shops and a nice coffee shop. But that's it. That's where the liveliness ends. It drives me crazy that I have to get in the car for a pint of milk, and the nearest supermarket is about 10mins away by car. The area has so much potential and it drives me crazy to think that it's just sitting there doing nothing! Whenever I see a tourist here I lingure a bit to see if they need directions - they must be lost. 
It is next door to the Parliament, the Palace, Dynamic Earth and has great views of the Craggs and Arthurs Seat....yet it has nothing special about it. I wish it had a bit more life! It's a famous road so it should have something more to offer than a couple coffee shops and a seedy housing estate!",3
Local Flavor,"It's hard not to be bowled over by the sweeping Crags of the Holyrood area, and the immenseness of Arthur's Seat at the centre of Holyrood Park. I've been running here a few times, and on one occasion there was this amazing fog and mist hanging over the large expanse of water on the route round Arthur's Seat, and the whole area just felt absolutely haunting and amazing. I do feel we're really lucky in Edinburgh to have places of such natural beauty, so close and accessible from the centre of town. 

The Holyrood area also encompasses The Scottish Parliament, exhibition centre Dynamic Earth, and Holyrood Palace. I'm a little bit ashamed to say I've never been to Holyrood Palace, or maybe I did go on one of those school trips I can't remember, but it's one of those scenarios where I always say I will go, but when something's on your doorstep, you put it off. However, I definitely have been to The Scottish Parliament, worth a look so you can form an opinion, if you wish, on the controversial expense of the architecture, but I more enjoyed peering into the Debating Chamber and chilling there for a while.",4
Local Flavor,"Just a few minutes from the city centre, accidentally walking into the Holyrood area can often seem a bit odd as it will quite literally feel as if you've arrived in the middle of nowhere.

That's not a criticism. The looming presence of Arthur's Seat is very impressive, and there are few city centres in the world graced with rugged natural beauty on the doorstep.

In terms of actual civilisation, there's the hapless parliament, and tourist attractions such as Dynamic Earth and unsurprisingly, Holyrood Palace. The past few years have also seen a few moderately high-profile companies open up offices in the area, yet in some ways it still feels a bit underdeveloped.

I quite like it this way though, one of the more peaceful locations within easy reach of the city centre.",4
Local Flavor,"Holyrood is unmissable.  If you missed it during your time in Edinburgh then you were either walking around with your eyes closed or in Glasgow.

It's well worth a visit, but unless you know where you are going it can be a little tricky to navigate through.  I do, however, fortunately have some tips on getting the best out of a visit to Holyrood.

My advice is to start near Holyrood Palace where there is a car park.  Then head either up Sailsbury Crag or head left and up towards the old chapel (St Anthony's) just above the loch.  Here you will find great views from St Anthony's and then from here you can head up and left and you will see Arthur's Seat.  The climb from here isn't too demanding and you should soon be at the top appreciating the view.",4
Local Flavor,"I can't believe I almost passed this up. I thought to myself, I've seen Edinburgh Castle. You've seen one castle... you've seen them all! NOT TRUE.

The most interesting part of this castle, was to see how England, Scotland and even America, are all interconnected so deeply. How one country's triumph was another country's failure. All a matter of perspective I suppose. And to think many turning points in Scotland and England's history and current state affairs came/come to fruition where I walked this past August. Though its no Versailles, or not even a Hearst Castle, Holyrood has its own charms.

The audio-guides were helpful in painting a picture of what the original purpose of the room was and how they are utilized today. I'm a history person, so I love learning about how things were back when kings and queens weren't simply heads of state. 

I do wish I was able to take pictures. If I had more time, I would have liked to climb Arthur's Seat, which isn't to far from the Holyrood gates.

Holyrood has to be one of the top 5 things to see when visiting Edinburgh. It also doesn't take a lot of time to tour either, maybe 1-2 hours tops, so there really is no reason to miss this gem.",5
Local Flavor,"In the beginning, we weren't sure if we even wanted to do this. These were some of the last tickets I purchased before coming out here, and even then we weren't entirely sure it'd be worth our time.

For those that have never heard of it, Holyroodhouse is the Queen's Scotland estate - basically, where she resides in the summer months. It's a working palace, so there are only so many places that we could visit, but the rooms that we saw (accompanied by yet another free audio guide) were interesting for many different reasons.

Pictures aren't allowed in Holyroodhouse, so once again we have to rely on our fading, booze-laden memories.

However, one memory that is not likely to die at any point is this: we were in a room that was detailing the Order of the Thistle - there were details about the Order, as well as a display of regalia and such. We were standing next to a velvet rope in front of the glass case that holds Queen Elizabeth's robes when I accidentally stepped too far, bumped the velvet rope, which swung out and broke a beam, which immediately set off an alarm. A very loud, obnoxious alarm.

Hands up, a look of guilt on my face, I turned to look at the warder working that room, who made eye contact with me and addressed the room to tell everybody it was okay, while also calling in a guard to deactivate the alarm. He then turned to me and said I had gotten too close, and set off the laser. I wanted to argue that it was the velvet rope that had broken the beam, but I don't think he would have seen my point. Plus, you know - the rope can't move on its own.

Whatever - the guard came in and reset the alarm, and we continued on with the tour, but I was absolutely more careful about where I put my fat self from there on out.
I was most fascinated by Mary, Queen of Scots quarters. Not just for her sad history, but also for the memorabilia they had in there. Because I'm still firmly entrenched in the ""Outlander"" series, I was immediately drawn to all the references to Bonnie Prince Charlie. And there were a ton. His jewels, two of his pistols (they were so small they looked like toys), locks of his hair, letters he had written - it's quite the collection!

The weather was nice enough to allow us a chance to walk through the gardens, which has a path that leads from the ruins of the Abbey. The Abbey ruins are at once impressive and sad, but definitely worth a visit.

I enjoyed our time here a lot more than I anticipated. It's a nice stroll down the Royal Mile to the gates of Holyrood, and from there you've got a great view of Arthur's Seat and Calton Hill. There's plenty to do and see, and of course they have a café and gift shop on premises.",4
Local Flavor,"Leith Walk is the diverse stretch of retail leading from the east end of Princes Street to Leith, consisting of shops, restaurants, bars and pretty much the most random selection of anything that you're likely to encounter on one singular street in Edinburgh.

It's not the most aesthetically beautiful of the thoroughfares you'll encounter in Edinburgh, but Edinburgh is a better looking city than most anyway, (local's bias clearly entering the review here), and sometimes character is more attractive than superficial allure anyway. It's absolutely worth not taking the bus and having a walk down the walk (heh heh, tuneful), if you're heading into Leith, or heading into town. Despite the amount of years I've lived in Edinburgh, I always find myself peering into various shop windows, swivelling my eyes everywhere like a child in a sweetie shop, and I always manage to encounter something new.

Check out the Word of Mouth cafe, the brilliant Elvis Shakespeare music and books store, La Favorita for pizza, the Victoria bar for some Swedish cider, and the variety of other establishments that give this street its colour, and feeling of community.",4
Local Flavor,"Having never lived on the Lieth side of the city, it wasnt until a friend moved here that I had ever been to Leith Walk.

Stretching from the Leith Docks to the Omni Centre near Princes Street is a huge stretch of road, that at one point was imply a way of getting from these two important areas of the city. However, the term 'up-and-coming' really does apply here, because Leith Walk is currently under going major regeneration - and it seems to be working. 

If you want it, chances are Leith Walk has it. Its got a lot of restaurants, shops, bars and cafes - most of which are quirky and independantly owned, so of course there is lots of local flavour.

Leith Walk is a realy great place to come for a change of scene - its much more 'real' than Princes Street, and is beginning to become a great place for some alternative shopping.",4
Local Flavor,"Stretching all the way from the east end of Princes St to the beginnings of the Leith area, Leith Walk offers an alternative to the mainstream tourist areas and apparently it's one of the longest streets in the whole of Edinburgh.

Teeming with pubs, cafe's, and restaurants and with plenty of small shops dotted here and there, Leith Walk offers a healthy portion of things to see and do.

No doubt you'll end up forming your own opinion of Leith Walk, some shops are totally naff, whilst others offer something different to the main tourist area of Edinburgh.",4
Local Flavor,"I took a stroll along Leith Walk today and felt a strange cominbation of surprise, depression and unease.

My dramatic moodswings could be due to the nature that this road is a bit bipolar. Most streets tend to have a low and a high end if they are this long, but Leith Walk seems to mix both together like it's hopscotch. I'd trudge past endless discount carpet outlets only to find a cute cafe tucked away in a corner. When you get to the bottom end of it it's a little rough around the edges, but then you'll be surprised by an antique shop and a cool guitar store.

An odd one. I can't say it's the most pleasant area in Edinburgh, but in parts it's got some hidden gems.",3
Local Flavor,"A friend of mine lives on Leith Walk and had a party there recently. When my boyfriend and I left, there was a group of neds outside who must have only been around 17. After unloading a mouthful of abuse on us (for no reason), one of the neds told me to ""remember the BNP as they would be coming for me"". 

I take from this that Leith Walk is brimming with uneducated, racist fools who are a drain on society. 

There are some nice little cafes if you want to mingle with the locals.",2
Local Flavor,"Following the recent advertising slogan...I love Leith!!

there's something really grounded and down to earth about it. The walk down just summarizes everything I love about it. You can see as you walk down this road how it changes from Edinburgh-esque bars with trendy furniture and cool smoking areas to lovely pubs with genuine people and good atmospheres. 

When you arrive in Leith you've gone a full transformation from 'yah yah yah' to 'yes yes yes' to 'aye aye aye' - totally honest Edinburgh locals and in a totally enjoyable place",5
Local Flavor,"Whenever I've taken a trip down Leith Walk, I always feel on edge. There has never been a time that I've walked down hassle free or without someone asking me for spare change. Just the other week I was stopped no less than 3 times before I was a quarter of the way down and one of the men asking me for money got rather aggressive when I said no and followed me for a few metres until someone else came along. Leith Walk reminds me of Victoria Street in Glasgow, somewhere that I'd never walk along on my own.

No matter what time of day you find yourself here, there's always an abundance of drunken men spilling out of the bookies and pubs than line the street.

There is a good mix and selection of shops and many independent stores too which is refreshing but the seedy undertone to Leith Walk puts me of going anywhere near it and although you'd probably never come to any harm here, I'd still recommend walking here with a friend, especially at night!",2
Local Flavor,"Without a shadow of a doubt my favourite street, anywhere, Leith Walk is as far removed from the picture postcard Edinburgh as it is possible to be. In my opinion though, it's got more culture, wit and plain old real life in grubby doorway than the entire Royal Mile, by a long shot.

Polish delis, Middle Eastern fashion stores, shifty pubs, greasy spoons, and a shop that sells only dartboards and twenty year old TV sets, it's the most fascinating and multicultural street in the whole of Edinburgh. It would take weeks to sample all it has to give, which is a lot more than tartan underpants and miniature statues of a kilted Mel Gibson.

A couple of yuppie style bars have made an appearance, leading to a lot of superlatives such as ""up and coming"" to be bandied about by reptilian estate agents. Ignore them, Leith Walk already arrived centuries ago and it's perfect as it is.",5
Local Flavor,"Leith Walk very much embodies cosmopolitan Edinburgh in a street. Few of the best Italian restaurants  in Edinburgh reside here, like La Favourita, Vittoria (and some of the worst) you have 3 of the 5 ""Swedish Bars"" (Boda, Victoria and Joseph Pearce) you also have Asian , Indian, Burmese and Turkish Restaurants or eateries. American (KFC / Pizza Hut / Dominoes / Pappa Joe's), Polish & Mexican Takeaways and a wide variety of international supermarkets and shops for Halal, Chinese and Baltic flavours - but obviously your Co-Op and Tesco reside here too. 
Estate Agents and Pharmacies seem to own the street but look further and you'll find bakeries, alteration, electrical, computer & board games exchange (Games Exchange) and of course The Pipeshop - near the Foot of the Walk - for all your tobacco paraphernalia. Then there are the banks, hairdressers pet shops, wine merchants and charity shops. -pfffft ..you got them all here!

Living in Leith I found that there is no need to go anywhere else for my daily and certainly exotic food supplies. 
For evenings out there are plenty of bars & restaurants to cater for your patronage and pleasure. From brown cafe's to trendy establishments and everything in-between.

Also the 'walk' is a haven for bus travellers - you can get nearly most of the buses in Edinburgh on the Walk and many more on Elm Row. (interchange) 

I like to savour (& keep) the flavour of this street and its many many different characters. I would also like to see it done up.. There are too many under developed sites on this street and some neglected spaces which make this brilliant street a little underwhelming and unattractive to the 'casual' folk out there. 

Honestly give it a chance, visit and find out what a brilliant street Leith Walk is.",4
Local Flavor,"leith walk is a unique place in edinburgh.  it starts at the east end of princes street and then continues all the way down to the start of great junction street.  the 'walk' connects what used to be two different towns, the great city of edinburgh to the proud town of leith.  now we're all one, but i still like that as you walk down leith walk you can feel a distinct change between edinburgh and leith.

not only is there the difference between the two towns, but leith walk is home to some amazing restaurants, bars, and take aways.  a few favourites of mine would include i heart cafe (amazing couscous salad and sandwiches!!), joseph pearce (hasselback potatoes anyone?), la favourita (delicious wood fired pizzas and tasty pastas), los cardos (tex mex goodness!), the brass monkey (awesome pub quiz monday and scrummy nachos), cafe marlayne (lovely french bistro), gaia (for homemade sicilian food and friendly service), and the list goes on!

there is also a very large library on the corner of mcdonald road and leith walk, a police station just off the walk on gayfield square in case you need some added safety, the leith co-op cycle shop, a large asian supermarket, a number of smaller supermarkets (tesco express, the co-op), two post offices, and even a few hair and beauty places.

from the numerous bus stops on leith walk you can get pretty much anywhere in edinburgh from along princes street, to the south of town and the meadows, and even all the way out to the gyle industrial estate where i work.  if you are feeling a bit flush then just hail one of the many taxis that come along the walk regularly and get anywhere you need to go.

leith walk is one of the best streets in edinburgh.  it has literally everything one could need and connects two very lovely areas of this beautiful city together.",4
Local Flavor,"It's a bit mental. 

In fact it's a perfect sliding scale of mentalness/randomness. 

The top of Leith Walk (closest end to town) is relatively normal.
The bottom of Leith Walk is a hive of random activity.
The walk between to two points is like a tour into the insanity of humanity.

Leith is a great place to live.",4
Local Flavor,"Four older folk are sitting on a bench at the 'Foot of the Walk' bathing themselves in the afternoon sun, whilst having a blether and catching up on the latest Leith gossip. Next to them, a younger man is sprawled out having what looks like a pleasant snooze, and very sweet dreams. Across the 'Kirkgate', a gentleman has been imbibing the best ale in Leiths finest pubs, and is swaying on the gentlest of breezes while his friend is laughing at his expense. Meanwhile, the ever-present hot-dog vendor is touting his wares, as a wondrous smell of onions drifts around. Most people are happy, and everyone is smiling...

...including me!

I have lived just off Leith Walk for over a decade now, and witnessing the scene above, this very afternoon, reminded me of why I love it so much! From born and bred 'Leithers', to visitors from countries far and wide, Leith Walk and it's community are vibrant, full of energy and ever evolving 

Only here can you shop in a wide range of Chinese, Polish and Indian supermarkets, pick up jewellery (definitely head to 'The Cats Miou' for beautiful gifts), tobacco, a banjo or a bed from the various independent stores that pepper the 'Walk', do your laundry in one of the friendliest laundrettes around (that's the 'Laundrette' by the way!) and mooch among the variety of charity, and antique, shops looking for a bargain.

Once you're done shopping, you can rest your laurels in one of the superb Leith Walk eateries or bars. Of course, there are oodles of them, and I'd urge you to spend an afternoon sampling their fine wares. My favourites would include 'Brass Monkey Leith' (great atmosphere, selection of beers,delicious food, quiz & a dart board!), the 'Sicilian Pastry Shop' (not quite on the Walk, but close enough to count!), 'Joseph Pearce', 'Boda', 'Victoria' (all members of the same Swedish bar family),  'Qupi' Greek cafe, 'La Favorita' (delicious pizza!), 'Ecos' Moroccan cafe (great coffee & delicious traditional food) and 'I Heart Cafe' (a chilled out lunch with free wi-fi). Many of them have tables outdoors, and when you you walk past on a sunny day, you'd be forgiven for thinking you're on holiday. It just has that amazing, chilled out vibe! 

Sure, there is the odd dodgy bar here and there, and a couple of places I wouldn't settle down to lunch in...but in their own right, they still add to the character of this diverse area. The folk are friendly, I feel quite safe here and, more importantly, it feels like home!  
 
Throughout the year, there are many festivals (Leithlate is happening soon!) and celebrations of Leith life, and I'll continue to enjoy wandering up and down Leith Walk witnessing all the fantastic goings on...I may even sit on a bench one day, with friends in the sun, and have a blether about it!",4
Local Flavor,"It seems like everyone and their dog has moved to this end of town recently. It's not ""on your way"" to anywhere except Leith, and friends' homes. So it's not somewhere folk will be 'passing through' often. Which is a shame, as it has such an eclectic array of shops, eateries and knick knacks that it's a fascinating wee (long) walk!

From the Cat's Miaou which is small but bursting with jewellery and knick knacks, fruit shops, burrito bars and taco shops, Polish pancake and pierogi stops, the Brass Monkey Leith (a great bar), Victoria (another great bar) and way more that I don't know about as I don't come here enough.

It looks a bit beat up, it's the prettiest street in Edinburgh. But if you walk down here and then onto Constitution and to the Shore, you'll pass a real taste of real Edinburgh and real Scotland.

Some locals of Leith don't consider themselves from Edinburgh. It's a wee slice of the type of Scotland my grandma and grandad grew up in, on the outskirts of our international melting pot of a city.",4
Local Flavor,It's a long walk but there are buses going up and down all day long if you find you are getting a little weary and you're feet are getting sore or the heavens decide to open and pour down!  Lots of interesting shops to go into and the vast amount of eating places - there's a plenty to choose from!,4
Local Flavor,"Full of quirky named pubs, appealing eateries and a liberal offering of designer clothing shops, Rose St is the fulcrum of Edinburgh's main tourist area.  

A lengthy stretch in-between the busy Princes St and more upmarket George St results in a street that is rather like a mixture of the two.  

You'll undoubtedly revert to Rose St time and time again as a means to find an ideal drinking spot and a bite to eat.",4
Local Flavor,"I often forget that this street exists. You see Princes street and George street are so big and busy you forget that Rose street is sandwiched in the middle- and has it's hidden gems as well.

It's the ideal place for a spot of lunch or a quick pint whilst shopping. It also is the address to many smaller shops- although still part of chains. It has changed a lot over the past years- but I would still advise people at night to be a bit wary of the side streets along here. 

On a brighter note, do check this street out you would be pleasantly surprised with the good eateries and pubs along here, which are always popular with the locals as well!",4
Local Flavor,"Whenever I am in town and need to walk, well anywhere I use Rose Street. Princes Street gets too busy and is overrun with those really annoying charity folk who stop you every two minutes so Rose Street is a safe passage.

It also has some nice pubs, shops and restaurants and almost feels miles away from the hustle and bustle of Princes Street. Rose Street is good for a bite to eat to get away from all the chain restaurants in the surrounding Princes Street and George Street.",4
Local Flavor,"I've always quite liked Rose Street. Compared to the grander offerings nearby, it's small and enclosed feel gives it some of the atmosphere of a small town high street right in the city centre, and the slightly cheaper rents here ensures that some of the UK's more loveable and interesting chain stores choose Rose Street as their Edinburgh base. I'm also quite a fan of the Sainsbury's at the end of the street, which is as far as I know the closest thing to a supermarket for quite some distance.

I have very little experience of the bars and restaurants down Rose Street, though from what i gather there are a few fairly competent options that thankfully bypass both the naffness of George Street, and the tourist trap nature of Princes Street.",4
Local Flavor,"First of all, let me just say that I have yet to meet anyone, or even meet anyone that has met someone, who has even come close to completing the infamous 'Rose Street Challenge'. 

When I first came to Edinburgh everyone told me this was one of the first things any self-respecting local (or tourist) should tick off their list at the first available opportunity, but when you stand at one end looking down the long narrow cobbles you realise that it's just not going to happen. Which, in fact, brings me to my first plus point: for such a tiny little street there is a huge number of bars, gastropubs, cafés and shops.

They're quite pricey in comparison to other parts of the city cente, as it's so popular with tourists, but it's abolutely gorgeous. My personal favourites are Seadogs (an amazing seafood and veggie place) or during the day the Garden Café at the back of The Dome is great for a spot of lunch al fresco.

By day, it's bustling but in a cute village-high-street sort of way. By night, and especially on weekends, it's bustling in a more hen/stag dos starting off here for the night until a local points them in the direction of a club sort of way.",4
Local Flavor,"Rose Street just has something about it - right in the middle between princes Street and George Street, to walk along it would have you believe you were no longer in the city centre, but rather on a quiet side street in a small town somewhere. It's quite a shock to the system the first couple of times.

Shops wise there is an eclectic mix of fashion, sports, music and various other random places as well as a large selection of bars and restaurant cafe things that always seem to be doing great business.

I would suggest however, staying at the Waverly end of Rose Street, all the better shops/cafe's seem to be up that end, with it getting abit quieter down the other end.",5
Local Flavor,"Rose Street has to be my favourite street in Edinburgh, this bustling cobbled street with street performers along it has a real holiday feel and I often forget I'm in Scotland whenever I stroll along it. Unlike Princes Street where everyone is in a rush, Rose Street is much more laid back and relaxed with people strolling along it taking their time to browse shop windows or stopping off for a drinks or food in one of the many pubs and restaurants housed here.

There's something for all ages on this street and there's a mix of a little bit of everything. The prices of most of the restaurants are very reasonable and it's much more natural than the souvenir touting shops that overtake so much of the capital city.",5
Local Flavor,"Rose Street is a very quaint, cobbled little street nestling behind the bustling Princes Street.

It plays host to a number of high end, cosy bars, trendy shops and usually some talented buskers. During the day it attracts a fair number of people due to its good, central shopping location, and in the evening it is filled with relaxed couples and groups looking for a nice meal. 

Relaxed and continental, I would definitely agree with the others in saying it's less brassy than the tourist mania that is Princes St. It strikes me as the kind of place you go to get a bit of peace and quiet, making it as popular with the locals as it is with visitors. It's pretty with unique offerings, and shouldn't be ignored in favour of the more commercial streets surrounding it.",4
Local Flavor,"I absolutely love walking down Rose Street, no matter what the weather is like. On a  sunny day, it's the place to be and be seen in Edinburgh, sitting outside on one of the many, many bars along the street. There is a lovely selection of shops too,ranging from snow sport shops to underwear shops. There are lots of really cute boutiques too.

Although Rose Street is wonderful in the summer, to me it is best during winter. They have a beautiful net of fairylights overhead to you feel like you're in a dream world. It's beautiful!",5
Local Flavor,"Ah, good old Rose St. The cobbled, sometimes debaucherous, sometimes surprising little sister of George Street and Princes Street (my inner language traditionalist wanted to call it a little brother, but Rose makes it a sister...irrelevancy really).

Anyhow, there's a real mix of banter to be found here, from the section of classy, cute little jewellery shops, which are well worth a look, to the strip of old school pubs, which are the focus of much tourist and pub crawl interest. I think an exploratory stroll along Rose St is well worth it, given it takes less than ten minutes to walk the length of it, and has a lot more individuality going on than its surrounding main thoroughfares. There are some cool wee restaurants too, like The Mussel Inn, and other places well worth trying your culinary luck with.",4
Local Flavor,"I love Rose Street, it basks in character and has a great atmosphere here that other streets don't have. Being squeezed between Princes Street and George Street means that the street very rarely gets much direct sunlight during the day, which means it is always pretty dark along it, which I actually quite like and gives it a certain charm.

The Street regularly has performers playing along it and as there is no cars to deafen out the noise as well as the fact that the street is so enclosed, it makes the performer sound clearer and louder, which is good if they are half decent! Rose Street is also home to a good set of pubs and restaurants and trendy shops and boutiques.",4
Local Flavor,"I always feel a little bit let down by Rose St, dont get me wrong...its great to a point, its has some great pubs and a couple of cracking wee restaurants but do you not think for where it is in our city it  could or in fact should be better?

You look at some of the restaurants/bars and for me im left scratching my head, they get by purely on location and im left wondering...if they were just a bit better how good could this street be!

Up your game Rose St!!!",3
Local Flavor,"Wedged between Princes Street and George Street is a little place that time forgot.  (That last bit is sort of true.) As a darkish back street of those behemoths shopping street and connecting Charlotte Square to St. Andrews Square it seemingly has little influence on the atmosphere of Edinburgh - but you'd be mistaken if you think that!

Surf shops. Double entendre pub names. Back entrances to the high street shops, bars & restaurants. Chippies, beer gardens, rock houses, legal spitting on the Rose. Cobbles.
Fairy lights covered  streets. A Californian restaurant. Relaxing massages, jewellers, 'executive' saunas. Asian food. Steak House. Cat shop. Dance shop. Hat shops. Mexican themed night clubs. French waffles, Champagne,  Mussels and Chips...and much much more.

Many buskers play and much coffee and beer is consumed. The atmosphere is accommodating and very pleasant - not as packed or rushed as its bigger brothers either side. It is a place to whistle, to hoppity skip through and generally feel pleasant. 

That is why I like walking through this, the sounds, the smells and this piece of Edinburgh that does give you ideas on how bygone time may have been...a bit.",4
Local Flavor,"Got to Love and appreciate Rosé st. It's like a mini- royal mile with all the shops and pubs. Lots of variety if pubs and restaurants. You can get Mexican/Spanish, Japanese, Indian, and Arabic just to name a few. Also has a great dessert place I need to review. Cheap pubs dotted up and down the st. Also a whiskey and tobacconist shop that has cigars and pipes and tons more. Be sure to take a walk down Rose st and enjoy all the shops and a little hidden area of Edinburgh .",4
Local Flavor,"I love Rose Street as it has many bars, restaurants and cafés to choose from. I've done the pub crawl here for a hen party many moons ago and have to say The Kenilworth and The Black Rose Tavern are my favourites. Especially the later for some rawk. Oh yeah!

It's also great during the days for some great shops. Also who was the evil genius who put a back entrance to Primark?! Oh dear! Hehe!! 

On this occasion I was here for some lunch. I have been here for breakfast a while back but that was to Greggs but we'll no talk about that one. Pffft! Sometimes Greggs just hits the spot. 

Anyhoo, I was spoiled for choice for lunch spots but definitely check out the menus as some are expensive. As they say it's good to shop around. 

Rose Street is a lovely cobbled street which runs parallel with Princes Street and definitely worth a walk along as it's a great wee stretch. Next time your in the Burgh take a wee donner and have a gander.",5
Local Flavor,"Broughton St is a ball ache to get to (if you live in Bruntsfield that is) but offers plenty of unique eateries, cafe's and clothing shops once you arrive.

Hosting the eccentric Cafe Piccante (read my review to find out why!) and the schizophrenic Basement Bar (also read review to find out more) to arguably the best coffee vendor in Edinburgh: Artisan Roast, Broughton St is definitely worth a peek and is fully capable of occupying you for a good few hours.

An interesting alternative to the centre of Edinburgh's shopping district.",4
Local Flavor,"I used to live at the bottom of Broughton Street and walking up that hill everyday was the bane of my life for a year. Good exercise though! 

It's perhaps not as sophisticated as Bruntsfield, but Broughton Street is getting there and is probably one of the up and coming areas of Edinburgh. I love Bliss, a shop full of unique little gifts. Crombies is great to pick up some meat for all your meat lovers and The Bakehouse is great for an afternoon coffee and cake session. Worth a look around as it is only a minute from the centre, and you can tone your ass walking back up the steep hill.",4
Local Flavor,"Broughton Street is a trek and a half to say the least from where I live, but the exercise is definitely worth it.  It has a unique and varied selection of shops, ranging from a specialist watch repairs shop to Edinburgh best butcher's.  Personally, my favourite is The Bakehouse which serves an amazing and delicious array of baked goods.  However, there are also plenty of bars and restaurants, each serving their own speciality food and drink.  
The street also feels like it has a good bit of history to it, with good, solid architecture and well-worn pavements.  So whether you're looking for a haircut, a newspaper of Edinburgh's finest meat, Broughton Street is the place.",4
Local Flavor,"It needs work. Don't get me wrong: I like Broughton Street. I frequent the shops and establishments regularly and most of those are fine. 

The street itself needs some beautification, the pavements and houses are looking tired. But on the other hand this is a beautiful preserved street. Old Victorian houses and little independent shops make it work. Some establishments need special mention. 
Artisan Roast - coffee to order and Real Foods - one of the first organic shops in Edinburgh. 

An enjoyable street.",3
Local Flavor,"If you want to go ever so slightly off the beaten track from town, Broughton Street is worth exploring. It's great for coffee, dining, drinking and gift buying. 

Some highlights include:

Artisan Roast - the original third wave coffee place. Quirky with great coffee, it's open till 7.30pm during the week; one of few coffee places to go after work.

Lots of restaurants - The Olive Branch, L'Escargot, Riparian Rooms, Burger Meats Bun newly opened Seasons. At weekends it gets busy and and on sunny days your find some al fresco dining.

Pubs - you'll find old man pubs such as Barony Bar and more trendy affair such as Treacle, the OX. 

Shopping - a great place to try for gifts. There is Curiouser and Curiouser and other similar gift shops selling Scottish gifts/candles/pictures etc. 
There is a florist, some good off-licenses and Crombies for a fine selection of sausages and meat.

It's close to John Lewis and on some Saturdays you can go up to the tram stop market by St Mary's for some street food. New places are opening and it remains a great worth to wander down.",4
Local Flavor,"just like the vegas strip - but with food instead of showgirls. 

meat, cheese, stiller's gear - the holy pittsburgh trinity, all here for the taking.

there aren't many things that get me out of bed before 10am - but this is one of them.",5
Local Flavor,Eh.  We may have gone at the wrong times (July 4th when everything was close and a sunday afternoon) but it seemed not that great.  I would have liked it if the cheese and meat places were open but ce la vie.  we did get stuck in a huge rainstorm here.,3
Local Flavor,"Hmmm if I ever go back to Pittsburgh maybe I will be able to check out the Strip when there's actually people around - it was pretty empty when we were there, unfortunately.  There were at least a few coffee shops around and one over-priced chocolate shop, not much else though that I saw in the way of anything interesting.  Maybe we were on the wrong street or maybe just bad timing.",3
Local Flavor,"This place was amazing.  I spent over two hours weaving my way  through people and street vendors checking out the wide variety of stores.  I really enjoyed all the different ethnic stores.  It was amazing to have an Italian, Greek, Mexican, Korean, and Chinese grocery store all on the same street.  
I loved Penzeys spices!  They had an excellent selection and the staff was very friendly.  Overall the highlight was Wholey Seafood.  The selection was diverse and fresh.
This district makes me want to visit Pittsburgh all the time!",5
Local Flavor,"There is a lot of good stuff you can find on the Strip District in Pittsburgh. Places that people remember the rest of their lives when they move. Places and businesses that are nationally known. That is all good. You can find just about anything and if you visit Pittsburgh, or live near, you absolutely MUST check it out. My favorites are: Pennsylvania Macaroni, Enricos, Wholeys, Presto George, Reyna Foods, Leaf and Bean, Primanti's, Pamela's, etc.  

The downside is:
Lots of traffic, hard to find parking unless you are willing to search, big crowds especially Saturday mornings, holidays etc. 
If you go on Sunday prepare to find many businesses not open or closing earlier than their marked hours, short hours if they are open.

The big downside is:
Be careful - it is NOT easy to cross the street because of aggressive drivers, lots of people, and the vendors set up stands blocking more than half of what is an inadequately sized sidewalk to begin with. Sometimes the sidewalk is completely blocked. There is little enforcement of panhandling laws, or laws that are supposed to keep the sidewalks clear.  The sidewalks in some spots are practically impassable forcing you to walk in the street between cars. You sure can get a parking ticket or towed though. Because of this I never buy anything from the sidewalk vendors. Pittsburgh must choose, close the street, enforce keeping sidewalks open or watch people get hit by cars. 

Other than that, be sure to check it out. Just BE CAREFUL!",4
Local Flavor,"A ""must do"" experience for anyone visiting Pittsburgh.  And it should be a regular part of every Pittsburgher's shopping regimen.  

For tourists and families visiting Pittsburgh, the Strip District is a microcosm of everything the city is, both its best and its blemishes.  Great food, amazing sidewalk shopping, and Pittsburgh's warm and welcoming personality.  Visitors absolutely should visit Penn Macaroni, Wholey's and PrestoGeorge.  Looking for a great breakfast?  DeLuca's!  (cash only, though)  Looking for good middle eastern food?  Labads!   Eager for some great biscotti?  Enrico Biscotti (but be prepared for cranky, unfriendly staff).  Pork products?  Parma Sausage (which, a friend from Italy tells me, has the best prosciutto he's ever had).   Coffee?  PrestoGeorge.   Fish sandwich?  Wholey's!   Cheese, pasta, olives?  Penn Mac!

But take the time to just stroll up and down Penn Avenue and ENJOY the crowded sidewalks.  Browse the tables of goods offered by the sidewalk vendors.  Pick up a Steelers' T-shirt, connoli, a chicken kabob or egg roll, or a Pittsburgh souvenir.  

Parking is a challenge, but not impossible.  On Saturdays, you can find parking on Penn Avenue if you get there by 8.00a or so.  Later in the morning, cruise the side streets or Smallman.  Don't be afraid to park a few blocks away and walk.  

You live here?  There's no better place to find good, fresh fish (Wholey's), sausage/salami (Parma), coffee/tea (PrestoGeorge), Italian foods (Penn Mac), bread (Mancini's) and Asian foods (Sam Bok) than the Strip District.  It's well-worth heading down there twice a month.  

Above are the hits.  The misses?  We're not thrilled with the quality of vegetables and meats.  It's hit-or-miss for these.   Some of my friends swear by Jo-Jo's as Pittsburgh's best breakfast, but the seating is a uncomfortable for me.  Roland's always disappoints me (check out the reviews on Yelp).  Pamela's is okay for breakfast, but the decor is ""fake nostalgic"" and just too much for me.",5
Local Flavor,"If you're going to Pittsburgh and visit the strip district, go during the day to go shopping - do NOT believe for one moment that it's a place to go out at night. I read (not here) and heard that the Strip District had good night life and restaurants and booked a hotel based on that. What a mistake. Go to the Strip District for shopping and lunch, but at night, you'll want to be on Carsen St. Learn from my mistake.",3
Local Flavor,"I highly recommend going on a tour of this area to help point out the good spots and the history hiding behind every corner (Burghs and Bites tour). This is a vast area with two chain stores, tons of independent shops and eateries and an indoor traditional market. There are outdoor street vendors selling foods and clothes and gifts and people everywhere. There is street parking but i redommend a lot which can be obtained for less than $6 depending on how long you stay. I definitely recommend going hungry and spending two hours or so sampling things up and down the streets and checking out the historic ethnic churches. Most shops it seems close by dinner time with one Parma Meats I noticed closed at 1530.",4
Local Flavor,"The Strip District is a popular hang out and shopping mecca for anyone in the Burgh. 

Penn ave gets packed and why shouldn't it? It's freakin' great down there.  So be prepared for the crowd. I love the outdoor market feel. There is no other place like it in all the city.  When you're shopping in the Strip you're really a part of History. The area has been around 1814. Don't pass up a chance to go to the Hienz History Center while you're down there.

There's never a dull moment in the Strip.  I relish getting a chicken on a steak and perusing the wares of the outdoor vendors. You can find everything from Yinzer pride Pittsburgese t-shirts to fresh fruits and veggies.  

The Strip is one stop shopping at it's finest.",4
Local Flavor,"This is a meat lovers paradise, everything is fresh, so heavenly fresh and God so affordable. On my latest visit I purchased pork chops, hot Italian sausage and a 5 pound bag of chicken wings for less than $35.  Rewind to last year, I started to notice that Giant Eagle chicken wings have become giant grotesque flavorless monster meat. Because of this I started shopping at Strip District Meats.  The wings are appropriately sized and delicious. In fact everything I've purchased here is delicious. The hot sausage has got to be the best I've ever eaten. They're good every way to, grilled, baked, fried, boiled etc... 

I couldn't be more pleased with the selection and quality of meats. They have just about everything under the sun including chorizo!!!  

Be warned though, this butcher shops is tiny and gets packed. The staff moves fast but it can get cramped in there. It's a boisterous crowd that shops in there. 

This is my go to meat shop.",4
Local Flavor,Wonderful place for strolling around and getting fresh produce on a Saturday morning. Love the sushi from Andy in Wholey's Seafood (you can park in the lot right across the street from Lotus if you're buying stuff from Whole'ys) and the korean chicken kabob on the street outside the small Asian grocery store. Yes the parking is difficult but I just deal with it.,4
Local Flavor,As first time visitors to Pittsburgh we were very happy with the tour we had of the Strip District. There are a ton of restaurants and shops and the history of the area is incredible. I'd recommend anyone visit this area.,5
Local Flavor,"If only all family visits in PA kicked off with a visit to the Strip. Chocolate. Pierogies. Mile high sandwiches. Jazz on the streets. Dr.Seuss fabric. Dried floral wreaths. Just a wee sampling of the items that razzle me while visiting strolling through the District on a Saturday morning. 

The best part about the strip? No matter the weather, Pittsburghians (does this word exist?) come out in droves for fresh Italian breads on the streets topped with jalapenos, pepperonis and cheese, baklava and produce sold even when there's snow in the air. 

My favorites:
hot chocolate from Chocolat (as close to the Swiss/Italian Chocolate al densa as you'll get) - I recommend the spiced, dark chocolate option - they'll let you sample to make the final call

Pierogies and other polish goodies from S&D Polish Deli (eat in and take some home for later from the big freezer of pierogies in the back)

Sandwiches from the classic Primanti Brothers - coleslaw, meat and whatever else you could imagine mashed between two thick pieces of bread. 

Macaroni Company: buzzing cheese counter, olive oil barrels, great selection of Italian sweets (including my mom's favorite: poppyseed roll bread)

Can't wait for the next visit and to knock off some new businesses off my list. 

Wish folks from Indy would embrace the cooler weather like this.",5
Local Flavor,"This is the part of town where you can get whatever you want, somewhere, at a decent price, from somebody who knows exactly what you need and Pittsburgh's always going to the Super Bowl, here we go, Steelers, here we go. Just watch out for the tourists. And the nightclub crowd.

My understanding from a lifetime of shopping here: buy your biscotti at Enrico, grab some grape leaves at Stamooli's, catch up on the lasest cheeses at Penn Mac, load up on chocolate at Mon Amis, stockpile steaks at Strip District Meats, catch a fish at Wholey's, appease your orientalist fetishes at Lotus, sharpen your knife at In The Kitchen, engage in spice trading at Penzey's, get veggies at Stan's, bread from Sunseri's, for starters.",5
Local Flavor,"Wow. Love this place - any day of the week! There is so much to do here; that's the reason why most people feel that this is one of the best areas to hang out in the 'Burgh.

It sucks to drive down Penn Avenue on the weekend, but for good reason - there's so much to do! Personal favorites are PBT for childrens' ballet classes, Wigle Whiskey for honestly amazing drinks and great libations, the Lotus Food Company for asian grocery, Wholey's for fish/seafood, and enjoy all the stops in-between!

This place is definitely our go-to when we have out of town guests to show the city, and they are always happy we did. Honestly guys, thanks! You've made a ""Yinzer"" out of this good ol' Southern boy...

Will definitely be back...",5
Local Flavor,"Husband and I have been to Pittsburgh a handful of times now.  After our last visit Moms asked me, ""Haven't you exhausted that city by now?""

Yeah, no.  Pitt is chock full of awesome things to do.  We've only just scratched the surface.  Every time we visit we try to do something new and different.  

Know what we do *every* time, tho?  Visit The Strip.  Usually more than once.

On the weekends, The Strip District pulsates with activity.  Brick-and-mortars throw their doors open, street vendors set up shop, local produce markets thrive, and artisans sell their wares.  Throngs of people swell the sidewalks and streets.  Tourists and locals abound.  It's the most vital and exciting place in the 'Burgh.

Walk here if you can.  If you must, park early (I'm talking the crack of).  Pop in anywhere that looks good -- don't miss Wholey's, Pennsylvania Macaroni Company, Penn Avenue Pottery, DeLuca's, Mancini's Bread or In the Kitchen. 

You haven't visited Pitt until you've strolled the Strip.  Trust me on this one.",5
Local Flavor,"This was such a cool area of Pittsburgh! While on a weekend vacation to see a Braves/Pirates game, we were told by several people to check out the Stript District in Pittsburgh so we did on Saturday. There were stands of fruits, vegetables, flowers, bread, desserts, clothing all along the streets. It was a lot of fun just to walk around and see what all they had to offer. There were tons of places to eat and all kinds of shops. 

One of the shops we stopped into was Wholey's Fish Market and though we couldn't buy anything because we had no way to keep it cold, it was cool just to walk around and see all of the fish and fresh meat they offered. We also checked out the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company and I wanted to buy all the cheese and olives they had there. Oils, nuts, pastas, meats, cheeses. It was an Italian food lover's dream. We finished the day by buying a cannoli on the street after lunch to share and just enjoyed the beautiful weather as we walked up and down each section. This is one place I would go back to again on my next visit.",4
Local Flavor,"Quintessential Pittsburgh!!  There is everything here anyone could want.   Parking is a nightmare and I would stay away from this place on the weekend,  and on a holiday weekend forget about it!  That being said I still give it 6 stars if I could.  Great shops and even better food.  I'm here once a month for a good afternoon of shopping and some good eats!",5
Local Flavor,"I really enjoy places such as this ... and I expect a little bit of grit in my refurbished warehouse/industrial districts, but this is as dirty a retail rehab district as I've ever seen. Asides from the parking being a mismanaged fiasco, I blame the local business owners for not sweeping up outside and around their businesses and not even caring to cut a few weeds outside their doorways.

I have no doubts The Strip has earned its reputation, places such as this are really a joy to visit and get a feel for a city, but the business owners are trashing that reputation by not taking better care of it.",3
Local Flavor,"The Strip District is an old industrial and warehouse area that has become an active street market type district.  Vendors line the street selling produce, crafts, sports team gear and various other products on Friday to Sunday.  Our first visit was on a Saturday morning where we found the place packed with people squeezing their way up and down the narrow sidewalks.  We went for breakfast at a restaurant, but found some cool shops to check out along the way including a pottery shop, kitchen supply shop, Asian grocery store, and a bakery that I regret not buying anything from.  Our second visit was after the market had already packed up leaving the place dead.  It would be nice to see wider sidewalks or perhaps closing off the street to making it pedestrian only during peak times.  Well worth a visit while in Pittsburgh!",4
Local Flavor,"The place to go for fresh produce, good food, and a lively crowd...year round.  Love it here. I try to come here weekly.",5
Local Flavor,"This is always an interesting part of Pittsburgh to visit and it's really the place to be on most weekends.  For most Pittsburgher's, it's a tradition.  This part of Pittsburgh dates back to the 19th century and was originally home to mills and factories.  Located along the Allegheny River, this was a good spot for transportation of goods and materials.  U.S. Steel, Westinghouse and The Pittsburgh Reduction Company were early tenants of the Strip District.  This was later the location for H.J. Heinz Company, famous for ketchup. The Strip District later became a spot for wholesalers of meat, poultry and produce.  Even later, restaurants and grocery stores were built to serve the local workers.  By the 1920s, the Strip District was the economic center of Pittsburgh.

Today, there are still several wholesalers and produce dealers, but gone is the manufacturing plants and mills. Many of the abandoned warehouses have been renovated into small specialty shops, restaurants, nightclubs, and bars. Stand out historical buildings include the St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, which was built in the 1891 to 1892.  Another beautiful building is the century-old Chautauqua Lake Ice Company building which houses The Senator John Heinz History Center.  

The area has developed into a historic market district with an interesting mix of  ethnic foods, art studios, antique dealers, interesting boutiques, and other businesses setting up shop where trains once delivered products by the ton. The Strip District is alive on weekends during the summer months as the ever-changing variety of sidewalk vendors hock their wares, the open-air farmer's markets are in full swing, and others sit outside and enjoy a drink.

The area has seen interest by residential developers recently.  Some of the old factory and warehouse buildings are being transformed into apartments and lofts. Examples include the Cork Factory, Brake House Lofts Apartments and more recently the Otto Milk Condos.

For us, it's a hangout to casually pretend to shop, generally buying a lot of nothing, but looking at everything.  We also like to try a different restaurant on every visit.",4
Local Flavor,"Our friends live in the Strip District of Pittsburg. When we visited them last fall between weddings in DC & NY, we had fun exploring the area. We were only there for a few nights and it was in the middle of the week so we didn't get the full deal, but the strip is still worth checking out, regardless of what day it is. If we go back to Pittsburg, we'll try to go between Fri & Sun to get in on all the action. After reading some of the other reviews it sounds like we missed out.  We still had fun and we recommend checking it out.",4
Local Flavor,"I did a lot of research before my trip to Pittsburgh and saw review after review recommending the Strip District. I wasn't really sure what to expect but I'm SO glad I went.  This is a destination not to be overlooked and Pittsburghers are so lucky to have these foodie resources in their own backyard!  It's basically one big area where old factories have been turned into stores, bars and restaurants. Vendors line the sidewalks.  Stores keep their doors open and offer free tastes.  

My first stop was the famous Primanti Brothers, which deserves a review all on its own! Today, many of the abandoned warehouses have been renovated into small specialty shops, restaurants, nightclubs, and bars. The historic St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, a landmark built in the ornate Polish Cathedral style in 1891, lies in the heart of the Strip District, bringing a touch of Old World architecture.
The area has developed into a historic market district with many ethnic food purveyors, some art studios, antique dealers, unique boutiques, and other businesses setting up shop where trains once delivered produce by the ton. The Strip District comes alive primarily on weekends during the summer months when street vendors are selling their wares, the open-air farmer's markets are in full swing, and party-goers sit outside and enjoy a drink.  By 1 or so, things have mostly closed down.  I made a stop at Stamooli's to sample some cheese and check out the Greek yummies. I also ducked into the classic Pennsylvania Macaroni Co., known as Penn Mac to the legion of local fans. At Penn Mac you can stock up on Italian goods from olive oils to imported San Marzano tomatoes, and a cheese section with its wide selection.  One foodie item I was determined to sample was Isaly's chipped ham, which I found at Penn Mac and got a free taste. I'd also heard great things about Mon Aimee Chocolate so I decided to take a look. It's very expensive but most of the chocolate is imported. I was able to find some European chocolate for my chocolate snob hubby though, so that was a perk! I've heard the hot chocolate (in back) is to die for.  Didn't give it a try.  Eventually I made my way to Wholey's, another highly recommended stop. Seafood is the draw.
If it's any indication how fresh the produce is at Wholey's, the on-site sushi chef uses tuna, yellowtail and salmon straight from the ice-packed samples on display. Wholey's is a locally-owned supermarket and wholesale company, where the aisles are packed with discerning shoppers.  I sampled some soup and it was amazing!! Oh how I wish we had something like this in Lincoln.  There were many items I wanted to take home.

In the early 19th century, the Strip District was home to many mills and factories as its location along the Allegheny River made for easy transportation of goods and shipping of raw materials. It was the home of the Fort Pitt Foundry, source of large cannon before and during the American Civil War, including a 20-inch bore Rodman Gun. Early tenants of the Strip District included U.S. Steel, Westinghouse, The Pittsburgh Reduction Company (ALCOA), and later The H.J. Heinz Company, famous ketchup and condiment manufacturer.

The shipping infrastructure built around the manufacturing companies naturally lead to an increase in other types of merchants setting up shop in the Strip. By the early 20th century the Strip District became a vibrant network of wholesalers--mostly fresh produce, meat, and poultry dealers. Soon, auction houses rose around the wholesale warehouses and many restaurants and grocery stores were built to feed hungry shift workers at any hour of the day. By the 1920s, the Strip District was the economic center of Pittsburgh.",4
Local Flavor,"I've been a huge fan of this little piece of the Burgh ever since I was a kid. My dad would take me down here every Thursday to gather food for Sunday supper. First stop was Allasandria Sausage, sadly gone now, but their homemade hot sausage was amazing. Next stop was Penn Mac, olive oils, hunks of Parm and Romano cheese for topping pasta. Flour and eggs for my great Grandmother's home made pastas. 

Needless to say, the strip has a soft spot in my heart. Today, the strip is an eclectic collection of shops, street vendors, bars, restaurants, food trucks, t shirts, sports memorabilia, bakeries, coffee and ethnic markets. The Cork Factory condos are here, as well at the Heinz History Center. The original Primanti's Is here, Lidia's, and two of Pittsburgh's top breakfast spots Pamala's and DeLuca's. 

A favorite of almost all locals, if you're a visitor there are two streets in Pittsburgh you must explore, Carson Street on the South Side and the Strip District's Penn Ave.",5
Local Flavor,"I visited this area for the first time in March 2014 with my family. We were just experiencing the city and not looking for anything specific. All of us loved it, young and old. We loved the little shops, especially Pittsburgh Popcorn Factory, Art of Steel, the European market, various street vendors and the biscotti shop. Even if you fasted, you wouldn't be able to try it all in one day. 

There are tons of food options from snacks to sit down restaurants. If I was local I would have such a great time experiencing all of the local wonders and flavors as well as take advantage of the fresh produce market which had incredibly low prices. 

I wish they'd close off the roadways in peak hours. There isn't much room to move on the sidewalks but there is also traffic so it's a struggle to get around, especially with a stroller. I wish there was a little more variety in shops because I can see it getting old year after year if there isn't variation.",4
Local Flavor,"Since moving from San Francisco to Pittsburgh, I've been struggling to buy once easy to find ingredients. It wasn't until a month in that I've discovered this lovely stretch of colorfully diverse shops and restaurants. It was love at first sight. 

It might be a tad difficult to navigate during the afternoon as cars tend to double park or drive really slow whilst their hunt for the much coveted parking spot. Although, there are a few places that offer parking lots for their guests. But, besides that, this place is well worth a visit if you're ready for a global food adventure. 

There are two aspects to the Strip District, the actual establishments that line the stretch of streets and the stands that dot the storefronts. My personal favorite are the food stands of course. Their offerings change according to the season. Winter brings roasted chestnuts and a variety of soups, whereas summer brings the savory aroma of grilled meats and freshly made banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich). 

I could go on and on about all my favorite stores, but I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise of unraveling this lovely place. So grab a friend or three, and explore what this amazing place has to offer!",4
Local Flavor,"Although Monroeville is local-ish, I am a total tourist when strolling The Strip!

I love the shops and never leave empty-handed (or hungry!!), but destination is not typically narrowed beyond ""The Strip"".  

Great art shops, many cultures, bustle? puts Miss Kitty to shame!, fantastic smells, seafood galore and 100% Pittsburgh.

My rating math is this:  6-stars minus one for parking!  Five it is--

Hoping that another benefit of empty-nest is becoming a Strip regular!  Wish me luck!",5
Local Flavor,"In town for baseball from Milwaukee.... Great way to spend and afternoon in Pittsburgh. Picked up delicious bread, a beautiful bracelet and awesome lunch. Highly recommend to anyone visiting.",4
Local Flavor,"I live in downtown - I have lived in downtown for over a year + now & I also work at the edge of the Strip District going into downtown... so the Strip District is VERY convenient for me to say the least.
I find the best variety for fresh food at great cheap prices all up & down the Strip District. My fiancé & I both have found that doing our grocery shopping here is MUCH cheaper/better/easier than going to Giant Eagle or any where else for that matter.
All the small business owners are super friendly, more than willing to help you, & once they start to recognize you as 'regular' will sometimes throw you some extra deals or some extras from time to time which is amazing.
I will tell you that it's VERY crowded on Fridays/Saturdays... so be prepared for that. Sundays aren't too bad crowd wise but if you want to visit here & not have any real crowds at all to deal with then go during Mondays/Tuesdays as these are the more dead days of the week.
Also, make sure you have SOME cash on you - not all vendors take cards - just a lil tip.",5
Local Flavor,"You cannot come to Pittsburgh and not explore these few streets that make up the Strip District. There are old style Italian markets, diverse eateries from every culture, and just lots of good coffee and fun shops to wander through. You need to see it, but come early and bring cash as not everyone accepts cards.",5
Local Flavor,"The strip district is an awesome place to live. I feel fortunate to call a trendy little loft in the strip my home.

Most people who are friends are considered more like family. Everyone is more than willing to lend a helping hand. Very close to the big city with small town vibes.

Great shopping at hand, easy access to exotic meats and cheeses. Tons of great little restaurants and places to grab a drink.",5
Local Flavor,"Pittsburgh Bound!  Part VI

I moved to Atlanta in December of last year from Pittsburgh and had yet to be back.  Virtually every Labor Day weekend of my entire life was spent in Pittsburgh with my parents, as my birthday falls within the window.  I promised my folks that I would make a long weekend out of it, and head on home.  The following reviews are a step-by-step account of the long weekend.  Enjoy!

(For part V, go to: http://www.yelp.com/review_share/XO8oVmObhdsGT1Blrby2-w/review/u9-OxNypeTIcnD6dBuLb9A?fsid=4oLsiunZ6p5Vz1h7XdLLXg)

A small section of Penn Ave., Smallman St., and Liberty Ave. make up the Strip District; an iconic marketplace that came to fruition in the early 1900's as a practical necessity in the heart of a steel town teeming with shift workers just looking for something to eat.

The Strip was initially a business hub with serious contenders placing offices within its confines.  US Steel, ALCOA, Westinghouse, and Heinz were all aligned down the street that boasted the best in local food wholesale, grocery stores, and restaurants.

Not much has changed in a century.  The Strip is still one of the hottest spots in the Burgh.  If you are going to Pittsburgh in the near future, make sure to carve out a slice of time to experience the sights, sounds, smells, and tastes that the Strip District has to offer.  Locals flock to the Strip on a weekly basis, and tourists who are checking it out will immediately notice that there isn't the least bit of a tourist-trap feel to it.  The Strip is a genuine culmination of local cuisine, epicurean diversity, and a place where there are few, if any ingredients, that aren't within a block's reach of wherever you are standing.

Meat purveyors, cheese mongers, and a variety of street vendors serve up such delicacies as pierogies, grilled chicken satay, raw oysters, and even homemade dog treats.  

I didn't need anything.  My mom didn't need anything.  But we knew that if I was in town, we were going to do what we always do when I'm home and wrestle through the throngs of people, knowing that even if we came home empty-handed, at least we experienced the minor chaos.

After two minutes of entering Wholey's I came to the realization that this is the first time in my entire life where I wasn't driving back to my home after visiting with my parents.  A first, I had to board a plane to go home to Atlanta, which created a severe limitation on what I could buy.  Whatever I got, I had to eat before I left which was perfectly fine with me.

The Strip District is definitely a place worthy of visiting when you're in town.

Local Flavor,"Love the Strip.  Whether you're a local, live in the city (like me) or from outta tahn, you will love the Strip District.  Open air shops, great eateries, and fantastic bars.  Come dahn on a Saturday or Sunday for the festival like atmosphere and excitement.",5
Local Flavor,"The Strip in Pittsburgh is awesome. Lots of vendors out on the street selling everything from clothes to souvenirs to Steelers merchandise. And it was all inexpensive!

The farmer's market was awesome and had unbeatable prices. If only I didn't have a 5-hour drive home, I would have bought a lot! 

For fans of anything Pittsburgh...go to the Strip to get loaded up with gear!!

Visited October 2014",5
Local Flavor,"The Strip is one of the best places in Pittsburgh to enjoy everything from fresh produce to concerts! One of my favorite shops there is Prestogeorge, where you can buy fresh coffee and tea leaves. Such clubs and bars that I enjoy are Cavo and Cruze, both of which have an inviting, unique atmosphere with a beautiful interior. Altar Bar, where I've attended numerous shows is sure to impress most. It brings an awesome ambiance to the strip with it's church based exterior and spacious, dark, gothic interior. The costume shop located in the Strip not only has a mural of super heroes and villains painted on the outside, but is so much fun to walk through year round and view the many costumes that the business carries and the characters that the place caters to! There are other various places including ""Peace, Love and Little Doughnuts"", Primanti Brothers, Wholey's Fish Market, a vet, Spaghetti Warehouse and a variety of unique storefronts and restaurants. You couldn't possibly visit the whole Strip District in one day! There is just too much to see! This is one of Pittsburgh's most unique outdoor strip malls with a variety of cultures melting into one area.",5
Local Flavor,"This is the spot to be early afternoon when you're in Pittsburgh. Any Pittsburgh sports clothing you are looking for is here for a decent price. The farmer's marketing is the reason I visit the Strip. I have found strawberries for $1! You can't beat those prices.

There are also boutqiues and other markets to browse through. Parking can be kind of a pain, but it is always worth it! The stores typically close early, but there is some nightlife. The Altar Bar, a popular music venue, has bands playing most nights.",4
Local Flavor,"If you have out of town visitors, the Strip District is one of the best parts of town to take them.  There is plenty to see and do and eat--so much that you can't expect to possibly experience it all in one day!  If you're a local, I'd recommend returning frequently to take advantage of all that this neighborhood has to offer!

The best part of the Strip is the local merchants and the unique and--for the most part, inexpensive--goods and eats.  If I lived closer, this is where I'd shop for groceries.  As it were, I come here mostly for the prepared food.  The eats range from inexpensive, quality street food (e.g., Edgar's Tacos, Lucy's) to reasonably-priced sit-down or self-serve lunches (e.g., Wholey's, Chicken Latino, Penn Ave. Fish Co.) to higher-end restaurants (Lidia's, Luke Wholey's, Kaya).  You can find tasty specimens of whatever type of food you're craving, whether it's pizza, pho, or pastries.  Be sure not to miss the PGH Public Market, which houses several vendors selling fresh, homemade food.  If you're more interested in liquid refreshments, be sure to check out the Strip's array of coffeehouses (La Prima Espresso, 21st St. Coffee), bars (Bar Marco, Harp & Fiddle, the BeerHive), and distilleries (Wigle Whiskey, PGH Winery, Maggie's Farm Rum). I've recently made the Strip a regular meal stop on my weekend bike rides around the city, and have enjoyed treating my tastebuds to the multitude of culinary treats that it offers. Additionally, I've begun exploring its breweries, and looking forward to checking out more of them. Finally, a trip to the Strip just wouldn't be complete without a stop at a bakery (Enrico, Colangelo's) or Klavon's Ice Cream Parlor, a vintage ice cream parlor and soda fountain, for a sweet treat.

If you're interested in shopping for food or ingredients, I'd recommend checking out the inexpensive, fresh produce at the Market Outlet and the Farmers @ Firehouse farmers' market, the authentic ethnic ingredients at Penn Mac and Lotus, and the spices at Penzey's. If you love sweets, be sure not to miss the candy stores (Mon Aimee and Grandpa's).  If you're more interested in checking out artisan goods, be sure to check out Art of Steel, the Allegheny Coffee and Tea Exchange, and, of course, the sportswear store.  And of course, be sure not to miss the Heinz History Center, a cultural gem of a museum full of historical artifacts presented in a fun, engaging way.

About the only thing not to love about the Strip is the crowds, which are especially heavy during the weekend, and the hectic parking (but see my tips).  They make for great people watching, however, so find an uncrowded spot and take advantage!",5
Local Flavor,"It's fun to venture here on a Saturday afternoon or a weekday when you played hookie from work :x There are very interesting stores and restaurants to be found here. I'd name then, but there are so many I cannot remember the names of all of the little stores that i love. I'll update sometime.",4
Local Flavor,"This is just a hard review to write, how do you sum up a neighborhood?  This could really be a two part review if you attempt to write about what it is like here in the daylight hours and what it is like in the night time hours.  The strip district truly has everything to make it a 24 hour destination.

For the daylight hours it is one hundred percent crazy.  I mean that with as much love as one can say about a Pittsburgh institution.  This place is busy.  Not just mingle busy, but beehive-in-full-defense-mode busy.  There are people everywhere.  Even when you think there isn't anybody there, just try stopping for a second to look at something.  One of two things will happen, you will be bumped into repeatedly, or there will be a line forming behind you.  People have no regard for traffic here either, but the traffic is totally respectful to people that want to get across the street to get a buy.

Everything you can imagine to buy is available for you here.  From popcorn to tennis shoes, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  I have been here on multiple occasions and have not been able to hit up everything I wanted to.  Not because I don't have enough time to do it, but because I am just 1. too tired or 2. ran out of strength to carry items.  But not to fret, with this being a seven day a week happening, I can always come back.

Now the night time hours here are a little different.  It is packed.  When I say that, I mean every club, bar, concert venue, etc. is packed to the gill with people having a good time.  Don't forget the numerous restaurants this area has to offer.  The flavors offered here vary so much that every palate can easily be satisfied.  

I have spent many nights in the Strip with friends having a great time and making tons of memories.  Many nights ended up turning into morning before I knew it.  

With the new developments taking shape in the Strip I am sure that there are going to be many changes in how things work with parking and traffic.  But the one thing that won't change are the experiences that you will have here.  Well, maybe that will change a little bit, but not for the worse.  New venues will be added, that's what I'm trying to get at.",4
Local Flavor,"The Strip is one of my favorite places to visit to window shop for specialty foods and goods. Come here early on a Saturday and walk up and down the street, sampling street food, produce, and plenty of Pittsburgh sports gear. My favorite spots include Pennsylvania Macaroni Company, where you will find a vast supply of Italian imported goods along with gluten free and allergen free pastas, chocolates, and meats. Stop by Sam Bok, an Asian market that has a chicken-on-a-stick grill outside that also serves mung bean cakes and other Asian street foods. I have been going there for years and it is still an incredible treat. The Strip is also home to the original Primanti's sandwich shop location (fries, coleslaw, choice of meat, all on Mancini's delicious bread!), so if you are visiting Pittsburgh, stopping in is a must. 

You will also find my favorite concert venue in Pittsburgh, Altar Bar, in the Strip district, which is inside of an old church. If you're feeling old school, walk towards downtown and go to Eide's and browse old records, comic books, and collectibles.",5
Local Flavor,"The strip is an awesome place to go on the weekends! It's always very busy - even when it's 10 degrees outside lol - but that's because it's totally worth it! Whether you want miniature gourmet doughnuts, authentic ethnic foods, an enormous variety of craft beers, street food, beautiful scarves, cute jewelry, or even a ""tobacco pipe"" ;), this is the place to go!! We always have so much fun when we go down here...just make sure you bring your walking shoes!!",4
Local Flavor,"The Strip is a great place to walk through--there are so many shops and stands selling all kinds of things (groceries, books, clothing, accessories, food...), and the large crowds make everything so exciting and lively. I love to stop by on Saturday afternoon for the craft fair, where local artists sell their work. My favorite is silverware that's been repurposed into wind chimes and jewelry. This is one of my favorite places to visit when the weather is nice I have a few hours to spend, but I definitely need to spend many more weekends here to see everything.",4
Local Flavor,"The Strip District is amazing and the prices are reasonable. I think going their in April is the best time to go because it wasn't crowded when I went and it was easy to find parking spots. I've been a Pitt fan for 27 years and I didn't see a lot of Panther clothes, jersey's, etc, but I'm sure if I go during Pitt football season, I will find some. I'll try to go back when I visit Pittsburgh, again. Amazing city!!!",5
Local Flavor,"Walk a mile in my shoes and you'll end up at the The Strip District ! (^.^)/~~~

It's no secret....the Strip might be the best thing about Pittsburgh....A lively produce market by day....a busy club scene at night...a visit the strip is not to be missed during my stay here in Pittsburgh ...been here multiple times! And loved every moment of it...its a A short walk from downtown as well ! this area never gets dull! enjoyyyy",5
Local Flavor,"I love the strip district. I love walking, looking, smelling. It is everything and has everything Pittsburgh. There is plenty of parking (if you are willing to walk a few blocks) and there is so much to see. All of the street vendors and all the little mom and pop places that have been here for ages make an awesome feast for your senses. There are always lots of people (good for people watchers) and lots to taste. The flowers being sold are beautiful and the view of downtown (or as we say it dahntahn) is just extraordinary. If you are looking for something to do on a Saturday morning, come here. Always a fun time!",5
Local Flavor,"Everyone told me about the Strip District. 

Just keep in mind after 4pm a lot of shops and businesses start to close. Yes no joke. I got here by 6pm and pretty much everything was closed. The street was dead and it seems like the actual Strip District (Penn Ave) is just a few blocks. If you walk further down then you end up in no where.",3
Local Flavor,"Easy on the eye, plenty of fancy places to dine and when accompanied by the evening sun glimmering off the water, Leith Docks is a picturesque image to behold. 

The scene is not that dissimilar to the typical canal laden Dutch town.... ok, that's a little farfetched but from certain angles the water side restaurants and cafe's paint an attractive picture.

You'll find some shoddy looking areas within Leith, and some quaint little hotspots....Leith docks definitely is akin to the latter.",4
Local Flavor,"Leith is the sort of place that I imagine Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts to stroll around in the movie Notting Hill. It's so lovely and soaked with history. The old, warehouse-style buildings make trendy apartments and the lined walkways are lovely.
It can be a bit of a nuisance to get down to, especially if you're only going down for a walk - as I often am. But once you get there, it's worth the journey.

Leith is in the middle of a regeneration project, the 'We Love Leith' signs are everywhere, to try to encourage people to come out and walk around. Although this is a good thing, part of me doesn't want more people around because it's so special just the way it is.",4
Local Flavor,"Everyone needs a good thinking place. Sometimes a quiet bar is good, sometimes just your own bedroom. But there's no better thinking spot than Leith Docks. You can sit on a bench and look out to the Waters of Leith and just contemplate. I stayed here for approximately an hour and a half looking weird. But I did do a lot of thinking. Maybe too much.

If you're not a big thinker (more of a doer) then there are loads of bars and restaurants round here. I'd recommend Loch Fyne, which is a great, locally sourced seafood place set in an old boat house. In fact, I reviewed it on here if you're interested. There's also the Royal Yacht Britannia for the culture cravers (it's really worth a visit actually) and it's just a very pleasant place to be on a sunny afternoon. And remember, it's not being alone, it's being 'with yourself'. It's weird then. Is it?",4
Local Flavor,"Want to feel like a indy film actor? Need space to clear your head? Have a craving for good food? The Leith Shore is your go to place. Spacious, quaint, quiet and many places to relax or eat. I normally check in the mornings as I get my bus from here. Brilliant sunrises. Also when dusk sets in the lights are amazing. I say: relax and enjoy.",4
Local Flavor,"Commercial Quay is a neat little strip hosting a world class restaurant (Kitchen), swanky bars and other notable eateries.  

The fountains, sea air and general clean and crisp design of the place is a tempting attraction away from Edinburgh's central area, and if caught on a summers evening, can look pretty special.

Visiting places like this, even though I live in Edinburgh, gives me a sense of being on holiday and for this I thanks places like Commercial Quay. 

Worth a peak.",4
Local Flavor,"I hadn't been to Commercial Quay before and wasn't very optimistic about it. I thought it was just going to be a place full of businesses, bog standard restaurants and shops. How wrong was I! 

My walk along Commercial Quay was a real eye opener. It is full of nice bars, shops, a hair dresser and restaurants. It even is home to one of Scotland's best restaurants, the Kitchin. This restaurant has been awarded a Michelin star, somewhere I must try in the future. 

All the places looked modern and quite swanky, so I would imagine the style of these places comes at a price. However, when I was walking through the quay, the sun was shining and the tables were out with people basking in the sun while drinking a chilled drink. 

Very close to Ocean Terminal, this area certainly provides stiff competition to the restaurants and bars in the terminal. 

Great place to chill, and a great place to go for a stroll.",4
Local Flavor,"Zen. This place has a small but wonderful selection of bars & restaurants. Kitchin, Chop Chop and Bond 9 are my personal favourites - There is also an International Starters and Mya (Indonesian/Thai) restaurant. A furniture shop and a hairdresser. 
It overlooks the Scottish Government building. 
The little cobbled lanes flanked by a water feature with fountains is a very tranquil place to be during the summer - it has virtually the sun the whole day! Pleasantly tucked away from heavy traffic on the busy commercial street on the other side. 

If you are looking to have a little rest from it all go to this area and you are transported into a quiet corner of Leith, just minutes away from the Shore and the Ocean Terminal Shopping Centre.",4
Local Flavor,"Named after the days when cattle used to herded down the street to be sold in Edinburgh's market, Cowgate now hosts a handful of bars,  pubs and clubs. 

The street itself can be somewhat gloomy, especially in the evening as you approach the looming overhead George IV bridge. This dark and dingy setting adds to the character of Cowgate, but doesn't exactly make it the safest place to wander either.

Don't let this deter you too much from visiting Cowgate, it's still a unique and interesting location.",4
Local Flavor,"When you first have a look around Cowgate, I wouldnt blame you if you wrote it off right away, especially if you went at night.

Hidden away inder the much, much grander George IV bridge, this relic of old Edinburgh is constantly in shadow, as it is in the bowels of the city, surrounded by buildings and the rest of the city above it.

However, once you start to look around - you will notice that life can thrive down here, as well as a vast number of pubs and clubs - some of the best in the city.

So yes, its dark, dindgy and can seem dangerous, but really its a social hub in Edinburgh, buzzing with life.",4
Local Flavor,"When my mum tells me not to walk home at night, it is this specific area she's talking about! It can get really dark and dingy and really quite haunting!! Put it this way - the haunted tours in Edinburgh are set around the Cowgate.

There isn't much here from September - July, but it comes alive in August! One of the main tents is here for the festival so it always buzzing.  It is the best way to walk into the Grassmarket though because you get that tingly feeling when everything opens up around you.",3
Local Flavor,"Hidden away, in the depths of the old town is the area known as Cowgate. 

Since, its cattle market days, this area has moved on to become one of Edinburgh's most well known and popular night club districts! Pubs and clubs are spread about the entire length of this area including the Hive, Bannermans, Siglo, Cab. Voltaire, Opium and the Three Sisters! 

The area can be dark and gloomy and as mentioned in previous reviews, that matches part of the atmosphere of the area. A lot of the clubs and bars are quite gloomy at times. Indeed, walking down this place at night is not one would walk alone either. 

This area is always buzzing at the weekends and does have a reputation, which is why police cars consistently patrol the area. However, don't be put off by this, Cowgate is worth a visit and is very popular with students!",3
Local Flavor,"As far as areas of Edinburgh go, I have a love-hate relationship with Cowgate. Hidden under George IV bridge, and stretching from the Grassmarket to Pleasance, it is at once a cheeky guilty pleasure and a somewhere I sometimes want to avoid.

It reminds me of when I was 18, drinking cheap vodka-cokes in the student union, then getting up to all sorts of general tomfoolery at 2am. Which is exactly what you can do here. 

During the day it's simply a slightly out-the-way large street, with some hostels, some bars and not much else. At night it turns into a drunken carnival of relatively good-natured but still, drunk, students, locals and tourists pilling in and out of Bannerman's bar, Banshee Labyrinth, Sneaky Pete's and Opium.

So when I want a night of cheap drink in bars that smell like bodies and bodily smells, a right good reliving of my youth at Opium and then either some chips and cheese or a slice of pizza from Zara, this is where I'll go.

The good: Brew Dog and Bannerman's, Oz Bar for pool, and Under the Stairs for cocktails. The bad: Banshee Labyrinth and Sin. The ugly: the drunken crowd that hang around outside Zara's pizza place at 2am.",3
Local Flavor,"Clubs, Bars and Hostels 
A college kid's night out dream
Weekends are crazy",2
Local Flavor,"One of my favourite areas for a night out. Cowgate is prediominantly in place for backpackers, students and chavs to take advantage of a cheap night out. Students tend to stick to flat parties or Potterrow, so usually it's the backpackers and chavs doing the rounds.

There's also a large emo/goth contingent down to the presence of Opium and Sneaky Pete's, but on the whole the varying cliques that populate the Cowgate on a weekend keep to themselves.

Clubs come in the form of Whistle Binkies and Cab/Cafe Voltaire. All worth a look. The teeny boppers have Bar Rush and the Hive, so that's them out the way. Meaning the rest of us have a decent selection of night-time venues to choose from.

Worthy of note are the aforementioned Opium and Binkies, along with City Cafe, Globe and Banshee Labyrinth.

If you're after a fancy, glamorous night out, Cowgate is your Kryptonite. Stay away! However if you're looking for cheap beverages, relaxed locales and general random banter, there aren't many better options than here.",4
Restaurants,"We went here attracted to the grand opening banner that advertised $1 hot dogs and $2 burgers.  That sounded yummy, so we decided to check it out.  Pulling up I noticed they advertised real charcoal grilling and sure enough they cook everything to order on a charcoal grill behind the counter.   We were not asked how we wanted the items cooked, but the man cooking the food had been interacting with us, so I asked him to make my two hot dogs well done and he made the perfectly.  The toppings for the hot dogs and burgers looked fresh.  We ordered the macaroni and cheese which was also delicious.  I really wasn't expecting much other than a plain ole' hot dog, but it was really, really good.  We enjoyed the TV's that were playing, they are excellent quality and the world cup was on.",5
Restaurants,"Good burgers, great fries, kid-friendly food, and cheap cheap cheap! Every neighborhood should have a good go-to burger joint. Is it the best burger in the valley? No, but I can't afford to feed my family at Deluxxe every other Friday. I can totally afford to take them here, and they have grilled cheese and mac and cheese for my picky kids. And the fries are awesome.",5
Restaurants,"We started off here, by going to Maui Dog, which was closed due to an 8am burglary. Then we tried to keep the Hawaiian theme, and decided to go to Ono Hawaiian Grill. But upon walking into Ono and being overwhelmed by a sewage smell, we quickly turned around and walked in to On the Grill.

I went with the Chicken and Apple Sausage (which was a nice find because so few places will carry this). The sausage was tasty, and the condiments (lettuce, tomato, relish, etc..) all seemed to be fresh and presented nicely. The Fries were good as well. Nothing over the top here, just pretty good food. No complaints from me. The staff was very friendly, and jovial. I will go back if I'm ever in the neghborhood.",4
Restaurants,"Really good place to eat. Burgers are good and the sandwiches too. Their hot dogs are grilled not steamed, way better that way.  The owner is real a real hospitable, friendly guy.",4
Local Flavor,"From certain angles the Quartermile can make for an idyllic scene in contrast to the dreary buildings found in the nearby Bristo square area.

A reliable Starbucks, Sainsbury's and more fancy Peter's Yard equate to a solid place for milling around during any lunch break.

Just watch out for the odd cyclist racing past, you don't want your almond croissant and Americano to splatter all over your crisp polo shirt.",4
Local Flavor,"I fell in love with all the Quarter-mile apartments as soon as I saw them...and when I got inside then whoa!!! Hold me back!!

They mix the old with the new and have done it really well. Although it seems to have been on the go for years now, never seemingly finished! A friend told me there will be around 900 appartments in total, which is crazy. When it's finished it will be amazing!!

The flats themselves are quite expensive, but will be worth it in the long run as I fully believe it will regain its value.

They are STUNNING appartments though, worth a look!",5
Local Flavor,"I have quite a few friends who're Edinburgh locals, who, when they see this building (i.e. everytime they walk past this building) get kinda outraged. I mean, they grew up with the Royal Infirmary, which was torn down, or as the case may be, revamped, into luxury apartments. Hospital to luxury apartments. Hospital to luxury apartments. Does this not sound kind of wrong to you?

Apart from that, I just don't see the buildings' appeal. They're all glass and shiny and completely out of context. The only thing that keeps me from giving this place one star is that it is the home of Peter's Yard and I. Am. Hopelessly. Addicted. To their lattes. This was my friend's fault. For at least a year I stayed away from the Quartermile. Because I had some strange sense of principle. But then my friend made me taste the latte. And oh my.

But back to the actual Quatermile: these buildings are just plain incongruous.",2
Local Flavor,"The Quartermile is one of my favourite places in Edinburgh. Connecting the Meadows to Forrest Road, this walking and cycling path is constantly buzzing with activity. 

Over the last couple of years the Quartermile has gone under some renovations with new flat being made where the old hospital was. Also, there is now a Sainsbury's, a Starbucks and a Swedish cafe called Peter's Yard. 

These additions to the area has made this area very busy during everybody's' lunch hour, especially with school children and students. However, during the evening sometimes there are some musicians who play into the night, including those who play the violin and saxophone! Very nice when walking home on an Autumn's evening! 

At the bottom of the path at the Meadow's end is the most well known Big Issue seller in Edinburgh. He is always there in the mornings and always has a cheery word to say. You will get to know him if your someone who walks through the Meadows daily.",4
Local Flavor,"They say familiarity is what leads to attraction. And perhaps this is why I feel so warmly towards the Quartermile. Living on the other side of the Meadows, I pass through it daily on my way to town. And I often spend a lot of time here.

For a start, it looks beautiful. The large open terrace area in front of Peter's Yard, Sainsbury's and Starbucks catches the afternoon sunlight beautifully. The small stone benches are always full of people sitting, enjoying lunch. There are bikes chained up around it, dogs tied and barking for their owners. Even in the winter, people huddle under blankets outside enjoying a hot chocolate.

It's still under construction (barely, though) around the back. Amongst the apartments there's a new Malaysian restaurant, an independent book shop - Looking Glass Books - and it leads to Pure Gym out the back.

There's not a LOT here but that's nice. It's perfectly proportioned. The apartments above the main block are kept nicely. It's a really clean area too. Despite the very large volume of people, mainly students, flitting over the smooth paved terrace, there isn't a scrap of litter. Bravo Edinburgh Council on that one.

It's beautiful to look at, with the Meadows stretching beyond it. In the summer, especially during the Festival in August, bands and buskers set up along the stretch of path, so you could pass an impromptu Lindy Hop dance, or cycle by a saxaphone player. There's also the resident man-in-a-gorilla-suit playing the drums. Adorable when all the children get excited and he lets them have a go.

Quartermile is one of my favourite places in Edinburgh. It looks beautiful, and yeah the shops and cafés are a bit pricier, it's not even for what is offered here. It's just how it looks, the atmosphere, the open space that is kept clean and fresh. I can sit in a café, have a coffee, go to the gym over lunch, find another café to have an afternoon cake in, then pick up my groceries before heading home over the Meadows. Perfect.",5
Local Flavor,"I'm excited to see what the Quatermile turns into. When they were building it I trespassed and made my way up to the top of one of the penthouses when it was just a concrete shell and the views from up there are awesome. Not that I could ever afford to be up there now of course! 

I think that this entire area has so much potential but it needs investment to keep it moving onwards and upwards. Peters Yard is a great addition and we need more places like this and less like starbucks and sainsburys to make this an amazing place to spend time. There is some cool buildings out there which could house some awesome half bar/half workspace type places. This would be awesome. 

The offices there are starting to take shape too with Skyscanner being in the main building and a wealth management organisation on another floor. I'd like to see more new companies ending up here. 

It's definately somewhere to keep your eyes on!",4
Local Flavor,"The saying goes, that if you walk directly over the Heart of Midlothian, you will never find true love. I walked over it nonchalantly the other day, and was shouted at for apparently stepping straight into the superstitious jaws of bad luck. I could well be cursed for life now, however I've walked under quite a few ladders and probably also broken a mirror in my time too, so I don't suppose a love curse is going to affect matters that much.

The Heart of Midlothian marks a spot where there used to be executions, and somehow this translates into the not classy in any way practice of spitting on the heart for good luck. Never mind the curse of never finding true love if you step on the heart, what about the dirty fact that you're walking over the liquid contents of other people's mouths? If you spit on the heart, legend also has it that this means you'll return to Edinburgh, much like throwing a coin into the Trevi Fountain in Rome, but not nearly as scenic. 

Anyway, if you want to find this heart shaped Royal Mile decoration, it's near St Giles High Kirk and Parliament House. It gets a three, purely because I really dislike spitting in public, call me uptight.",3
Local Flavor,"The only reason I'm not getting all excited about the rating is that, 1) no-one's feelings will get hurt and 2) I generally dislike inanimate things that have crowds of tourists creating a blockade between me and my destination. This include Greyfriar's Bobby (it's all a lie, by the way!). 

Also, I have hella superstitious friends. Friends who will physically push me away from three drains lined up (or something like that). Friends who will not let me walk on their other side, because you're not supposed to cross over them or something ridiculous like that. Friends that spit on the Heart of Midlothian every single time they walk passed it. These friends are of the few people I know from Edinburgh. And so they've probably been doing this for 21 years. Them and many more. This is only one reason I'm not particularly interested in the Heart of Midlothian. 

But hey, it's one of those places that's free and you'll probably walk by it anyway, so maybe if you're feeling glum, you should give it a good spit for good luck. But, please try aiming accurately.",3
Local Flavor,"I am actually part of on an ongoing controlled experiment into whether its true that the arcane powers of the Heart of Midlothian really do stop you from finding true love. I'll let you know how that goes.

The Heart of Midlothian is a famous sight of a 15th century tollbooth often used for public execution. Though that habit has more or less died out over the years, the ""Heart"" is still a victim of phony public scorn with the local habit of spitting on the site, still on the go.

Despite every tour leader and his wife stopping at this famous site, there isn't really much to see at the Heart of Midlothian. If you're the sort of person who needs their attractions to ""do stuff"" you'll probably be disappointed. The Heart of Midlothian just lies there being a bit stone. It's not beautiful or master craft stone-masonry either. But its free, it famous and you'll probably bump into it anyway.",3
Local Flavor,"I love this place. Go up to the heart of midlothian in the royal mile Edinburgh, It's about the only place in Edinburgh where you can spit. OK it's disguating but apparantly if you spit in it the story story has it you'll be lucky in love.",5
Local Flavor,"The heart of The Mile
a pleasant sight on a stroll
Spit for luck or not...",4
Local Flavor,"Me encantan las tradiciones, y yo soy muy de seguirlas todas. Mucho ojo con pasar por encima del Heart Of Midlothian y no echarle un buen gargajo, porque la tradición dice que si lo haces, volverás a Escocia y encontrarás al amor de tu vida.

Así que no hagas oídos sordos y prepara un buen escupitajo en tu paseíllo por la Royal Mile, porque allá donde fueres, haz lo que vieres.",5
Restaurants,"Ever wanted to go to Lambeau Field to watch a Green Bay Packer game but didn't want to freeze your ass off?  Well here ya' go!

EVERY Sunday (during the Packer season) this place is wall-to-wall Packer fans, 95% of them from Wisconsin.  Every wall is plastered with Packer memorabilia.  On every Packer score the place ERUPTS into complete mayhem!!!

Even the menu (and owner) is from Wisconsin.  Perch (it's a fish people) sandwiches, brats, Wisconsin cheese curds ... everything!  

They also sell just about anything that you can get a Packer logo onto!  I sh*t you not!  T-shirts, baby clothes, hats, sweaters and, yes those obnoxious cheeseheads to!  You name it they've got it in the Green & Gold with a big G on it!

Now for the bad news ... you MUST get there AT LEAST an hour prior to game time if you want a seat.

I'd never hang out here, outside of a Packer game ... but there's no place better to watch the Packers in the entire state of AZ.  

Welcome to Green Bay, Arizona!  

And Go Pack Go!",2
Restaurants,"The ultimate Packer fan's bar and grill in the middle of the desert.  This was an interesting bar to go into.  My uncle and I, while in Arizona for the Super Bowl, were told to go here because his friend is a Packer's fan and wanted a shirt.

We went in on Monday after the Super Bowl around noon.  We were the only people in here.  It was nice, in a way, as we were able to chat with the owner and bartender and enjoy our beer and meal in relative peace.  We also had ample opportunity to scope out the place and all of the memorabilia that was adorning the walls, the bar, the floor (i.e. EVERYWHERE).

They don't sell much in the form of souveniers save a simple over-priced t-shirt.  The beers were affordable and the food wasn't half bad.  Again, it's a bar not a restaurant, so don't expect much.  It was nice to stop in and if I were a Packer fan living in Phoenix, Arizona, I'd go here.

Interesting note, on Saturday night's it turns into a rap music night club.  From the rest of my review, something in this place seems off to have a night club here.  Oh well, the owner's gotta make money some how.  It was absolutely packed with a line around the corner when we tried to go that Saturday night (hence why we went Monday morning).",3
Restaurants,"Apparently Packer fans aren't Yelpers.. well the awesome ones are (Dave B. and I). I'd like to start off by saying that I was expecting to give Mabel Murphys a 5 star review as the best place to watch a Green Bay game in the Valley, possibly all of the southwest after going there for Packers/Vikings game yesterday.

However, I never saw the game there, and therefore, can't say that.

For anyone that's a Packers fan that hails from Wisconsin, you should have a picture in your mind of the classic Wisconsin sports bar - Packers memorabilia EVERYWHERE, Leinenkugels aplenty, cheese curds on the menu, that surprisingly homey feel, lots of screaming and fanaticism.

Typically this is Mabel Murphys. My first visit there was for the Bears/Packers Monday night game last year and it was complete mayhem, and I wouldn't have had it any other way. The typical ""fight songs"" played at Lambeau are played during commercial breaks and screamed by the fans. You can't find anyone in there not sporting their green and gold and it's hard to find a seat or standing spot unless you are there an hour or more ahead of time. It screams home for all of us that left the frozen tundra.

However, I think one hazardous flaw was made this year. They closed for renovation and nothing on their website hinted at anything of the sort. Therefore, people that don't head to Old Town all the time and come those few times a year for the games where being with your own kind is of importance had no idea unless they would've tried to call, and who calls to make sure a Packers bar is open the night they play the Vikings with Favre adorned in purple? Nevertheless, I arrived an hour before the game to find out they weren't open an that nearly a dozen people also did not get the memo. The construction worker there had no suggestions of where to go and there was no note on the door from management. They said they had been having people stop by all day asking, and had no suggestions.

I missed pre game due to having to drive to another bar. Mabel Murphys really disappointed me last night. I really hope they can make up for it. Never get on the bad side of a Packer fan and never deny them of their game. I've never been more sad about a Yelp review than now.",3
Restaurants,"Great restaurant. This is a charming little bring your own wine restaurant with fantastic food at very reasonable prices. I've been to this restaurant about 30 times, and I've never been disappointed. The food is good and the service is great too. I only wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.",4
Restaurants,"Coup de coeur définitif!!! Un apportez votre vin, tout petit mais qui offre tant!!! J'ai essayé leur bavette au beurre de foie gras et truffes, WOW, impressionant! Mais surtout, réservez d'avance! c'est fort populaire et il n'y a pas beaucoup de places!!! Plus de détails et des photos sur mon blog bientôt!!!",4
Restaurants,"This place is serving food that is orgasmic. The quality and dishes are wonderful. It was here I first tried beef tartar and it was amazing... Full of flavor!! I actually craved it afterwards. I've also tried the duck risotto, veal, crab cakes... The list goes on and on. It's right down the street, BYOW and great quality?? What more can I ask for? A DEFINITE ""must go"" if you're in the area!!",5
Restaurants,"Resto bruyant. J'ai pris le tartare de saumon en entrée et c'était délicieux. Nous avons tous eu un potage à la courge qui était très bon mais tiède. Mon plat principal était vraiment ordinaire, linguini bisque de homard et morilles.. Plat tiède, sans goût,très décevant!!!",2
Restaurants,"All the dishes we had were outstanding. The highlights included the scallop and blood sausage appetizer, potato soup, salmon tartar, crispy veal and smoked cheese, along with the chocolate mousse. In addition our servers were friendly, knowledgeable and on top of things. A sensational neighborhood restaurant!",5
Restaurants,"Je reste sur mes 4 étoiles car je vais être obligée d'y retourner tant la carte m'a enchantée et mon plat également. Pour peut-être lui offrir sa 5eme étoile :)

Il s'agit d'un petit restaurant type Bistrot, à la Française, intime et  cosy. C'est un ""apporter votre vin"", donc penser à prendre votre bouteille (ou bien traversez la rue, un dépanneur vous sauvera la mise).

En plus d'une carte très alléchante, le plat du jour l'était aussi : du homard poché dans du beurre sur sa fondue de poireau. Un délice. Un prix plus que correct. Monsieur a pris la viande, et elle était fondante en bouche, saignante à point. J'ai longuement hésité avec les tartares (boeuf et saumon), raison de plus pour y revenir :)
Puis pour conclure, une panacotta divine (on ne se refait pas !), compact ce qu'il faut, sous sa crème de caramel. J'en suis encore toute émoustillée !

Puis je tiens à préciser et relever que le service a été plus qu'excellent : un serveur très chaleureux, plein d'humour et de conseils. Nous avons même eu un petit potage en entrée offert car ma famille venait d'arriver ! Quel service !",4
Restaurants,"Everything was delicious.  My taste buds were popping with flavours.  Excellent service.  Only hic, we were crammed like sardines but the food made up for it.  Highly recommend!",4
Restaurants,Excellente bouffe même si le cadre est normal. Un apportez votre vin abordable et avec un bon service. En entrée les raviolis aux épinards sont a s'en mordre les doigts.,5
Restaurants,Un petit coin bien caché mais avec des plats délicieux.  Que se soit l'agneau le veau ou les raviolis le chef seras vous surprendre avec une cuisine raffiné et savoureuse qui denote avec l'endroit a la decoration sommaire. Un tres bon resto a faire entre collègues ou amis au tour d'une bonne bouteille de vin.,5
Restaurants,"So I went to this BYOW for my birthday..... And I was never served so horribly in my life. It all started when I asked for croutons for my tartare, the server said they didn't have enough bread and that's why they didn't give us much while we were waiting. I told them that tartare without croutons is not very good, they didn't care, after arguing they brought back plain bread. I asked if it could be toasted or put in the oven on broil to make them crispy. The server started yelling at me but them came back with some weird toasted bread..... After everyone was done eating their plate. I said I'm sorry but it's kinda too late.... I was never screamed like that in my whole life by anyone. My friends started getting into it and both servers were screaming and insulting me and my friends. Note that the manager was not there on a busy Saturday night. They didn't even wanna bring a piece of cake for my birthday but my sister argued with them and they finally did but charge her 9$ for the slice of cake. I can't believe they charged my plate which I didn't touch, plus the slice of cake and they never apologize or threw in something to make up for the way they treated me..... All my friends felt so bad for me cause it was my birthday..... 
I am never ever going there and so are all 15 of my friends that where attending my birthday supper.",1
Restaurants,"La tarte fine au boudin maison était un délice. Délicate, légère et fraîche. Elle laisse un souvenir impeccable. Le tartare de bœuf était savoureux et le frites qui l'accompagnait avaient ce qu'il faut comme texture. La crème brûlée au café était un peu trop froide à mon goût. J'aurais aimé qu'elle soit plus à température de la pièce. Service impeccable",4
Restaurants,"Je suis allée 2 fois au Mr B, la première fois ce fut une belle expérience le tartare de Saumon est délicieux! Le restaurant est très petit nous étions assis juste a cote de la cuisine il fessait chaud. Le fait que ce restaurant est apportez votre vin et que le menu offre des choix style bistro français sont 2 points positif pour moi. Pour se quo est de la deuxième fois tout autre histoire nous sommes allés pour la fête à mon amie et dès que nous sommes rentrés le mauvais service à commencé; la serveuse était méchante et très impatiente! Un des serveur a même crié après mon amie car elle voulait des croûtons avec son tartare se qui n'offrait pas. Donc deuxième expérience extrêmement décevante je n'ai aucune intention d'y retourner.",1
Restaurants,"Le service est chouette, la bouffe est bonne... La joue était excellente, le foie gras juste MALADE! Quelques plats un peu en dessous, une installation moyennement confortable (5 sur une table de 4) et la serveuse qui oublie les bougies et factures qu'on lui avait demande en mode anniversaire font que je m'arrête a 4 etoiles ... mais j'y retournerai!",4
Restaurants,"My girlfriend and I went here with another couple last week. Two of us ordered the $50 six service menu, and the other two ordered a la carte. Everything we tried was delicious. The pork chop I got as a main course was extremely flavorful and much bigger than I expected. Another highlight was the salmon tartare. 

The trou normand was a bit odd - a scoop of rhubarb sorbet in a glass of vodka. My girlfriend was turned off by the vodka, but while I'm not normally a vodka fan, I found the flavors complemented each other extremely well and I really enjoyed it. As a reasonably priced BYOW restaurant with great food, I'll definitely be back here. It will be a future favorite for date nights, I'm sure.",4
Restaurants,"One of the greatest food experiences in my life (and I'm a foodie). My boyfriend brought me to Monsieur B to celebrate our new, yet deep, love. The waiter, Julien, was the friendliest foodie I've seen (he didn't make any statement, but there's no way he isn't, according to how he talked about the menu). There was so many good suggestions that I asked him to guide me, which he did perfectly, as if he was reading my soul. 

The starters were tasty, I had a salmon tartar and my boyfriend had that huge crush on the foie gras, which almost had me doubt about how much love he is capable of. The trou normand, a scoop of Les Givrés' grapefruit sorbet with a vodka splash, was delicious and refreshing. It had us renew our love for each other. 

My man had rabbit as a main dish and I almost clapped when Julien explained me what was on my plate. I never had anything called Surf and Turf before, but I'll definitely try it again I happen to read in on a menu. There was tuna, there was beef, there was love. With a side of asian slaw, well marinated, with toasted peanuts (I never thought peanuts could be that fancy). While eating the main dish, we didn't really talk. Some serious tasting was going on.

Their panna cotta had a solid reputation. We almost went for something else just to try, but we decided to both go for their classic and we weren't disappointed, far from it. At that point, we were somewhere very high without the help of any cloud, although the wine (BYO) might have helped somehow. 

Please go if you can, I believe there's no way to regret your choice. 
And to anyone giving a bad review to Monsieur B: I think you are a liar/jealous/hidden competitor.

Thank you,

- A Juliette in love.",5
Restaurants,"Souper des fêtes trop de gens autour de la même table. Pourquoi essayer à tout prix de mettre autant de gens dans un si petit lieu. Ça détruit le plaisir et ça donne pas le goût d'y retourner un autre jour. 

Beaucoup trop de monde dans un petit espace. Le repas était correct mais sans plus. 1 etoiles",1
Restaurants,"$75, 7-course NYE dinner. Food was quite good - some dishes mediocre (rabbit), some delicious (mushroom risotto, chocolate pot). Service was so-so (one server was very personable, second was not). Water glasses not refilled until meal's end. 

My biggest complaint was that while the first 3 courses came to our table with only a few minutes in-between, the subsequent courses were separated by about 20 minutes each, too long for such small servings in my opinion. Overall, from first to last course we were there for 2.5 hours. 

In the end we were satisfied but not impressed. Maybe we'll try it again on a regular menu night.",3
Restaurants,"I gad a fantastic birthday celebration with friends here. The atmosphere was perfect for our group and the service was great. I highly recommend the salmon tartar (it  was incredible!). I also had a butternut squash gnocchi and brownie for dessert, both of which were delicious.",5
Restaurants,"Franz Klöfer ist ein Genussmensch wie aus dem Lehrbuch. Der Mann kocht vorzüglich, kennt sich mit Wein und Schnaps aus wie kaum ein anderer, besitzt eines der geschmackvollsten Restaurants der Südpfalz, hat eine sichere Hand in Sachen Kunst, die er in seinen Räumen perfekt platziert und ist, schließlich und endlich, ein Patron der alten Schule, gelegentlich ruppig und raunzig, aber immer ehrlich und solide.
Wir waren Dutzende Male in Frans Klöfer's ""Gasthaus Einigkeit"" in Wörth-Maximiliansau. Dort liegt der kleine Flachbau in einer ruhigen Nebenstraße ohne Durchgangsverkehr. Wer das Haus betritt, wird sofort von der Atmosphäre des hellen Hauptraums gefangen. Gekalkte Decke, helle Möbel, viele Fenster. An der Hauptwand der Blickfang: ein Triptychon ""Stiere"", drei gewaltige Gemälde, klares Signal für Klöfers besondere Liebe zu Spanien. Die Tische selbstverständlich perfekt weiß, vorzügliche Gläser, gute Cutlerware. Ein Nebenraum mit einem wundervollen Achter- und einem erstklassigen Sechsertisch, und daran anschließend noch ein Raum, weiß, auch hier viele Antiquitäten und geschmackvolle Kunst an den Wänden. Das ganze Haus ist durchgängig stilsicher, dazu gehört auch eine massige Batterie erlesener Schnäpse, die in keiner Karte aufgelistet, aber von Klöfer selbst oder seinem vorzüglichen Restaurantleiter Viktor und dessen Crew mit fachkundiger Sicherheit beschrieben werden. Das gilt auch für sämtliche Positionen der gewaltigen Weinkarte - bestens sortiert die gehobene Pfalz, aber natürlich auch Spanien, Frankreich, Italien. Wer sich aber seiner Bestellung nicht sicher genug fühlt, lässt sich entweder beraten oder greift gleich zu einem der zahllosen offenen Angebote, die ständig wechseln. Wir genießen glasweise, wobei Viktor am Ende des Abends mit geübtem Blick abschätzt, wie viel durch Glas und Kehle gegangen ist. Solch generöse Behandlung gab es selbst in der guten alten Zeit nicht an jeder Ecke, aber heute ist sie so selten geworden, dass Gäste diese Behandlung immer wieder mit ungläubigem Staunen quittieren.
Franz Klöfer schreitet, nachdem die handgeschriebene Karte, der Gruß aus der Küche und das exzellente, lauwarme Brot samt hausgemachtem Schmalz, Quark und Oliven an den Tisch geliefert wurden, zu seinen Gästen und nimmt die Bestellungen eigenhändig auf. Er gibt dezente Hinweise, und es lohnt sich, dem Chef genau zuzuhören, wenn er etwas mit einer winzigen Randbemerkung oder einem erfreuten ""Aha"" kommentiert. Ist er gut drauf, greift er schon mal zur Flasche und probiert, was der Gast im Glas hat. Ist er nicht selbst zufrieden, wird die Flasche ausgetauscht.
Was dann eine halbes Stündchen später aus der Küche kommt, ist schon deshalb ungewöhnlich, weil es grundsolide und bestens gelungen ist. Zum Beispiel die aktuellen Vorseisen - eine Cassoulet aus Hummer und Kalbsbries (28 Euro), ein fabelhafter Lachtartar mit einer Haube aus Creme Fraiche und geziert mit Kaviar (18 Euro), oder eine Suppe aus Steckrüben (12 Euro) mit einer Fülle überaus selbstbewusster Aromen.
Die aktuellen Hauptgänge füllen in kräftiger Handschrift eine Seite im Menu - mehr als sechs sind es nicht. Doch da fiel uns bei unserem letzten Besuch eine ganz leichte Nachlässigkeit der Küche auf, die an diesem Abend nicht auf jenem Niveau spielte, das sie sonst erreicht: Wir sprechen hier, nicht zu vergessen, von einer Küchenleistung in unmittelbarer Sterne-Nachbarschaft - der Gault Millau bewertet Franz Klöfer mit 15 Punkten und 2 Hauben. So kam das Lammcarree (28 Euro), rustikal auf grünen Böhnchen und begleitet von fein gerösteten Kartöffelchen, etwas fett und flexig, der begleitende Fond brav, aber nicht sensationell. Ähnlich das Boeuf Bourguignon (26 Euro), jener hochgeschätzte und berühmteste aller französischen Eintöpfe, der in Fleischqualität und Geschmack überzeugte, aber in der Konsistenz ein wenig an ein braves deutsches Goulasch gemahnte. Auf Fischseite dagegen lieferte die Küche einen perfekt auf der Haut gebratenen Skrai (26 Euro), wundervoll im Biss und vorzüglich im Geschmack. Das Kalbskotelett (24 Euro) hingegen haben wir in der ""Einigkeit"" schon in jener Klasse gegessen, die den Gast hemmungslos zum Weinen bringt. Das hat es diesmal nicht geschafft, obgleich - bleiben wir fair - selbst die kleinen Fehler beim Garen das feine Stück immer noch lange nicht hinrichten.  
Die Dessertkarte ist ruhig und preislich überaus fair gehalten, viele geschmacklich anregende Sorbets, aufgefüllt mit dem Brand. Herausragend jedoch die alte, ewig jugendliche Creme Brulee. lauwarm und in außergewöhnlich sahniger Zubereitung, auf den Punkt karamelisiert und leicht geziert mit frischem Obst und einem Sorbet aus Apfel- und Birnenmus: Chapeau. Der Kaffee wird traditionsgemäß von frischem, selbstgebackenen Schoko-Rührkuchen begleitet. Ein würdiger Abschluß.
Von der gewaltigen Kollektion feinster Brände haben wir gesprochen. Und hierzu noch eine Anmerkung: dass ein Haus dem Gast völlig selbstverständlich anbietet, das köstliche Eau de Vie s...",5
Restaurants,"In Maximiliansau, das man kulinarisch als Karlsruher immer mit der Goggelburg verbindet, liegt das Gasthaus ein bisschen versteckt in einer Seitenstraße. Toller, alteingewachsener Hof mit kleinen Brunnen und unheimlich viel Charakter. Obwohl an unserem Besuchstag sehr heiß war und der Hof mit Plexiglas überdacht ist (den Raucher freuts) war es angenehm zu sitzen. Wir fühlten uns sofort pudelwohl. Der nette Ober brachte die handgeschriebene Speisekarte, die mit 8-9 Gerichten übersichtlich war, aber einem die Entscheidung nicht wirklich leicht machte. Wirklich super war der vorausgehende Gruß aus der Küche. Pfälzer Bohnensuppe, pikant, überraschend kalt und geschmacklich eine Sensation.  Dem heißen Wetter geschuldigt gab es dann einen Caprese und Tartar vom Angus und Lachs. Alles einwandfrei und geschmacklich gut, wenn auch kein Grund zu Freudensprüngen. Das Restaurant lebt von seinem Charisma und seiner außergewöhnlichen Atmosphäre. Bestes Beispiel als Karlsruher auf der RK Seite auch mal zur Pfalz runterzuscrollen. Es lohnt sich ! Punktabzug für das Nichtakzeptieren von gängigen VISA Karten.",5
Restaurants,"Wer in den letzten Wochen Franz Klöfer in seinem wunderbaren Restaurant ""Zur Einigkeit"" in Wörth besuchte, musste zwangsläufig gewisse Aktivitäten hinter den Kulissen bemerken. Und dann, in der letzten August-Woche, fiel der Vorhang, den der Chef und Gemahlin Juliane Klöfer sorgsam über ""Klöfer's Scheune"" gespannt hatten, um die Baustelle vor allzu neugierigen Blicken und Gästen zu schützen. Aber dann war es soweit: '""Klöfer's Scheune"" ist eröffnet, kein Zweitlokal, sondern ein aufregend hübscher, kleiner Laden, in dem Juliane Klöfer Produkte verkauft, die Franz Klöfer in seiner hochklassigen Küche herstellt. Dazu hat der clevere Gastgeber und Koch, wie er selbst sagt, ""die Konserve neu für sich und für uns alle"" entdeckt. Er füllt in Gläser und Dosen, was immer sich füllen lässt: Braten, Gulasch, Rouladen, Saumagen, Saucen, Hausmacherwurst, Suppen, Beilagen, saure Gurken, Spargelspitzen und Marmeladen. Es gilt die Maxime der Einigkeit: frisch und in schonender Verarbeitung, kontrolliertes Bio, das alles nach bewährten Rezepten. Das alles kann man in der ""Scheune"" kaufen und zu Hause auf die Teller bringen - und die Gefahr ist groß, das begeisterte Lob der heimischen Gäste in Sachen unerwarteter Kochkunst in die eigene Tasche zu stecken, statt es bescheiden an Franz Klöfer durchzureichen.
Ein kleiner Rundblick über die Preisgestaltung: Die Sauce Bolognese etwa, 400 ml, kostet 6 Euro. Osso Buco, 400 ml, 8 Euro. 400 ml Kalbsbäckle stehen bei 8,50 Euro, der Wildschweinbraten bei 9.50 Euro. Die Gulaschsuppe vom Angus-Rind, Bio natürlich, steht mit 6,50 Euro auf der Rechnung. Diverse Pates, etwa von der Weidegans oder vom Reh um 7 Euro pro 200 ml.
Die Scheune bietet aber viel mehr: ein kleiner, aber umwerfend sortierter Teil der Klöfer'schen Weinkarte steht dort in den Regalen, Raritäten, Kostbarkeiten, Seltenheiten, ganz sicher äußerst kundenfreundlich kalkuliert. Und schließlich bleiben die vielen kleinen Geschenkideen, Flohmarktteilchen und Antiquitäten, die Juliane Klöfer zusammenträgt und liebevoll hergerichtet weiterreicht.
Die ""Scheune"" ist von Dienstag bis Samstag zwischen 18 und 20.30 Uhr geöffnet, und sie hat noch einen erheblichen Nebenwert, der sich im Restaurant bemerkbar macht: Klöfers Stammkunden kennen die kleine Weingalerie, ein Gartenhaus, ganz am Ende des schönen Gartens gelegen. Hier betrieb Franz Klöfer über Jahre jenen Weinverkauf, den er jetzt in die ""Scheune"" ausgelagert hat. Und so ist die wunderschöne Laube nun wieder frei für Gäste, die dort einen großen Tisch für bis zu zehn Personen vorfinden, umringt von höchst bequemen, großen Sesseln. Einen schöneren Abend im Kreis von Famile oder Freunden kann man kaum verbringen - allein dafür muss man Franz und Juliane Klöfer eigentlich auf Knien danken.",4

Restaurants,"ja, das restaurant ritter...
auch wir waren schon mehrmals dort und besonders die pizzen sind sehr zu empfehlen. holzofen, dünner knuspriger teig und gut belegt. einmal pro woche ist pizzatag: dann kosten die meisten pizzen nur sechs euro, absoluter kampfpreis, der aber nicht zu lasten der qualität geht. personal ist aufmerksam, freundlich und hilfsbereit. trotz des etwas in die jahre gekommenen ambientes (oder vielleicht gerade deshalb) fühlt man sich wohl und es hat sowohl innen als auch im biergarten eine gemütliche atmosphäre.",4

Wir telefonieren lieber und können dann zuverlässig knapp 15 min später eine der besten Pizzen abholen, die hier in der Ecke erhältlich ist.",4

Die Damen und Herren waren immer sehr freundlich und haben bisher auch unsere kleinen Sonderwünsche immer erfüllt. Definitiv eine Empfehlung!",4
Restaurants,"Allgemein
Mit zwei alten Freunden verabredete ich mich in Mühlburg, da einer der beiden dort wohnt. Eigentlich wollten wir einen Kaffee zusammen trinken, da sich aber aufgrund von verschiedenen Terminen der Treffpunkt sich immer mehr in den Abend zog, fragten wir ihn, ob wir nicht irgendwo hingehen könnten, wo man auch eine Kleinigkeit essen kann. Daraufhin schlug er den ""Ritter"" vor, da es dort eine leckere Pizza aus dem Holzkohle-Stein-Ofen gibt. Mit dem Hinweis, dass das Lokal etwas in die Jahre gekommen ist, nahmen wir den Vorschlag an. Ich selbst war schon einmal dort gewesen, etwa vor 10 Jahren. Also lies ich mich überraschen. Mit dem Parken sieht es in Mühlburg meistens nicht ganz so gut aus, schon gar nicht an dieser Ecke. Aber ich hatte Glück und fand einen Parkplatz gegenüber. Einige Parkbuchten sind nämlich vorhanden.
Bedienung
Der Service war zu Beginn etwas überfordert. Viele Tische im Lokal und fast der komplette Biergarten waren besetzt. Klar, in den Sommermonaten ist es für Gastronomen immer ein bisschen schwer einzuschätzen, wie viele Servicekräfte in den Einsatz kommen müssen, da bei geöffnetem Biergarten sich die Zahl der Gäste sprunghaft nach oben verändert. Die Dame, die dann für unseren Tisch zuständig war, konnte aber durch ihr freundliches Wesen, die Verzögerungen gekonnt überspielen.
Ich hatte meine Pizza Zingara ohne Knoblauch bestellt. Sie wurde dann doch mit Knoblauch gemacht und mir an den Tisch gebracht, da die 3 Pizzen an unserem Tisch gemeinsam fertig waren. Sie entschuldigte sich bei mir und sagte, sie würde die Pizza neu machen lassen, wenn ich sie nicht wollte, aber sie wollte eben trotzdem fragen, da wir sonst nicht gemeinsam essen könnten. Normalerweise hätte ich wahrscheinlich um eine neue, wie von mir bestellte Pizza gebeten, aber es war eher lustig und eben gut verpackt, dass ich dann doch mit Knoblauch aß, was mir ebenfalls schmeckte.
Eigentlich hätte ich für den Service bzgl. der Leistung insgesamt eher nur 2 Sterne vergeben, aber eben Charme und Persönlichkeit bei einer Bedienung können sehr viele kleinere Fehler überspielen, daher hier lieb gemeinte 3 Sterne!
Empfehlenswert, wie bei sehr vielen Italienern der Espresso. Beim Bezahlen wurde uns noch ein Grappa, oder ein Espresso aufs Haus angeboten, was wir dankend ablehnten, aber die Geste sehr wohl wahrgenommen haben.
Das Essen
Vorab nahm ich einen kleinen italienischen Salat für 5,20 €. Dazu gereicht wurden einige Scheiben frisches Baguette. Der Salat, ein klassischer Italienischer für Pizzeriabesucher, mit Käse-Schinken-Streifen, Tomaten, Gurken, Blattsalten, Zwiebeln und gekochtem Ei. Hier aber mit einem schmackhaften Essig-Öl-Dressing, ganz klar mit einem Fruchtessig, lecker.
Die Pizza Zingara mit Salami, Zwiebeln, Knoblauch, scharfe Paprika für € 9,00 war ebenfalls gut. Dünner Boden, guter ausreichender Belag. Der Holzkohle-Stein-Ofen gibt der Pizza dabei ein besonders leckeres Aroma. Knuspriger schmackhafter Rand. Hier kann man nicht viel besser machen. Der Teig macht diese Pizza aus. Und dieser ist sehr gelungen. Da in Karlsruhe gute Pizzerien etwas rar gesäht sind, oftmals sind es eben gar keine Italiener die dieses Gericht zubereiten, ist der Ritter mit diesen Pizzen auf jeden Fall eine empfehlenswerte Adresse.
Hier vergebe ich 4 Sterne, eben aufgrund der guten Pizza. Da ich aber nichts über Pasta, Fleisch und Fisch sagen kann, wir aßen alle nur Salat und Pizza, möchte ich eben auch hauptsächlich die Pizza bewerten. Und diese war einfach gut!
Das Ambiente
Tatsächlich wirkt es von Außen nicht, wie ein italienisches Lokal, sondern eher, wie ein deutsches Wirtshaus. Die Inneneinrichtung ist ein Relikt aus dem letzten Jahrtausend. Der Gastraum trennt sich in zwei Bereiche, die Fenster sind mit gelber Milchglasverglasung, die man ebenfalls von früher kennt, damit niemand hinein schauen kann. Die Bestuhlung ist ebenfalls in die Jahre gekommen. Es ist trotzdem sauber und gepflegt, aber etwas Farbe, ein neuer Boden und neues Mobiliar könnte das Lokal stark aufwerten. Im hinteren Bereich gibt es wohl eine alte Kegelbahn, die im Nebenraum mit einer großen Falttür abgetrennt ist. Früher gab es solche Trennungen öfter in Gasträumen, heute verzichtet man eher darauf. Geht man im Gastraum etwas ums Eck am Holzofen findet man den großzügigen Biergarten im Hof. Zunächst vermutet man diesen großen Innenhof dort gar nicht. Die Bestuhlung besteht aus Plasitkstühlen. Besteck wird einem in einem Steinkrug gereicht. Recht einfach gehalten, ebenfalls alles ein bisschen in die Jahre gekommen. Rein optisch kann man hier einen ""roten Faden"" erkennen. :) Man befindet sich dann in einem Mühlburger Hinterhof, der irgendwie auch einen gewissen Charme versprüht.
Klar ist, Fans des Ritters besuchen das Lokal nicht wegen seiner Einrichtung, sondern eben wegen der leckeren Pizza.

Restaurants,"Schade, dass es eine typische Vereinsgaststätte ist. Die Umgebung ist so perfekt mit Sportangeboten ausgestattet, da würde etwas mehr Fingerspitzengefühl bei der Ausstattung sicherlich nicht schaden. Das Essen finde ich meist ziemlich fettig, den Salat lieblos angemacht und eher teuer. Auch der Service wird nicht mit einer Medaille ausgestattet.
Kürzlich hat ein stadtbekannter CDUler nach neuen Spielgeräten rund um die Gaststätte gerufen. Vielleicht tut sich ja was in den nächsten Monaten und eventuell bringt auch die neue Sport-Kita etwas mehr lukullisches Leben dorthin. Wäre super, dann würden wir nach jedem Fächerbad-Besuch oder dem DAV-Sonntag-Familien-Klettern gerne hier einkehren.",3
Restaurants,"SSC Sportzentrum ist eine Sportgaststätte das innen aber ganz passabel eingerichtet ist. Alte Bilder an der Wand, Blumen und schön dekorriert.
Ausser uns war am frühen Abend nur ein anderer Tisch besetzt die mit dem essen schon fertig waren.
Ein bisschen gewöhnungsbedürftig ist die Tatsache,dass bei vielen Essen darauf geachtet werden muss,dass alle Beilagen extra kosten(SCHNITZEL+POMMES+SALAT);dann ist das Preisniveau doch nicht ganz billig.
Das Essen kam recht schnell,was bei meinem Überbackenen erste Befürchtungen aufkommen lies. Die Bedienung fragte mich recht schnell,ob es schmeckt,worauf ich Ihr sagte das ich erst anfangen muss zu essen und ich Ihr gerne später Auskunft gebe.
Mein Berner Schnitzel war dann leider auch(man glaubt es kaum) INNEN NOCH ROH!!!
Ich sagte es der Bedienung,die sich sofort dafür entschuldigte und mir ein neues ESSEN anbot. Da ich aber dann nicht mehr alleine essen wollte,sagte ich Ihr das ich keines mehr will. Ich trank noch ein Bier und die Bedienung teilte mir mit,dass mein Essen storniert worden ist. Ein überbackenes Schweineschnitzel nicht durch gebraten und ohne Zeitdruck zum Gast zu bringen, sollte, glaube ich nicht passieren. Aber wie auf die Reklamation reagiert wurde ist doch sehr in Ordnung,bekommt man in den wenigsten Gaststätten.",3

Restaurants,"Allgemein
Eine tolle Küche, ein nettes Service, aber ein Rahmen, der weder zu dem einen, noch zu dem anderen passt. Dieses ""gut-bürgerliche Eckkneipe""-Ambiente zieht ganz bestimmt keine Leute so um die 30 an. Ausser sie kommen, weil ""Opa einlädt"" oder weil sie dort in der Nähe wohnen und sich mal verirrt haben. Schade eigentlich. Wenn ich der Koch wäre, würde ich mir ein schöneres Lokal suchen, dann würde auch das Preis/Leistungsverhältnis gleich viel besser aussehen.
Bedienung
Es gibt einen Kellner, einen super-netten, flinken und gut ausgebildeten Mitarbeiter. Ich finde er ist aber überlastet; eine zumindest zeitweise Unterstützung wäre sehr hilfreich. Er selbst hätte mindestens 4 Sterne verdient, aber die Tatsache, daß er alleine ist, lässt leider nicht mehr zu.
Das Essen
Pfifferlingrahmsuppe, Salat mit Putenstreifen, Rehlendchen, Zwiebelrostbraten, Rindersteak, Rhabarberparfait, Crème Brulée.Alles sehr lecker, Portionen nicht allzu groß, aber ausreichend, schön präsentiert, köstlich abgeschmeckte Salate und schmackhafte Beilagen. Fein auch, der Gruß aus der Küche, ein knuspriges Mini-Pfannküchlein mit Zucchini und einem Knobi-Dipp, hübsch anzusehen, super-lecker und richtig serviert, wie ein kleines Vorspeischen! (Hilft die strammen Preise besser zu verdauen.)
Das Ambiente
Trotz dem idealem Kellner, der alles für seine Gäste tut, und trotz der köstlichen und gut präsentierten Speisen und Getränke, hat dieses Lokal immer noch viel von der ""gut-bürgerlichen"" Schnitzel und Cevapcici-Eckkneipe, die es jahrzehntelang war. Ich glaube das Mobiliar und die Dekoration sind seit 40 Jahren nicht mehr geändert worden! Da nützt das neue feine Geschirr, der kleine, rote Teppich am Eingang und die Terrassentische auf dem Bürgersteig der Gartentrasse auch nicht viel. Ich hoffe, dass der Pächter nicht allzu viel Pacht zahlen muss, bzw. die Besitzer mal in die Tasche greifen und eine Rundumrenovierung anstreben!

Restaurants,"Peinlich peinlich... bin nun schon fast 20 Jahre in KA und Jäck ist erst vor kurzem auf meinem Schirm aufgetaucht (warum haben die auch keine Internetpräsenz?).

EDIT: das mit der Webpräsenz wurde inzwischen nachgeholt, zudem auch auf Facebook zu finden

Wir sind eher zufällig in den Osterbrunch ""hereingestolpert"", eigentlich wollten wir nur kurz vor dem Shopping einen Happen frühstücken und stellten dann fest, dass das ""Jäck"" an diesem Tag sein Sortiment u.a. in einem deutlich aufgebohrten Brunch präsentiert. Schon das Schaufenster verheißt leckere Dinge und nachdem wir drinnen das Buffet gesehen hatten war uns klar: ""das müssen wir machen""... vor allem für lächerliche 15 EUR.

Selten einen Brunch mit so viel Auswahl gehabt - zwar (bis auf Rührei/Speck/Würstchen & eine Suppe) keine Warmgerichte aber dafür jede Menge Leckeres aus eigener Produktion & Küche... super-geschmackvoll präsentiert und definitiv kein 08/15-Brunch mit Aufbackbrötchen & Packwurst vom Discounter. Das einzige was wir vermissten war vernünftiges Brot und auch das Laugengebäck war sehr schnell alle... das kostet vom Gesamteindruck her aber höchstens den 6. oder 7. Stern.

Ebenfalls sehr zu empfehlen, wer etwas leichteres sucht!

Andere wiederum sind eher mit WLAN ausgestattet und bieten im Home Office arbeitenden eine nette Abwechslung.

Das Cafe Jäck ist eine für sich. Der Kuchen in der Vitrine sieht verboten gut aus, gleiches gilt für die Pralinen und Kleingebäcke. Das Interieur quietscht dagegen zwischen allen Stilen. Gemütlichkeit will nicht so recht aufkommen, aber dafür fühlen sich hier unterschiedlichste Menschen willkommen und schaffen gemeinsam eine Atmosphäre des aus der Zeit gefallenen Oase für diese Momente, für die noch kein Ort geschaffen.

Mein ortskundiger Begleiter tat gut daran, mich hierher zu führen und sorgte für seine Bestellung ""eine heisse Schokolade 66"" für mein Erstaunen - ja, hier kann man seinen Kakao in Prozent bestellen von milchschokoladig bis dunkelzart. Für Leute wie mich, die der Milch und dem Gluten fernbleiben dürfen fand sich auf Nachfrage in der Vitrine ein Florentiner. Der war eher unspektakulär und ich beneidete die Begleiter um ihren saftigen Himbeerkuchen.

One such popular close is Lady Stairs Close. Connecting the Royal Mile and the Mound, this close is named after Lady Stairs house, situated within the close, now housing by the Writer's Museum (look out for a future review). Lady Stairs has her own interesting tale of murder and marriage which if your interested I recommend you look up before your visit or wait to inevitably hear on your tour.

Many Old Town tours will take you to this Close, and if you're not planning on venturing with one, its really worth a quick peek. It shows a great example of 17th century town houses. It's also great if you like creepy old stone alleyways with a Gothic twist.

Happy Valley Road to The Boulders will give you a great view of desert scenery and the mountains of the area (McDowell Mountains, Pinnacle Peak and Lone Mountain). But in order to appreciate Sonoran Desert beauty at a deeper level, you have to go to the visitor parking and exhibit area on the east side of Scottsdale Road about 1/4 mile south of Jomax Road. Signs and displays in this area will acquaint you with the common flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert, and you can use this as a starting point for a desert walk along the Scenic Drive's mostly paved sidewalk/trail along N. Scottsdale Rd., with many signs identifying the desert plants along the way. Don't forget to bring plenty of water and wear a hat and sunscreen, though, if you do plan to take the hike. You can cap your trip to the area by dining and shopping at El Pedregal at the Boulders, at the northern end of the Scenic Drive.",5

Das Ratsstübchen war nett aufgemacht, ein bisschen wie auf einer ""Hütten"" in den Bergen. Holzwände, rot-weiße Vorhänge, ... Auf der Karte standen zum Beispiel Germknödel und Suppen (Gulasch, Kürbiscreme, Thai). Wir entschieden uns für die drei erwähnten Suppen, die zwei Mal mit zwei Scheiben Brot und einmal mit einer Scheibe Brot serviert wurden. Geschmacklich war ich enttäuscht. Mit Sicherheit teilweise weil ich von diesem Lokal mehr erwartet hatte. Es war aber nur durchschnittliche Weihnachtsmarktqualität. Störend war auch, dass die Stand-Chefin mehrfach die Kleine anpfiff, die sich mit ihr um die Essensausgabe kümmerte.

Restaurants,"Allgemein
 Mal wieder Ratsstube auf Wunsch der Kinder, da die sehr gerne hier essen und vor allem danach auf dem Marktplatz abzischen können.
Bedienung
Service ist sehr stark von der Zusammesetzung des Servicepersonal abhängig. Bei diesem Besuch war der Service herrvorragend, haben wir aber auch schon bei einer anderen Servicebesetzung auch schon ganz anders erlebt. Z.B du bekommst deinen Wein, den du passend zum Hauptgang bestellt hast, am Ende des Hauptgangs dann braucht man in nicht mehr und ähnliches mehr. Von daher nur drei Sterne.
Das Essen
Das Essen ist unverändert sehr gut. Besonders das Wiener Schnitzel, das ich doch meistens bestelle weil es wirklich richtig gut ist und auch wirklich Kalbfleisch ist (das ist nicht bei allen so, auch wenn es drauf steht). Meine Frau hatte den Ratsstubenteller, das Fleisch perfekt, auch sehr lecker. Unsere Kinder hatten die Riesengarnelen, auch sehr lecker, für mich etwas zu viel Knobloch in der Aioli, aber das ist Geschmacksache.
In der Ratsstuben gibt es einen sehr guten Riesling (Neuweier Mauerberg). Komplement.
Das Ambiente
Ambiente ist natürlich zweigeteilt: Im Sommer kann man wunderbar draußen sitzen: Blick auf den Marktplatz auf das alte Rathaus, teilweise auf das Schloss das ist ist schon richtig schön. Im Winter allerdings ist es schwierig, das Ambiente im Restaurant hat den Charme von Eiche-Rustikal bisschen bessere Sportgaststätte. Also innendrin könnte man schon einiges machen.

Die Speisekarte mit Tages-Empfehlungen gefällt uns sehr gut. Der Ratsherren-Teller und auch der gemischte Salat sind frisch, knackig und lecker. Der hierfür aufgerufene Preis liegt an einer Obergrenze- wir empfinden das dennoch als fair, wenngleich der nicht aufmerksame und ""lasche"" Service dazu hinkt!

Ich entschied mich für einen Salat ""Der Amerikaner"". Nach kurzer Wartezeit standen die sehr großzügig portionierten Essen nun auch vor uns und machten optisch einen sehr leckeren Eindruck. Nach der optischen Begeisterung folgte nun auch die geschmackliche Zufriedenheiten. Das Geflügel vom Grill auf dem Salat war sehr lecker, der Salat ansich sehr knackig und daß Dressing sehr erfrischend. Alle 5 in der Runde waren mit ihrem Essen sehr zufrieden und restlos gesättigt und das zu einem wirklich sehr gutem Preis.

Dennoch war der umfangreiche Grillteller vom Holzofen äusserst schmackhaft und fettarm. Die Saucen waren ebenso sehr intensiv. Das Fladenbrot hätte ich mir warm und etwas frischer gewünscht.

Werde das Restaurant auf jeden Fall erneut aufsuchen, da auf der (leider durch die Schutzfolien schwer lesbaren) Speisekarte noch einige interessante Gerichte standen, die ich mir nicht entgehen lassen wollte.",4
Local Flavor,"I am quite surprised that Newington has not been already reviewed. It is one of the most popular areas with students and is a buzzing community!

Many students come to love this area, either through staying or constantly walking through it. It has many good bars, including one of my favourites, the Southsider. Additionally it has two of the most important stores known to students. It has the Tesco metro which is always busy and is indeed one of the busiest in the entire country! Secondly, the twenty four hour Scotmid store is located right across from the Tesco. This store is a lifeline for people after stumbling out of clubs in the early hours of the morning!

The area is squeezed between the Meadows, the Royal Mile, Holyrood, Sciennes and Prestonfield. It might be not as well known as these other areas, but it certainly is an up and coming area. However, this place will be better known for it being student central (less posh than its student cousins in Morningside or Marchmont, think of it has the indie alternative!)",4
Local Flavor,"Uusally when people think of student-ville, they think of Marchmont or New Town, but Newington definitely falls into that category too. Mainly, because it's right next to the university, so even the students who don't live here still fill the cafés and pubs.

The nice thing about Newington is that it has a 'village community' feel to it, with the local butchers and fishmongers on Clerk Street, and all the little one-off independent shops like Paper Gallery. It also has it's fair share of quirky cafés, like Kilamanjaro or In Delhi, my personal favourite, which does amazing roti wraps and mango cheesecake.

The one downside is that there's a slight shabby element to the area, courtesy of The Grapes pub and the half dozen or so boozehounds that are stumbling around in its doorway smoking cheap cigarettes at any given time of the day.",4
Local Flavor,"I've always been the odd one out in that I've never been that much a fan of Newington. People who live in Edinburgh are very much split along many lines. The most concrete ones being: Old Town, New Town, Leith. But Old Town is also split between Morningside, Bruntsfield, Marchmont, Newington, Grassmarket. It's not that we're competing. I mean, as far as Morningside, Bruntsfield and Marchmont go, we're generally on the same side: Newington's too noisy and busy for us. People who live in Newington find that Marchmont et al are far too quiet and boring. 

I'm a light sleeper, and I'm also a bit of a misanthrope. Particularly when it comes to students who are, I know, my people, technically. But I carry the student title with a bit of humility and a touch of embarrassment. Newington may be full of cafes and bars, but hey, they're just a ten minute walk from Marchmont anyway. And we have our wee cafes too, I guess.",3
Local Flavor,"A bit grittier than the more genteel student-plagued areas in the city, Newington has it's fair share of rough characters, especially outside The Grapes pub, but it also has countless fantastic ethnic eateries, cool shops and a proper ""real city"" feel that some of Edinburgh's more glamourous locales do not.

I'm not really sure if Nicholson Street counts as Newington, if it does then it's a 5.",4
Local Flavor,"I like Newington a lot.

Not coming from Edinburgh but having a bit of a connection with the place (half the people I know used to stay there, including my aunt who lived in Morningside for years), it makes me a strange judge when it comes to areas. I felt well acquainted with Morningside since it's my aunt's first love, and she's been telling me about it since I was three and read Maisie books. I have friends who stay in Leith, Corstorphine and my ex's sister used to stay in the Grassmarket. So it's safe to say I've seen a lot of Edinburgh through my many, many visits over the years (it really is a second home these days).

It was actually only a few weeks ago that I discovered the whole of Newington. I recall having a coffee here after I did the Moonwalk a couple of years ago (the caffeine was definitely earned), and I've drifted in and out of bars at intervals over the years. But taking the time to walk around and get to know the area, I see how many merits it has. It seems generally clean, well kept and with some wee gems of businesses, even in its roughest parts. The houses around here as you head further away from the throngs of Nicholson Street seem lovely, and it looks like a fairly peaceful place to stay. There are some upmarket boutiques, a really cute wee chocolatier called Choccolate, some friendly local grocers and some great, airy coffee shops. My top picks are Trouve, the Himalayan Coffee Shop, In Dehli, Casablanca, Vogue Video and (further up the road) Armstrong's.

Generally, my experiences in Newington have been relaxed, and all shop owners were exceptionally friendly. If I ever move to Edinburgh I would try to get a flat here - even if it was higher up the price scale it would be worth it. As Gavin said, it's more authentic than a lot of the showy, tourist orientated districts in Edinbugh, and strikes a perfect balance of upmarket and down to earth.",4
Local Flavor,"Newington is a cool place to live, loads of mates who I was in first year ended up living here. The place is so full of contrasts, Nicolson Street especially, there are not many areas where you find such a big range of people. You obviously get plenty of students seeing as it is so close to the university and Pollock Halls. You also get a fair amount of homeless here as well, and there seems to be a different vagrant begging outside the Tesco Metro every day. Talking of that Tesco Metro, my friend who worked there told me that this Tesco is the second most stolen from in the country! Moreover you also get the tourists streaming in from the Royal Mile looking for a place to dine.
In general however it is a pretty nice place to live, there are plenty of cool pubs to have as you local and the whole area feels a lot less ""studenty"" than Marchmont, giving a more authentic feel of Edinburgh to students.",4
Local Flavor,"Lothian Road is more than just a street, it's kind of a neighbourhood in itself, and I'm surprised that no-one else has reviewed it yet.

It's one of the main thoroughfares of the West End, and it's littered with independent retailers, charity shops and well-known chain stores alike. But there are definitely two very different sides to Lothian Road: the daytime version and the night time version.

By day, there are more cafés, pubs and independent cinemas than you can shake a stick it, as well as beauty salons, and it's a really nice road to wander along whilst browsing in windows. And with great bus links to and from Bruntsfield, Morningside as well as the city centre, it's also easy to reach.

But then you come to Lothian Road at night, and that's a totally different story. When the shops and cafés close, the lap-dancing bars and private ""saunas"" open their doors. As a result, the kind of people that frequent Lothian Road at night goes downhill rapidly, to the extent that I wouldn't walk along there on my own at night.",3
Local Flavor,"Lothian Road is one the the major street in Edinburgh and if you're visiting, one you will almost inevtiably end up walking along. This road runs from the east end of Princes Street South East to Tollcross. At its top lies the famous Sheraton Grand hotel, at the bottom is the every scruffy but charming Tollcross with the still impressive Methodist Church Hall.

Lothian Road really is a concentration of cultural venues. It houses not only the Usher Hall, Lyceum Theatre the Traverse Theatre but also the Cameo and Filmhouse independent cinemas. If this was all Lothian road contained it would be a truly remarkable street. Unfortunetly it has a seedier side. And next to these cultural hotspots are several strip joints, sauna rooms, and seedy bars. This really only becomes a problem in the evening at night, but even during the day Lothian Road seems to attract an intimidating crowd. Having said this, from what I hear it has improved in recent years. Lothian Road also suffers from heavy traffic and often road works. It can be a bit off putting. 

It's hard to know whether to rate Lothian Road 2 or 3 starts. It's high end cultural venues steer me toward a good review, but I can't ignore the slimey drunk men out having a good evening of female degradation, that I always see hanging around. Perhaps the trend will continue and Lothian Road will improve even more. Let's hope so because it has even more potential.",2
Local Flavor,"When one gets to know Edinburgh, one also gets to know Lothian Road. It is one of the main streets in the city and is always buzzing with activity. 

Lothian Road is home to a number of my favourite independent cinemas including the Cameo and the Filmhouse. Great places to go to see films which aren't in the mainstream. On top of this, Lothian Road is also home to a number of great night club and gig venues including the HMV Picturehouse and Usher Hall. However, if you're not into your culture you can also shop in the many independent and charity shops. 

However, as has already been mentioned in past reviews, at night the 'saunas' and lap dancing clubs do open and yes, Lothian Road reveals it's seedier side. Another downside of Lothian Road is that it is one of the busiest roads in Edinburgh. 

However, apart from these two points, Lothian Road always has a great vibe, and offers a wide range of things to do!",4
Local Flavor,"I would normally rather not walk home on Lothian Road at night, not for my own safety, but because I'm not fan of dodging people trying to bottle each other. Lothian Road's also full of chains and strip bars. I mean, nothing against a strip bar, but if I had the choice, I'd rather walk through a park than walk by a strip bar where drunk men have been enjoying themselves more than necessary. 

I mean, you're not going to be able to ever avoid Lothian Road and it's not the worst place on earth, but there are definitely better parts of Edinburgh. It'll lead you straight down to the West-End, and is one of the routes you might take to the Farmer's Market on a Saturday. It's also the home of the Odeon and the Filmhouse.",2
Local Flavor,"Lothian Road appears to be on the up. 

What was once a long street that was mainly populated by commuter traffic, £1 shops, ""saunas"" with one or two nice businesses scattered inbetween, is being slowly transformed.

This street connects Bruntsfield to the West End of Princes Street. Beauteous Bruntsfield, and the buzzing West End. At the Bruntsfield end there's Home Street dotted with fantastic independents: Lupe Pintos mexican deli, The Aparment (smaller sister to my beloved The Outsider), the Cameo cinema, Pinetree Bakery. And down at the West End you have some heavy weights like the Ghillie Dhu, the Rutland, and a direct access to Princes Street department stores.

Tollcross itself, the literal intersection between Home Street and the Meadows, is still quite pretty if you ignore the constant traffic coming from 5 different directions. The lonesome clock standing in the very centre - something about it reminds me of Victorian Edinburgh. But, as I said, the traffic does come from at least 5 different directions. It's a nightmare to cross as a pedestrian, a nightmare to drive as a driver, and scary as a cyclist.

There's currently a few businesses I favour on Lothian Road. El Quixote, Passorn, Mezbaan and Real Foods are all on Brougham Place, the Meadows intersection at Tollcross right before Lothian Road begins. And then on Home Street there's all the aforementioned alongside No 1 Sushi Bar. Onto Lothian Road itself, there's Illegal Jack's, Lebowskis literally just off the corner on Morrison Street. The Filmhouse, opposite a reliable Nandos, and the Usher Hall. And well, for a while that was about it.

But wait! Then Red Squirrel opened, a sister bar of Holyrood 9a (some of the best gastropub burgers in Edinburgh). And then The Blackbird opened at the other end, on Home Street (the sister bar of Treacle, one of my other favourite gastopubs in Edina). And now news of The Hanged Bat, a beer specialist bar, is opening this month. There are more and more reasons to visit Lothian Road, and it's no longer an issue of going to one nice place and running out of other places to go.

I'm curious to see how the street continues to develop. I don't know if the saunas will disappear anytime soon, and there'll always be 20 different sandwich shops and a lot of traffic. But it's slowly becoming a nicer street in town to make a night out of.",3
Local Flavor,"Lothian Road has it all:

- Superdrug (Good for toiletries, chocolate and make up)
- Ali's Cave (Good for wool, stationery, and everything you never knew you even needed)
- Poundstretcher (V.similar to Ali's Cave, but in my opinion not quite as good)
- Hanging Bat (Good for beer and delicious hotdogs)
- Strippers (Good to see naked ladies)
- Sauna (Good for...)
- Yummy Tori (Good for Japanese food)
- Odeon (OK for films)
- Red Squirrel (Great for burgers)
- Festival Square (Great for watching TV on a HUGE screen)
- Money Shop (Good for currency)
- Freshcut (Great for soup, paninis, sandwiches etc.)
- Paper Tiger (Great for gifts and cards)
- AND much, much more!!

What more do you need on a road?",4
Local Flavor,"What can I say about this road that already hasn't been said. I suppose it's a smorgasbord of everything in the city. It's got pubs, coffee shops, thrift shops, butchers, cheese and fish mongers, even seedy strip clubs, and just about anything else you can think of. Also connected to it are the side roads at lead throughout the city to places . If you got time take a walk on this road and you will find some hidden gems.",3
Local Flavor,"When I grow up, I want to live in the West End. It's more upmarket than Newington, less studenty than New Town or Marchmont, and much more central than Brunstfield or Stockbridge.  For that reason, it tends to attract the young proffessional types and so has a really nice feel to it.

And quite apart from the practicalities, its full of gorgeous Georgian architecture and little green parks dotted about all over the place. As well as being full of great bars like the Ghillie Dhu or The Rutland, there are also lovely restaurants like La Piazza and A Room in the West End.",5
Local Flavor,"I'm not entirely sure if ""The West End"" constitutes a neighbourhood in itself. I'd never really heard the area described as this until I noticed the posters stuck to railings as in the featured picture. I think it means the area from the Fraser's end of Princes street down to Haymarket Station or thereabouts.

Anyway, like most of the city it's quite nice, but unless you count Lothian Road, which I'm not sure could be classed as ""West End"", there's not really much happening this end of town in my opinion. A few coffees shops, restaurants, and some nice hotels, but it's mainly office orientated. As such, the closer you get to Haymarket, the deader everything feels the further it gets past 5pm.",4
Local Flavor,"As far as being in New Town goes, I actually quite like the West End. Not as much as Stockbridge (I like being around water), but WAY more than the East End of Princes Street. The only problem I'd really have with ever living around that area is its extreme proximity to Princes Street, which is my idea of hell. It is decidedly the quieter side of that area, though, and is close to lots of cute cafes and shops.

Fiona was right in saying that it attracts many young professionals, mainly because it is more upmarket than Newington, and way outside most students price-range. But that gives the place a great feel, to be honest. A lot more sedate. And it smells less like puke than this side of town.",3
Public Services & Government,"It was fairly easy to get our license here- we did this the night before, after a pre-wedding party that we hosted at our home. It was late (convenient closing time is midnight) but there were a few others doing the same thing. The line wasn't too long- maybe seven other couples. We were probably in and out in roughly 40 minutes. Parking was very easy. I don't remember if if it was free. There are several people handing flyers outside for those who haven't yet planned the wedding details.",5
Public Services & Government,"Of course we came here to obtain our marriage license and it was really easy.  We came here on Veteran's Day around 11 pm since thankfully they are open till midnight and we didn't wait at all.  As soon as we walked in we went straight to the counter, paid the fee, and got our license.  The lady that helped us was friendly.  Parking was easy and free.  There was a security guard walking around outside the building, so I felt safe.",5
Public Services & Government,"The number one tip to remember before visiting this office to obtain a marriage license: COMPLETE THE ONLINE APPLICATION & BRING YOUR CONFIRMATION NUMBER.  This will virtually eliminate a wait in line; getting you in and out quickly. 

The clerk we dealt with was very efficient & knowledgeable.  We arrived on a Friday morning at 10:00 a.m. and were out of there within 30 minutes!  Beware of the street vendors selling wedding packages and other related services.  There are many that claim to ""help"" you apply for your license and will charge a fee.  This is something you can easily do yourself...online and for free.  The cost to apply for a marriage license is $60.  Be sure to bring cash in order to avoid a service fee for debit/credit cards.",5
Public Services & Government,"It's easier to fill out a form for a marriage license here than to find parking on this block. 

Of course Sunday-late afternoon is the optimal time to go. It means free parking on street, provided there is an open slot, and zero people in line. Everyone's situation varies but in my own, it was smoother than filling out a form for DMV. Smoother than varnished wood.

In the end, we got all our papers within 10 minutes including a nifty envelope to hold them in. And the lady said ""congratulations"" 

I just wonder why we fill out our papers with pencil. Haha.",5
Public Services & Government,"Government efficiency at its finest.

We had actually submitted a pre-application so we could use the express queue. Yes, there is an express queue, how awesome is that? It was surprisingly quiet (I've heard the queue can be out the door around the corner, so do the pre-application). 

We walked right up to a free window, gave our reference number, ID, paid for the license and BAM, we were licensed to wed! They even give you, get this, a souvenir license. It's not legal proof but a nice way to help you remember when you sober up that indeed you did get married :)",4
Public Services & Government,"To start with...you know how on the website it says it's only a few blocks away from Fremont Street?  Yeah...if by ""few blocks"" you mean ""OMGZ WILL THESE BLOCKS NEVER END?!?!"".

But once there, they are grumpy, but quick and efficient.  My BFF and her fiancee (now hubs) was in and out within 15 minutes.  Our walk from Fremont to here took longer.",4
Public Services & Government,"I filled out our application online about a month ahead of time and wrote down the reference number. Like previous yelpers mentioned, I recommend that method to everyone.

There were 2 lines when we entered, 1 for online applicants and 1 for walk ins. The walk in line was about 3 or 4 deep on a tuesday morning, while our line was wide open. After waiting a minute for the next available receptionist, we were on our way to getting our marriage license. The woman explained everything in detail what we needed to give the wedding chapel and how to order a copy of the certificate online afterwards. She was very nice and helpful. The whole process took less than 10 minutes. Quick and painless.

We took the SDX bus from Mandalay Bay to Bonneville Transit Station stop and walked around the next block to get to the bureau.",5
Public Services & Government,"I accompanied some fine folks to their final destination (just kidding).
We walked in and as they were filling out the application I stood near the door watching couples walk in, register, and walk out smiling. After 10 minutes of waiting I seriously started to get nauseated at the thought of marriage. Me and my non-commitment phobia (haha) then I started to feel the blood get a little thinner and light-headedness started. I started to breath heavier then finally the fine young couple finished their business as I was relieved to leave.

Last time I was a maid of honor at a girlfriend's wedding. This time I was a witness at a wedding. What's next? Stay tuned.",3
Public Services & Government,"Quick and efficient.  When we went for our license, a news reporter asked us to appear on camera, but we were not getting married that day, so they moved on to the next couple.  Husband didn't know the name of his biological mother, which is the name still on his birth certificate.  After several calls to relatives, we just told the clerk we didn't know the name and asked if it was OK to leave it blank.  She said that people leave the father's name blank, so there was not a problem.  
What a great help!",4
Public Services & Government,super easy and quick to get a marriage certificate if you fill out everything online first.  The people who showed up and did it there seemed to be waiting in line for a long time.  When we (my now husband and I) arrived we got to cut everyone because we'd done the online paperwork.,4
Public Services & Government,Quick & easy! $60 dollars out the door!,5
Public Services & Government,Went online to fill out the form before we arrived. Once we got to Vegas we rented a car and went straight there. We were in and out in 20 min. Awesome work Clark County!,5
Public Services & Government,"I had heard stories about hour long waits, but that was not the case for us on a rainy Saturday morning. The regular line looked to be fairly short, but since we filled out the info online, our line was non-existent! There was a couple at the window, then it was our turn. Bring cash to avoid the debit card fee.

There are hustlers outside, trying to lure you to their chapels. If you are on a whim and don't have one picked out yet, I guess you could score a deal! Otherwise, just let them know you have a place already and they back down. 

As for parking, there is paid parking on the street. We dropped in two quarters just to be on the safe side... They watch and the fine is $20, so don't cheap out on that quarter! Lol. :-)",5
Public Services & Government,"Went on the busiest day of the year New years eve.  It was packed around 11:30am. There were all type of characters. It didn't make a difference if you got it on line.  The other line was moving faster than the on line- line. 

Professional and fast.  $60 bucks. We were there exactly one hour.",5
Public Services & Government,"We went on a Wednesday night around 8:30pm.  No line, actually only 2 other couples there.  We filled out the application there ( each person fills one out) and took it to the counter.  Less than 10 minutes later we were walking out with our license and instructional paperwork.  It was so easy and the woman who helped us was actually friendly and funny.",5
Public Services & Government,"if all government agencies were as quick, efficient, and helpful, oh what a wonderful world it would be...

fill out the marriage application online and save yourself a ton of time. show up, verify your info, sign, pay your $60 (or $65 with credit card - ""processing fees"" - of course we paid cash), and you're out. I think we were in there for about 10 minutes. contrast this to the horror of waiting on line at a DMV here in New York, such as the Red Hook one or Coney Island!

they're open 8 AM to midnight, 7 days a week, 365 days a year!

note that the block outside is filled with people trying to get you to go to their chapel/officiating location, but they weren't aggressive. perhaps the 120-degree weather had something to do with that. we already had a location (a block away) which was convenient.

the surrounding area is a bit barren and bleak to look at, so bring the phone numbers for a car service to get in/out.",5
Public Services & Government,I thought it was really cool that they are open 24 hours here.  It was about 11:20 p.m. when my brother and (now) sister-in-law stopped in to get their license.  They had three windows open and the process took about 10 minutes.  The clerks were very friendly.,4
Public Services & Government,"We had a last minute emergency where we had to get a copy of our wedding certificate. I obtained the email address of the Marriage Bureau and sent my email asking for an urgent reply. Bart called us right away that morning, and was able to overnight it to us. He was really terrific in understanding our need and helped us in the most professional manner. We were very impressed and very thankful for his help. Thank you again, Bart!",5
Public Services & Government,The staff was friendly but we did end up waiting longer than many other people had stated in their reviews. The wait was at least 30 mins and it was warm\humid inside. Overall not a bad experience and happy to be getting married:),4
Public Services & Government,"Easy peasy! Filled out the forms on the website and then went down to pay, sign and pick up the paperwork. Because we did the online thing, we were in a much shorter line and got in and out in a jiff. The people there are really friendly and funny. They see it all. We met some great folks while standing in line. Definitely a memorable experience.",5
Public Services & Government,"We went a few days before our wedding to pick up our license, which we completed a pre-application for online. There was no line, so we went right up to a window. While the clerk reviewed our paperwork, we pitied the couples in the back of the office filling out paperwork together. After a few minutes, we paid our $77 (I guess the price went up? We paid in cash.) and left with license in hand. Easy!

Edit: Knocking a couple stars off due to an issue in receiving our certificates. I ordered two on October 2nd. My husband called two weeks later (allow for the 7-10 business days) and was told that it took 7-10 days to process, THEN they would mail it. A week later, still nothing in the mail. He called again and a helpful person told us she would put another copy in the mail the next day, which arrived two business days later. In short, if you don't have your certificate within a few days of ordering it, yours got lost.",3
Public Services & Government,"We have our license, I guess that means its REALLY happening!!

Saturday morning, we drove down to get our marriage license.  We were in and out in about 20 minutes.  

The process was easy, and pleasant, and the lady who helped us was extremely friendly, and efficient!  

You can fill out the forms there on site, or online, but the line for the people who completed the online forms was much longer.  

If you're going, make sure to have your proper ID, along with mother and father's full names and birth place info.  If you've been divorced, its helpful to know when it was finalized.  

Highly recommended!!!",5
Public Services & Government,Some un-brilliant person in charge thought it made sense to merge the marriage linens with business services. So to get a DBA/FFN or passport you stand in the marriage line. One more prime example of government  stupidity.,1
Public Services & Government,Super fast and efficient. Old guy security guard and black 30/40something guy at counter were super friendly. Maybe they could decorate the waiting area with some fun Vegas wedding pics?,5
Public Services & Government,"I read the reviews what people said about this place and I disagree , from the time we came in in the building, my friends who were getting the license and my self we sow happy faces and everyone was very happy to see us there. The forms were very easy to fill up , took my friends about 5 minutes to have the application done. When we all approach the window the lady smiled at us and said happy new year with a love on her face. The process was about another 5 min and we were done. At the end a big surprise was waiting for my boys -:). The manager came to us and with a big smile said that my guys are the 5000th same sex married couple , we all start to Louth and could't believe that was happening with them. What a blessing to see your friends getting married and having such a big surprise . Next day my guys were on all the media ( Chanel 5fox, cw, ce, nbc,) We experienced best wedding ever and met very nice people starting from the Clark County marriage to White Chapel wedding. Thank you Las Vegas. Recommend this place to everyone",5
Public Services & Government,fast ( if you fill up the pre application on line it saves you a loooot of time!) and easy! Great place to get things done! In less than 10 minutes we were out and buying the champagne foe the wedding hahaha,5
Public Services & Government,"A Dutch man and a Filipina walk into the marriage bureau in Vegas and they see an Irish bride and groom fully dressed in their wedding regalia ... sounds like the beginning of a joke but it was actually what happened on our visit to Clark County Marriage Bureau. After filling up our pre-application for a marriage license online, we showed up and apart from a pretty short line, we saw that mysterious couple. ""I wonder what their story is,"" we mused. We didn't wait very long for our turn and once we got the window, everything was easy peasy: we just had to look at a print out to verify that the information was correct, hand over the $77 fee for the license (tip #1: bring cash as there is an additional processing fee if you use a credit card), et voilá we had our marriage license! And then ... Oops. We realized that the addresses we had entered online actually appeared as the city that we're from on the certificate. No biggie for me but for my hubby to be with two addresses, it was maybe problematic. We walked out because we didn't feel like lining up again but were sufficiently bothered that the next day, we had to go right back and fix it. They didn't give us much of a problem; the lady at the counter said we could basically write whatever we wanted under place of residence (I was tempted to say Neverland). But we wanted to be sure there were no hitches in our future so we sorted that out.

IF however any of your names are misspelled, that can be quite problematic. We guessed that the couple in full bridal attire probably realized they had a typo right before the wedding and had to go change the license (our research told us that there's no additional fee if you make a change before getting married but there might be one afterwards ... so tip #2: check and double check everything!).

Other tips that might be helpful:

Tip #3: Out-of-towners should know that your marriage certificate won't be immediately available. The ""certificate"" your chapel gives you is just a souvenir. The minister who conducted your marriage has 10 business days to file. I stalked the Clark County Marriage Bureau website and searched their database everyday to see if our marriage had already been filed. Thankfully our minister at Graceland Chapel filed ours in 3 business days so my stalker behavior was short-lived. Once the marriage is filed, then you can order the certified copy of your marriage certificate. In all likelihood, you'll already be back home by then so they will have to mail it to you. Again, they have 7-10 business days to put your certificate in the mail. Ours thankfully arrived 6 days after I ordered it. If you're on a strict timeline, however, you may want to factor all the worse case scenarios before fully committing to a Vegas wedding.

Tip #4: Despite what Britney's life story suggests, you can't really get married if you're drunk. The marriage bureau will not give you a certificate if you appear drugged or drunk, and supposedly the chapels won't let you go through with it either (we did not attempt to test this). So yeah, I suppose Britney somehow got away with it ... but you're not Britney so don't drink-and-bride.",5
Public Services & Government,"Easy process. Very quick. The woman who did our paperwork loved her job--she was personable and genuinely happy for us. It's a quick 5 minute walk from the Fremont Street Experience parking garage. The only annoying thing to watch out for is that outside the building are solicitors--asking you about where your ceremony is, who is your officiant, yada-yada. I would just advise you to walk quick...without saying anything.",5
Public Services & Government,"My soon to be wife did all the paperwork online so the process was even faster when we arrived to sign the paperwork required to get our marriage certificate. Excellent customer service, and the process was fast. Plan ahead, they have all the necessary paperwork online. Whole process took less then 10 minutes.",5
Public Services & Government,"Extremely easy! 
You come and pay and fill out paperwork. It has to be returned in a specific time frame (I don't remember as mine was going to be done way before hand). You can either have them mail the marriage certificate to you and that takes time. Or you can come and pick up at kiosk for about $35!
Simple and relatively quick. Between both visits, I was here less than 30 minutes.",3
Public Services & Government,"Vegas just makes it SO easy to get married in this city! The marriage bureau is open 7 days a week (even on holidays) until midnight!

Prior to arriving in Vegas, you can fill out a pre-application with all of your information online and you're given a confirmation number once it's complete. When you get to the marriage bureau, you just have to show your forms of identification, sign some paperwork, and you're out within 10 minutes! Bring $77 in cash (LOL at the number) or you can pay with credit with a small service charge. Easy peasy! Another plus is that the employees who work here are the nicest, friendliest people that I've ever encountered at a courthouse.

After you get married, the wedding salon sends the official marriage certificate back to you. I received a phone call 2 days after we got married and they gave us the option of paying for our certificate over the phone and receiving it within 2-3 business days vs. logging in online and waiting 6 weeks for it. The clerk that I spoke to was informative and friendly throughout the whole phone call! I picked the obvious choice and she went ahead and sent me relevant information for name changing, social security, and etc.

Overall, I had an awesome experience here and I wish the same for every bride getting married in Vegas!",5
Public Services & Government,"FAST. helpful and quick, it doesn't take long to make it happen. They're friendly, too - not something I expected, to be honest. 
Hopefully, will never go back. ;)",5

Local Flavor,"Buccleuch Place, located just behind George Square, is a street which hosts the hustle and bustle of the student community of Edinburgh University. As the university owns many of the buildings, Buccleuch Place has become a favourite location for tutorials and classes when rooms cannot be found in the usual, more popular areas. 

And when you go to these tutorials, you will find, like I did, that the rooms will possibly have a slanted floor, are small and have a random assortment of chairs! Many of the staircases in the buildings and steep and do not have disabled access. 

The buildings are architecturally stunning, and the cobbled street really does top it off. Located in the street is the University's Career Service and furthermore many smaller departments are located in the street (including the department of Scottish History). 

Parking is available, but you have to pay during the day and normally it is very busy. Also, some students are lucky enough to have flats on this road, so private leases are available. 

A great street, and one which is admired by all who walk through it.",4
Local Flavor,"Buccleuch Place is another Edinburgh University hub. It's tucked right behind George Square, and is where most students have tutorials, or where the academics' offices are. 

This square is where the old buildings still stand. The University didn't manage to get to it and replace the buildings with modernist 60s concrete blocks. At least on the side closest to the Meadows. The other side is where the David Hume Tower, the George Square Library and the old anthropology building live. 

There isn't much else there but academic offices, Rotato and Press Coffee, though both Rotato and Press Coffee used to be great little independent shops: Press Coffee being a former second-hand bookshop and Rotato, the former vegetarian cafe called Harlequins, where they made the best sandwiches and the best soup.",4
Local Flavor,"Yeah, yeah there's all kinds of character going on here. The streets are cobbled and the building feel totally unsafe as all buildings full of character should. And it was a nice place for the English department before we got our swanky new facilities. AND there's Press Coffee and Rotato at the end, both excellent. 

However, there is something I noticed which always struck me as a bit odd. All the old buildings that house the various departments have steps to get up to them. Some of them are in the basement, so they have steps down. And it's only the careers service that has a wheelchair lift. So basically, if you're in a wheelchair you can get advice about your career but you can't learn to get the qualifications you require. It all seems a bit weird. Aside from that, it's a lovely street, but that surely has to be rectified?",3

Public Services & Government,"After staying in Edinburgh for four years I finally visited the area of Portobello. And after that initial visit I have always advised people to pay it a visit. 

Located on the coast, next door to its neighbour Leith, Portobello is home to Edinburgh's only beach. The beach is long, sandy (a rarity in some parts of Scotland) and is always busy when the sun comes out. On top of this, the buildings that hug the surrounding area around the beach can only be admired. Many are from the Victorian area and add to the beauty of the area. It seems an area where you can chill out and feel the sea breeze! On top of this, the high street which is set around the town hall has all the local shops you will need and has a good selection of bars, little cafes and restaurants. 

Portobello is quite a distance away from Edinburgh but Lothian buses provide a good range of services which stop every twenty minutes or so and take you up to the city centre. 

The area has defiantly improved over recent years and is certainly one of Edinburgh's best spots to visit.",4
Public Services & Government,"Portobello is well worth a visit, especially in the Summer time, as in the Winter it can look a bit depressing. In the Summer I love cycling from the city centre, down past Arthurs seat, through Duddingston Village and into Portobello, the route is very picturesque and is also walkable as well and takes about an hour and a half to do it, if you walk at a leisurely pace. If you are feeling lazy however, as Matthew says, there are lots of buses that go from the city centre to Portobello.
When the sun comes out, people from the centre of the city flock here and it has very much a traditional British seaside resort to the area with the beach front equipped with the standard amusement arcades, ice cream vans, fish and chip shops and pubs and bars.
The beach itself is nice, but I would advise walking a bit to the south of Portobello as this part of the beach can get a bit dirty. In the centre of Portobello itself, there are loads of pubs and bars and you will be spoilt for choice on where to eat.",4
Public Services & Government,"This sea side town just outside of Edinburgh (yes it is part of it but only of Greater Edinburgh) is a joy to visit. The houses are grand and the shops are small. The main attraction is obviously the beach and this is what my review is mostly about.

The white sand area has several bars and amusement halls and is flanked by the promenade that runs from Joppa to Leith (ish). 
It mostly received blue flags (clean beach)

The whole year round you can set foot here and there is a seasonal reason for visiting. In the Spring & Summer it is all about visiting the beach for a spot of sunbathing and a swim. Many people will have their children and dogs out. You can enjoy a picnic or even a BBQ on the beach. There will be events all over the beach - like volleyball, canoeing, jet skiing, windsurfing and kite sailing. Be aware that the beach will be packed! In the autumn it is mostly used for walks (with dogs), kites and runners (either beach or promenade) - the winter is for the foolhardy and campfires are not unheard of - especially during Hogmanay. 

Great fun in the winter as you will see many snowmen on the beach (when there is snow) - which makes for great pictures. 

The high street has many shops that are mostly independent retailers and delicatessen shops. There is a great community feel. 

It is a great addition to the wonderful city of Edinburgh and if you can visit.",4
Public Services & Government,"I love a wee trip to Porty! Yep, its got a beach and that bracing sea air, but it also has the feel of a wee seaside town but with some cute cafes and restaurants, as well as little independent shops.

I come down to meet friends in Malvarosa - a cute, authentic tapas bar on the High Street. On a sunny day, just squint and imagine you are on the Costas, supping a post beach treat of some tapas and wine. I also love Findlay's the butchers. Fab for gluten free meats and goodies, normally off limits. I make regular trips here for black pudding and haggis. All Findlay's black puds are now GF and they have some fab sausages available too. There are usually samples out if you have the munchies.

Banana Republic is great for fruit and veg. Its very popular with locals, with all fruit and veggies out front so you can see what is available before you buy. Like all traditional towns, there are little sweet shops, full of all the treats you used to have in a 10p mixture.

On a sunny day, the beach is fab. Hit it right, then grab a spot for some sunbathing in the sand. Leave it too late and you find it hard to get a spot and the winds get up about 3ish so it can be a tad cold. It's a man made beach so its lovely sand rather than shingle. Even on a cold day, you can go for a long walk along the promenade.

So if you've not done it before, what's stopping you from checking out Porty? The number 26 heads out here what seems like every 10 minutes at peak times and although parking does seem to be a mare, in reality, you usually can grab a spot.",4
Local Flavor,"The Mound, at first does not appear to be one of Edinburgh's landmarks, but if you take a closer look it certainly is. 

This part of the city connects the Old Town with the New Town. And believe it or not, this hill is actually artificial and was created in the eighteenth century. Since, then the Mound has moved on with it being home to a number of landmark buildings. The Bank of Scotland has its headquarters here, the Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland is located here as well as the National Gallery of Scotland. 

The Mound is quite busy with traffic normally and is very popular with tourists making their way to the Royal Mile. The walk up the Mound is quite steep, but when you get near the top you get magnificent views of Edinburgh, including Princes Street and its gardens. 

Well worth the walk I think!",4
Local Flavor,"I had no idea the Mound was artificial. Matthew is a fountain of knowledge!

I thought it had existed as one of Edinburgh's many hills for centuries, but obviously not. So we can thank the Victorians for the crazy ascent towards the Royal Mile, but at least it's good for the legs and I actually still love the Mound.

With its road and many staircases that wind their way up towards the Royal Mile, the Mound also has the massive, gothic image of the Aseembly building on it. If you find yourself down a side street, there are also smaller museums such as the Writer's Museum situated on your way to the top.

A steep walk but rewarding, as when you get to the top you find oodles of shops and a stunning view of the city. And if you can't bear the daunting steps or hike in front of you, it's a nice sight to see from the bottom.",4
Local Flavor,It's steep so you get some good exercise going up the Playfair Steps. The Assembly towering up is very impressive and you can see down over the Scottish National Gallery and Princes Street. I really hate it in the winter when it's icey though.,3

Local Flavor,"Cockburn Street's the quirkiest street in Edinburgh, and not only by virtue of its name. So, yes, in Scottish it's pronounced Coe-burn. By the by. Though this doesn't at all change the fact that it's a hilarious sounding name. And there isn't an anglophone tourist who comes to town who doesn't have a chuckle or three about this street name. 

Cockburn's the home of Avalanche, Swish, Cookie, the Baked Potato Shop and other pretty businesses. It's also completely unavoidable as it's the quickest route from Waverley to Old Town. It's the windiest street, and its the one that features most heavily in Hallam Foe.",4
Local Flavor,"Like Julia, I tend not to tire of referring to Cock-Burn street by it's phonetic pronunciation, which sounds slightly like the kind of ailment you'd find after getting a bit carried away down Lothian Road. It's one of the streets I know best in Edinburgh but a trip here is always tinged with sadness as I remember Fopp and Uber-Disko, which have sadly now made way for a drugs information clinic and whatever is currently a couple of doors down from Avalanche. I forget.

Retail has to move with the times however and while I do miss my old favourites, I'm glad to see that quirky and oddball stores such as Cutie House and Supa Kuru have come in to brighten up the place rather than the usual soulless dross.

Fantastic ice-cream at Toddle Inn as well, and in Underground Solu'shn, at least one store is keeping the ""crisp biscuits"" alive.",5
Local Flavor,"Cockburn Street is one of Edinburgh's best known streets! It curves its way from the Royal Mile down to Market Street and is a favourite with tourists. 

With Avalanche records, the Baked Potato Shop and Who's Who, this street has plenty of good quirky places to visit. However, over the years the tacky Scottish tourist shops have started to invade this street, however only few a there so far. 

The street always seems to have a buzzing atmosphere. Indeed, the street connects to Flesh market close, the hundred odd steps up to the Royal Mile (and the Real Mary King's Close), so it is a place where people come together from different closes and side streets! 

Certainly worth a visit!",4
Local Flavor,"Like Gavin, I like referring to Coe-burn street as Cock-burn... I know, I'm mature. Cockburn Street will always be one of my favourite streets in Edinburgh as when I was a teenager, Cockburn would always be the street than I would spend hours on with friends whenever we visited Edinburgh. We'd spend ages trawling through Cookie, Pie in The Sky and The Cutie House to get some quirky clothing and cool stationery.

Cockburn stands out from other streets in Edinburgh as it's home to small independent stores all the way up. Nowadays, I feel like I've grown out of many of the shops and many of them are definitely aimed at teens but I still love checking out The Cutie House as I'm a sucker for stationery.

Definitely worth a visit, Cockburn street will always hold a place in my heart.",5
Local Flavor,"It's refreshing to see that almost everyone else here uses this street as an excuse to say cock in public, but despite this obvious advantage, Cockburn Street is a really cool variation from the standard high streets that litter Edinburgh. It markets itself as the 'alternative street', with the shops reflecting that. You've got Whiplash Trash, which is a weird mix between a piercing studio, a gothic clothes shop and a bong shop, Cookie, which has some kooky clothes on offer, and a dying institution in Britain: the great 1p sweet shop. Yes Ladies and Gentlemen, down the bottom there's a shop that still sells all those old style sweets in the bi ol' jars. It. Is. Awesome.

They also have a few other kinda skateboarder-y / alternate clothing shops, like Route One and a gothic shop opposite Whiplash Trash. At the top you've got a really cool clothes shop in Fabrick, that lets you choose your tshirt / hoodie etc and put your own design to it. 

As well as this you have Viva Mexico which is an amazing Mexican restaurant; Ruang Thai is just off it which is pretty good as well. If you're in the mood for a few drinks then you've got the potentially lethal Secret Arcade just off the main street. 

A really nice alternative to the standard high streets filled with Topshops and H&Ms.",5
Local Flavor,"Winding down a hill...
From train to mile without steps...
Is photographic...",4
Local Flavor,"Ahh, Cockburn Street, my picturesquely twisting friend, what delights you hold!

Cockburn Street is pretty much top of my list for present shopping, due to its abundance of cute'n'kooky little shops. It's just the right side of sketchy - some of its establishments look a little seedy but in a colourful and good-natured manner, while others are cute and bubbly.

As a street, it's a real picture. Old, cobbled, and winding in a tight curl from High Street to Market Street, walking down it feels like scooting down a shop-lined version of Moonface's Slippery Slip in the Magic Faraway Tree books. Dark closes challenge you with endless steps to left and right, where if you just pick one randomly, you might find a shortcut, or you might add several minutes and a potential cardiac arrest to your journey.

It's also one of the streets that gets gritted in snowy conditions so it's among the less perilous of the Old Town's winter attractions.",5
Restaurants,"Like most cafes in an office building, their primary selling point is convenience.  They make good sandwiches, but there is generally only one offering at the buffet.  When, you factor in the time it would take to drive or later walk to other options, going here can make sense.  The staff is definitely pleasant.",3
Restaurants,"I like this place not only because it is most conveniently located in the building I work, but also because of fresh and tasty food. They have good variety in food and serve Starbucks coffee too. Staff is very pleasant. They are definitely one of the reasons for so many regulars here. Place is very well maintained.",4
Restaurants,Ariel and Adrian take care of me here. They know what my usual is and always greet me with a hello and a smile. They are super friendly. Prices are reasonable. Of course to echo everyone else's sentiment that the location is convenient. I just wish that Outtakes stayed open later. It closes at 3 and the grill closes at 2:45- so get your order in before then and you'll be square!,3
Local Flavor,"Hmmmm, I'm not sure if I agree completely with all those 'I Love Leith' banners that the council have hung everywhere.

Don't get me wrong, there are lots of great things about Leith. Ocean Terminal, for one, where you can shop 'til you drop without getting rained on. Not to mention loads of little independent one-off shops and delis like Pani Solinska and The Cat's Miaou, as well as some of the city's finest Fish restaurants like Fishers.

And I'm sure in a few years it will be the 'up and coming' trendy area for young professionals that everyone keeps banging on about. But at the moment, it's still more than a little bit rough round the edges. There are more Cash Converter type places in this neck of the woods than I've seen anywhere else in the city, promising to cash your cheques instantly and give you a payday advance. Yeah right. Also, don't be offended if you walk down the street at night in a short skirt and everyone thinks you're a prostitute. It's probably less of a reflection on you and more on the fact that every other female fitting that description is in fact on the game.",3
Local Flavor,"t's a funny old place is Leith. I mean it's home to some of the finest restaurants in Edinburgh. Martin Wishart is on The Shore, while The Kitchen is party of the ultra-cool Commercial Street complex, both of which are Michelin starred. It's also got some great bars and shops among other things. The top of Leith walk boasts the Playhouse and the Omni centre. 

Yet just a short way down Leith walk and it all feels a bit dangerous. It's run down in a lot of places. The Tesco on Brunswick Place is horrendous - when I went in there I counted 5 security guards. I mean, isn't that just perpetuating the problem?

It's definitely worth a look, and the walk down to the Water of Leith is brilliant on a sunny day. There are loads of seating areas looking out to the water, which makes for a great thinking spot. Just keep checking for your wallet.",3
Local Flavor,"Only a 20 minute walk.. (downhill) from Edinburgh, not a lot of things to do or see unless you are only going there to see the Royal Britannia and a shopping mall.  It is good to get a different perspective of Edinburgh but that's really about it.  Very underdeveloped and has potential to be a triving dockland IF monies are pumped into it.",3
Local Flavor,"i'm a little disheartened to see that a number of reviews about leith are only a 3 star rating :(  leith has been my home for a considerable amount of time and frankly i think it is pretty awesome (which makes sense or i would have moved to another part of edinbrugh by now).

Having moved to the ocean terminal area of leith about 5.5 years ago i had never even realised this part of town existed.  but once i knew, i was in love.  leith has been through a major revitalisation and the place is fun of trendy bars, cafes, and a few michelin starred restaurants.  there are also loads of new build flats mixed in with the older tenaments and a huge shopping centre with a 24 hour gym, spa, cinema, and a variety of shops.

but the leith area is far more than the shore and ocean terminal, there is the main artery of leith walk that runs through it and all the wee side streets coming off of that.  from these you can access a number of parks and cycle paths including the water of leith walkway which is a beautiful stroll on a sunny day.  there are also loads of places to eat including the famous la favourita with the wood fired pizzas (delicious!!), the lovely gaia specialising in sicilian food and good coffee, los cardos with its delicious tex mex goodness, and the sicilian bakery that i've told is the best place to buy baked goods in the city.  the place also has fantastic transport links as i can literally get anywhere in the city by hopping on a bus.

i feel like i could go on and on about my love for leith, but even having lived there for years there are still places i've yet to find and try!  just another reason to love the place even more, always something new to stumble upon.  so i think perhaps these lower reviews haven't been fairly given and maybe it's time to give leith's its due.  it's a part of edinburgh that's got loads to offer and is a fabulous place to live!",5
Local Flavor,"I Love Leith.
The place is different than Edinburgh, it has its own character and vibe. 
Yes, there are clear opposites in classes. 

There are your Community Council Schemes, Halfway Houses and don't get me started on the 'Banana Flats' or 'Little Beirut' 
As in the same breath I need to mention 'Commercial Quay', 'The Shore', 'Leith Links Park'  and the 'Water of Leith'.

You'll find plenty of bars, restaurants & sandwich shops. 
Some are very upmarket and others..errm..not so. 

What you cannot fault in Leith is the variety of local characters. From your business owners to buggy mums, from professionals to the local pushers. They all tend to know (about) each other. 

There are plenty more ASBO's then MBE's, but they all live in the same area.

Noticeable are the many, many great restaurants and bars that are in they whole area. Martin Wishart, The Plumes Horse, Kitchin, Kings Wark, Sofi's, Vintage, Manna Bakery, The Sicilian Pastry Shop, Stack Dim Sum, La Favourita, Chop Chop, Bond 9, Victoria, Woodland Creatures, Cameo, Kuruchi 2 etc..

and you'll have the offset with bars like the Tam o'Shanter, Foot of the Walk, The Kings Head, which at times seem to attract the more seedier part of the area.

This is a place of community & contrast. And I love it.",4
Local Flavor,Lots of new shops have popped up recently and i must find a day to go and explore as this evening evening there is no time and they are all shut!  No suprise there!  There is lots to explore here including the mush talked about drill hall - which yes i still have to explore too!  time is not on my side as the list of things to do just keep getting longer!!,4
Local Flavor,"Leith is getting better and better. Some places have gone and other's have taken their place. bond 9 is now Wolf & Water. Chop Chop is gone and the Kitchin has expanded into their premises. The Vintage is still owned by the William Brothers, but let VDeep indian tapas run it. A new barber arrived last year 'Shortcut to the Shore' and the empty space on commercial quay is now cafe tartin! old favourites are doing well. Sofi's is as strong as ever and easter road is beautifying itself. I like it more, so would you!",4
Local Flavor,"I'm surprised a review hasn't been written on Marchmont. Mainly because there's nowhere in Edinburgh that feels more like a village within a city than Marchmont. Actually, no, that's not true. Stockbridge wins that, but only because they have the Waters of Leith there, and we don't. 

Marchmont is effectively a wee student slash boho community in the middle of the city. By middle of the city I mean the edge of the city because the further south you head from Marchmont, the more residential it gets, until the city finally tapers off.

Plus, Marchmont's just on the edge of the Meadows and about a ten minute walk from anywhere in Old Town. I mean, where else could you possibly want to live, right?",5
Local Flavor,"Marchmont is where I spent my second year in a flat overlooking the meadows. If you are an arts student at Edinburgh Uni, then this is the place to be, you can be out of bed and in your lecture theatre within 15 minutes, 10 at a push. What's more, when it is sunny, then you have a huge expanse of grass on your doorstep to lay and frolic on.
If you need to go to the Kings Building, like my flatmate was, then it is quite a bit less convenient and takes about 25-30 minutes to get there, and that's if you are walking fast. Another drawback about the area is that there is no big supermarket around, even the ones on Nicolson Street, really aren't that big, so I found that I tended to shop online and this actually worked out pretty well.
Marchmont is a student hotspot and you can feel that you are in a student bubble with all the local businesses tailored to you needs, which is handy, but you do lose a little bit of character that you find in other parts of town.",4
Local Flavor,"With rows of tawny-coloured tenements, massive student population, a surfeit of artsy cafés and independent grocery stores, Marchmont's vibe falls somewhere between bohemian and genteel.  It's bordered by the Meadows on one side, and the wealthy mansions of the Grange on the other, and has its own character as a fairly sleepy residential neighbourhood, disturbed only by the occasional blaring music of student flat parties. 

When I lived here, I loved its smallness, and the village-like quality - the fact that, whenever I left my flat, I'd meet someone I knew, and could survive for days at a time without ever venturing across the Meadows, getting all I needed from the cornershop, having a pint in the Argyle down the road, renting DVDs from Alphabet, and generally shying away from the outside world.

Now that I've moved away, I feel slightly relieved to have escaped this insular community.  Still, I'll always have a soft spot for Marchmont's leafy streets and turreted tenements.",3
Local Flavor,"One of the things I love about Edinburgh is that, despite it being a capital city, it feels like lots of little villages all stuck together. Wee pockets of shops, bars, restaurants and communities all stitched together, higgeldy-piggeldy back-to-back with no real semblance of order into a beautiful patchwork that we like to call Embru.

Marchmont is my wee square on that giant patchwork. It's the only part of the city I've known to live in, and it'll forever be my first love of Edinburgh. When I was moving through here, at least 6 people recommended I move to Marchmont specifically. Thinking it would be of a similar scale to ""the West End"" of Glasgow, it turns out it's not much more than a few wee streets accumulating around a Scotmid and a few cafés, and overlooking the Meadows. And comes with complimentary mice in every flat, how lovely.

It's really quite a small area, mainly residential. Just off of Nicholson Street (or South Clerk Street, or whatever that street is called at this stage) it over looks the Meadows and probably ends 3/4 of the way across the Meadows when it becomes Bruntsfield (the older, slightly more refined and better dressed big sister) and is bordered by the grand-parents of The Grange (elegance in the form of Victorian manors).

As a tourist or visitor to the city, Marchmont isn't an area I would recommend they must visit. Not like The Grassmarket or even Bruntsfield (which is still quite residential). It's mainly flats, and mainly for students. I'm not a student but feel quite comfortable in the studenty-feel (although more postgrads than undergrads I'd wager). There are one or two absolutely hidden gems, which I'm about to reveal. 

Anyone should seek out Marchmont purely for Sweet Melindas, sitting right next to the famed Eddie's Fishmarket. Sweet Melindas is a fish restaurant, hidden behind vast red curtains and a 'blink and you'll miss it' type joint, but one of my favourite Edinburgh restaurants.

Then, for my everyday enjoyment, there's the Warrender Swim Centre conveniently close to either Toast or Black Medicine Co for a post-swim smoothie or brunch and always Candy Cupcake for a sweet treat.

My other favourite thing about this area is the abundance of fresh fruit, veg and produce stores. There are around 4 on one street or corner, all selling super cheap, super fresh fruit and veg, and two health food stores. Quite random for a wee 'hood but I'm not complaining.

Of course, sitting on the Meadows makes it aesthetically and, perhaps spiritually(?), one of the loveliest places to be in my biased opinion. Snow scattered over the Meadows in the winter for a blissfully countryside-urban living, the Ladyboys of Bangkok blaring out Robbie Williams on a nightly basis for a whole month during the Festivals for a bright lights vegas feel in our wee big city.

If you live here, you're bound to fall in love with it. It's not got the elegance of the Grange, the polished look of Bruntsfield and is certainly not as well organised or presented as anywhere in New Town. It's the definition of residential living in the Old Town. And I love it.",4
Local Flavor,"Marchmont has been my home the whole time I have lived in Edinburgh. In that time I've found it is both student and mice infested, and at points very rarely strayed into the heart of it.

But in recent months there have been a few new openings, relaunches and refurbs to make it a neighbourhood I'm proud of.

Starting with the basics, the Scotmid has refurb'd and wooooo boy is it swish. Seriously, go check it out. There's a fresh orange juice machine, there's 4 different types of salami, there's loads of fresh bread (rye, rye cross bloomer, sourdough, roasted garlic). For such a small supermarket store it packs a lot in.

Then there's the swimming pool. The walk here takes me through the heart of Marchmont, so I can admire it all. A lovely wee local swimming bath, that's mainly frequented by families with kids and an older generation. So it makes for a pleasant, quiet swim on a Friday morning.

Then there's the newly taken-over Argyle Bar. This used to be the most-avoided business in Marchmont, and I'd wager it's going to now be one of the most frequented. Great local bar, reason alone to make your way to Marchmont.

And then there's The Institute coffee shop. Having spoken to a barista at Artisan Roast, they were praising The Institute, and the guy who owns it, to the high heavens of coffee beans. And apparently there are nude photos of the baristas at Artisan Roast on the walls of the Institute. Either way, this is a proper local coffee shop with cake and scones and attitude.

There's also a few brunch spots like Toast, coffee shop like Black Medicine, a few other bars (Earl of Marchmont). It's pretty small. I'm not lauding it up as somewhere to visit. But as somewhere to live, it has that perfect village feel which is very homely. You walk down the street and always see someone you know, and at the same time you have the whole of Edinburgh on your doorstep just across the Meadows.",5
Local Flavor,"I have lived in various parts of town since I've been in the 'burgh' and only moved Marchmont almost a year ago.
Despite its reputation of being 'studentville', Marchmont is actually quite a lovely residential area in the middle of the city, with families and professionals.  And I certainly cannot complain about students' parties.  I actually really enjoy being is such a nice and quiet area, just about 10 min walk from the city centre.
Marchmont has a number of lovely shops - fishmonger, deli, art gallery, recently refurbished convenience Scotmid - as well as quite a lot of coffee shops and pubs, considering the size of the area.  The most recent addition is the Cellar Monkey (part of the Monkey Brass group) which I yet have to explore.
There is also a swimming pool and a gym, refurbished only a few years ago.
Finally, one of the best things about living in Marchmont is the proximity of the Meadows, whether it's for a jog, a game of frisbee or a barbecue.  How nice to have such a great front garden!",4
Local Flavor,"Having lived all over the city I always had a hankering to get back to Marchmont. I really love this place its quiet, the meadows is on you door step and it is really well provided for. 

Shopping: We have the best fruit and veg shops in Edinburgh that I have found along Argyle place and Argyle street. These guys offer an array of the usual fruit and veg with some exotics chucked in. There is an excellent local butcher and of course Eddies fish mongers to accompany this. There is even a health food shop called the new leaf selling all sorts of veggie/ vegan friendly foods and ethical produce. They also sell Mrs Unis veggie haggis pakora for the ultimate post night out weird food cravings. For the more everyday kind of needs we have Margiottas and a Scotmid times two. I rarely leave Marchmont for food shopping infact can pretty much stay on my block all weekend. The only thing missing for me is somewhere to buy specific south east asia ingredients, but East cross causeway and Causewayside are a short walk. 

Eating out: A plethora of cafes have popped up over the last few years from sandwich shops to sit in coffee shops to compliment some of the businesses that have been in situe for years. My Favourites are Freemans, No39 and Cafe artista. When it come to take away food I am a creature of habit and kasbah has been my go to for the last decade or more in fact I used to grab food in there when it was called k2 around 1998/1999. More recently I have really taken to Delicious Italian for pizza. For chinese food there are seferal options, but I always default to GY for salt and chilli tofu. 

Bars: For bars we have 2 local bars in the Earl of Marchmont and the Argyle, plus a hotel bar in the Links Hotel. The Argyle was renovated last year under a new ownership and its is a great place to grab that post work beer or drift your way through a lazy Sunday with some nachos and a pint. Never really took to the Earl, but check the reviews on here many folk seem to like it. The Links hotel is great and my first choice to sit outside on that thing rarier than a nessie sighting a sunny day in Scotland. 

What to do: Everything is on your door step so a wander around the meadows, walk into town or go for a swim at the warrendar baths at the south end of the area.",5
Local Flavor,"I've been spending a lot of time in Marchmont lately and it has left me wishing I'd lived there as a student. Though to be fair that was a looooong time ago and I think Marchmont has recently gotten even better.

Full of green grocers, cafes, old school funky shops, eateries and local pubs it is small and cute and independent. 

It's also so close to the greenery of the meadows and of course from there just a hop into old and new towns.",5
Local Flavor,"During my recent trip to Montreal, Rue Prince-Arthur Est was one of my favourite destinations.  This little strip is pedestrian only in the summertime and offers tourists (and maybe even locals alike) a nice stroll with restaurants and shops all in one location.  

They may not be the fanciest of places, but they are certainly better than heading down to the tourist traps of Old Montreal.  Another interesting tidbit about Rue Prince-Arthur Est is that most restaurants are BYOB (Bring your own bottle).  You will see myriads of people walking along from the convenience shops with bottles wrapped up in brown paper taking them to the restaurants.  Makes it nice to save a bit of money and get your favourite libation in the process!",4
Local Flavor,"Dead street, don't come here ! So sad ! One of the only pedestrian streets in Montreal is almost dead ! I've been living for the past 15 years near Prince Arthur street and I walk here everyday. But, let's be honest here, it's no more the '80 with all the BYOW greek restaurants all over with their terrasses, now 90% of the restaurants/shops are now closed, so sad. You got left only 2 french restaurants, 2 greek restaurants, 2 convenience stores, 1 supermarket, 1 bar, 1 pizza stand, 1 shoes store & Café Campus and that's about it. The City of Montreal should start thinking or planning something to improve the business here, decrease taxes or replan this street with new urban planning or arts, I don't know... It's very depressing but it's the reality of many ''once'' popular street like St-Laurent or St-Denis, people don't come here anymore, because there is no space to park, new ''hot'' neighborhoods in town and people from the suburs prefer to go to DIX-30 or elsewhere. On the top, the city of Montreal plans to reconvert Ste-Catherine into a street pedestrian in the future...",2
Local Flavor,"One of Edinburgh's charms is the way that it sometimes seems to contain completely different worlds, packed on top of each other, crammed together within the space of one city yet retaining their own distinctive character.

So it is that, within minutes of leaving the commercial hustle and bustle of Princes Street, you can dip beneath Thomas Telford's Dean Bridge and find yourself in Dean Village, a serene and picturesque haven that seems incredibly distant from the city centre, in time as well as space.  Stretching along the Water of Leith between Stockbridge and the West End, it is an area full of quaint, fairy-tale like houses that were once the homes of mill workers when the grain trade was one of Edinburgh's main industries.  

You can still see the site of the original mill and the water wheel that powered it, but, in contrast to the past when it must have been a hive of activity, these days it is incredibly quiet, so that it almost feels like a secret hidden away below the rest of the city.",4
Local Flavor,"Dean Village is, perhaps, my favourite place in Edinburgh. 

Only ten minutes walk from the west end of Princes Street, but feeling miles away, it is a hidden gem full of quaint former mill buildings, tenements and Tudor revivals. In the height of tourist season it is surprisingly quiet, a welcome oasis from the hussle and bussle.

Approach it along the Water of Leith from Stockbridge and you walk beneath the towering Thomas Telford-designed Dean Bridge, past a former Victorian fives court, and a pretty yellow mill building which was subsequently acquired by St Mary's Cathedral in the West End (look up, and you see a bell was added to the roof). This takes you to the lovely bridge where you can look back at Dean Bridge and down the river towards the more recent (1990s) Swiss-style apartments. Keep an eye out for the local heron, who often stops here to hunt for food!

Until the 1950s there were many shops in the village, but there are none now. Not even a pub. But this is no loss (after all, if you want those you only have a short walk up Bells Brae to Queensferry Street).

The jewel in the crown of Dean Village is Well Court, built as housing for local workers by the proprietor of The Scotsman newspaper in the 1880s. It is breathtakingly beautiful. How I'd love to live there! Walk into the courtyard and admire the lovely clock tower building then take the pathway to its right which takes you to the tiny rose gardens. Here there are two benches where you can sit and take in the scenery and listen to the gentle trickling of the water beneath you. Past the baptismal font (rescued from a local church) - an outside christening was held here once - and you come to a small metal bridge that takes you up to the modern apartments. Walk under this and you are taken along past the weir and, eventually, the Aids memorial until you get to an entrance to the Gallery of Modern Art.

If you'd like to learn more about the area, the local monthly tours (run by deanvillage.org) are essential. They only cost £3 and last 90 minutes. The tour guides certainly know their stuff and are full of fascinating facts (eg. Dean Bridge is hollow and you can actually walk around inside it).",5
Local Flavor,"Ok, I bow down to Ben M's reviewing skills on this one, because next to him, I feel like I have no knowledge of this place beyond the feeling of if I could bear-hug an entire neighbourhood - it would likely be Dean Village.

I got lost here a lot when I first moved to the city. Not lost in general - I got lost in Dean Village... a lot. Or more specifically, I got lost and ENDED UP in Dean Village. Why? Because I live in Stockbridge and still live under the belief that the Water of Leith will always steer me in the right direction...

Let me tell you, of all the places i've discovered and re-discovered while getting lost my first few months in the city, this is HANDS DOWN the most charming. Honestly, Edinburgh tourism should erect a sign in Stockbridge that says: 

""Love this super charming, off the beaten path village-feeling neighbourhood just minutes from the city center? SURPRISE! Walk five minutes down this garden pathway and find another wwaayy cuter version of the same thing! Then start looking up real estate, because you're obviously never leaving.""

Except 1. that sign would be lengthy and dumb and 2. part of the charm of Dean Village is no one seems to know it's there.

But now you do, whoever is reading this. So you should go read Ben's WAY more informative Yelp review on it and then wander through here with a coffee in hand and feel what it's like to want to bear-hug a neighbourhood.",5
Local Flavor,"You maybe wondering what you should do after eating your fill at a local pub ... well, take a stroll over to Dean Village! It's very walkable from the city center (~15min). The village itself is picturesque and tranquil - and the entire experience is like watching frames from a movie. It'll definitely be worth your time. Go go go!",5
Local Flavor,"Lovely little part of the city, with gorgeous buildings and tremendous views along the Water of Leith. I don't know much about what services are available in the area, as I tend to come only for walks along the water, surrounded by nice trees and peaceful silence. 

Dean Village has plenty of photo ops and is worth a stop for that alone. If you like architecture, rivers, trees, and/or walking, this is the place for you.",4
Local Flavor,"Just a heads up. - Ben M's review sums up the Dean Village magnificently, as Jody B says in her review too.

Having lived in Stirling for over five years, I explored so many amazing, scenic areas during my stay. Often a cycle journey away, and with not a soul in sight, these evening adventures satisfied my curious, adventurous streak. My outdoor adventures in Stirling played a huge part in why I came to love the town so much. Now, living in Edinburgh, I'd missed the magic of exploration. Dean Village more than satisfied that longing.

We are nighthawks when it comes to walking. There is something exciting about getting out when most are settling down. We didn't see a single person on our travels and Dean Village felt huge and lonesome; like it belonged to us for just a few hours. Come nightfall, Dean Village is magical. So close to the city, and yet so utterly different.

You will see some lovely sights. My favourite part is the waters, which were high and fast after high rainfall. I forget just how close we are to the water and this is a reminder to me that nature is only a short walk away and always worth revisiting. 

It's worth mentioning that parts of Leith walk are currently closed due to flooding and landslides.",5
Local Flavor,"Petit village hors du temps. A quelques minutes du centre historique d'Edinburgh, ce village vous transporte à travers l'espace temps.

Après une journée à déambuler dans la ville entre lieux touristiques et pubs, nous voulions découvrir un endroit un peu plus paisible, les parcs n'étant pas à leur apogée en hiver, le village de Dean Village nous est apparu comme une évidence.

Le village semble coupé du monde, on s'y ballade au gré des ruelles pavées en suivant la rivière Water of Leight. La verdure est omniprésente et l'architecture pittoresque. Un véritable petit poumon d'oxygène dans la ville.",4
Local Flavor,"I wouldn't exactly put this odd little monument along the Water of Leith Walkway on a list of must-see destinations in Edinburgh, but it's a piece of local history that may hold some interest for anyone into sacred sites or, erm, old wells.

It's connected to a legend about 12th century saint, and in the 18th century people flocked here to partake of the water's supposed healing properties, which is when the small neo-classical temple dedicated to the goddess of health was erected.

There's not much to see here today, but it is open to the public on Sundays if you feel like taking a look.",3
Local Flavor,"Located in the Stockbridge neighbourhood of Edinburgh (just 15 minutes outside of the city centre), is a round classical style ""temple"" that you can simply gaze upon or walk up to and visit. 

This odd monument sits atop a well which it was supposedly rediscovered in 1760 by three Heriot's school boys, after centuries of obscurity. Due to the popularity of  ""taking in the waters"" which was believed to cure everything from light bruising to certain death, this Well forced Stockbridge into the tourist books. Legend says that Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, the founder of the Cistercian Order, in the 12th Century found the well by following birds, and used its healing powers to restore his lost strength. 

Anyway a pretty groovy local landmark that's completely free and well worth a visit if you're in the area (especially as it's free!)",4
Local Flavor,"If you're checking out Edinburgh, I probably wouldn't put this on the must-see list, however if you're in the Stockbridge area its certainly worth a nice walk along the Water of Leith where you will come across St Bernards Well. 

Now I don't know too much about the history (but I'm sure you could Google that yourself), but its a peaceful area and a beautiful walk that will take you towards the city centre or Dean village.",5
Local Flavor,"I don't know very much about the labyrinth in George Square Gardens.  I can't tell you when it was built, or by who, or for what purpose.  I just know that it's kind of cool, a little concrete maze in the middle of the park where you can wander on the twisty paths.  

There is probably supposed to be a spiritual or contemplative dimension to the experience you have here, as a place for reflection. Or something.  Anyway, it's open to anyone, so you're free to make of it what you will.",4
Local Flavor,"Aesthetically speaking, there's nothing particularly wrong about the Labyrinth in George Square Gardens. It's just that I plain don't understand the point of its being there. Apart from for aesthetic reasons. But it, or the information around it, seems to claim it's more than just that. That it's useful for some soothing, spiritual... thing. And I just don't get that. I don't get it because I'm not quite sure how walking around in circles helps anyone relax. But hey, to each his own. Maybe they start feeling so dizzy that they somehow feel that they've reached a spiritual climax. Maybe they just like how the swirls look. It's for you to decide.",2
Local Flavor,"OK, it seems clear that the previous reviewers don't understand the mystery of labyrinths, so allow me to enlighten y'all...

 Labyrinths are hugely popular these days and are being constructed all over the world. They are really cool tools to work with to enhance your intuitive and spiritual development. Unlike a maze, which has many paths and choices to make, a labyrinth has only one path. Where a maze is an intellectual left-brain puzzle to be solved, a labyrinth is an intuitive, right-brain meditative experience. You don't have to make any decisions whilst walking the labyrinth, so the left-brain analytical side of your brain can take a nap and let your intuitive right-brain run things for a bit.
Many people find this a very therapeutic and healing experience, which is why a lot of labyrinths get installed in hospitals and hospices. People have claimed relief from arthritis, Parkinson's and many other ailments from regular labyrinth walking.
Often you can gain insight into a tricky problem or life decision by simply asking the question and then walking the labyrinth with an open heart and mind. There are many uses of the labyrinth.

Labyrinths are sacred spaces. Like the stone circles and henges of old, they are great places to hold ceremony and enhance your spiritual side. The act of walking the labyrinth actually creates subtle electrical changes in the brain as you move back and forth through the geomagnetic field of the Earth, resulting in a mild altered state - in much the same way as whirling dervishes or other ecstatic dancers create a similar effect by spinning or jumping up and down. At a bare minimum, you will feel less stressed and more relaxed mentally after walking a labyrinth.

There are several varieties of labyrinth, but the two most well-known are the 7-circuit Classical (sometimes called Cretan) labyrinth, and the 11-circuit medieval labyrinth, which is what we have here. This particular one is a replica of the labyrinth in Chartres Cathedral in France, which is the best-preserved surviving example of this type. The Medieval pattern is very popular in Christian circles because of the cross-quartered pattern, and it was popularised by Dr. Lauren Artress, the Canon of Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, who founded an organisation called Veriditas to train labyrinth facilitators. 

This particular labyrinth was commissioned by the former Chaplain of Edinburgh University, Di Williams, who is a Veriditas Trainer. It was built in 2004 by Dumfries-based land artist and labyrinthophile Jim Buchanan with the design assistance of the University's architect, using Portuguese granite setts and resin-impregnated gravel.

As a dowser and labyrinth consultant myself, I was the site geomancer on the project, which involved dowsing for the exact positioning of, the alignment and ceremonial activation of the labyrinth. It is sited on a power centre in the gardens - a spot where rising underground water combines with yang energy leys - a similar combination of energies is found at the altars of older churches and this is one of the main characteristics that defines sacred space.

Since it was constructed it has become a popular spot with students, local office workers and visitors alike. Walk it with open heart and mind, pay attention to your feelings and thoughts as you do so, and you'll soon be won over by the magic of the labyrinth.",5
Local Flavor,"George IV Bridge, which pretty much stretches between Bristo Square and the Royal Mile, is a very interesting street.  It contains a whole host of diverse shops, cafés and restaurants, as well as the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library and the Central Library, and that site of bewilderingly constant tourist interest, Greyfriars Bobby.

It also allows you to have the novel experience of walking into a building from street level, and then realising you['re actually standing on the 10th floor.  The NAtional Library of Scotland is an especially good example of this, as it has floors and floors of bookstacks stretching down to the Cowgate and below.  I think this is kind of cool, but sometimes it can give you a headaches and make you feel like you're in an M.C. Escher painting.",4
Local Flavor,"I've never been particularly impressed by George IVth Bridge. I mean, it's fine. There's nothing I particularly object to as far as this street's concerned, but there's nothing particularly spectacular about it: it hasn't got the quirk of Cockburn and Victoria Street, and neither is it as terrifying soulless as Princes Street. It's just a way to get from A to B. If you find there's someone who lives around this area, it's because it's very much in the center of Old Town, and you'll be about 2 minutes from anywhere, and 10 minutes from New Town (as opposed to the 20 or more that it takes to get to New Town from anything south of the Meadows). 

It's got its array of cafes (not really many shops here apart from the Christian book shop and Hilary's Bazaar), that range from terrible to decent. It's also the home of both the Central and National Libraries (that seem to face each other from across the street).",3
Local Flavor,"I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but this bridge doesn't seem to meet the criteria I expect in my bridges. Quite simply  it isn't a raised platform used to cross a chasm or body of water. It's actually a street, with a very small bridgey bit in the middle.

But oh, what a street. A fancy hotel at one end, and further down, in Salt and Pepper, Global and Meditteranean gate, it has some of the best sarnie shops you could imagine. Don't forget the evergreen Bar Kohl either, which may be in need a lick of paint these days but is still great.",5
Local Flavor,"Great cafes and shops...
Between The Mile and Uni...
A good night out too!",4
Local Flavor,"The best night out in Edinburgh for me. The selection of bars available are consistently high quality (Villager, Bar Kohl, Malones, Oz Bar) and even dappled with some cheesier fare (Revolution, Frankensteins) should you wish.

Restaurants are well-represented on the Bridge with Outsider and Grain Store both worth mentioning more than once. See also Oink, Bar Kohl (again, some of the best burgers in town), and Hotel Du Vin for some utterly unmissable food.

Site-wise, you have the National Museum (officially 2nd best in the UK), Greyfriars Bobby, the Mound. And with the Grassmarket a hundred feet away, you have all the historic glory of the Oldtown epitomised in one place. Such a beautiful area for the visualists out there.

No visit to Edinburgh is complete if you miss George IV Bridge.

Oh and blah blah blah, Harry Potter, blah blah blah....!",5
Local Flavor,"(This review is for Las Vegas ie: The Strip)

Went to Las Vegas on the weekend for a friends 30th B'day celebration.

It quickly dawned on me that LV is everything I hate about the USA in one location. Mindless gambling drones, drunk red-neck frat boys at 2 in the afternoon, plastic barbies, the excess of it all.

The one star is for the flight home.",1
Local Flavor,"I whole-heartedly agree with Patrick W.'s review of The Las Vegas Strip.  I recently went on a girl's trip to Vegas and soon discovered-verbatum-what Patrick describes.  I flew in to Vegas from Tucson, after a week of relaxing travel through Arizona - Scottsdale and Tucson - enjoying a couple spa trips along the way and seeing crazy wildlife (havalinas, coyotes, road runners, quail...) and soaking in the sun and serenity.  I deboarded the plane in Vegas and was immediately assaulted with visual and aural stimulation, vis a vis slot machines - flashing lights, bells, whistles and a slough of poor saps dumping their cash into these machines and getting nothing in return but the momentary thrill of the possibility of hitting ""the big one"".  And this is in the AIRPORT.  I immediately thought ""what the f*** have I gotten myself into"" and considered high-tailing it back to the plane.  BUT I sucked it up and joined my girlfriends and of course had a good time with THEM - dancing at the House of Blues, saw ""O""...which must stand for ""O My F-ing GOD, these tickets are EXPENSIVE!""  I'm definitely NOT a gambler...lost a whole ONE dollar on a slot machine (after sticking in my dollar and within 15 seconds it was just GONE...""ok, this BLOWS""...I did try my hand at black jack on the LAST day and walked away $15 richer!   And I must say I had one of the best massages EVER at the New York New York spa, but the effects of serenity there were soon vaporized when I had to walk through the NOISEY, SMOKEY casino to get back to my room.  -It angered me that they have it all figured out to the nth degree how best to take your money...I realized this when I arrived early at the NY NY hotel and had to wait for a friend for about an hour prior to checking in...I looked around the lobby...not ONE chair or bench or planter box to sit your butt down.  You had to either sit at the bar (where the machine is built into the bar right in front of you), or you have to sit at some lousy machine.  So the odds of you plunking in $$ while you wait are high...unless you're me.  I sat my ass down at the bar and ordered my one drink....and waited...patience of a Saint.  Another thing that irked me was that on the last day we were out lounging at the pool, enjoying some drinks and the sun, when we hear over a loud speaker ""the pool will be closing in 15 minutes"" - it was 4:45 in the pm.  They wanted to make sure to corale all the sunbathers back in to the casino to lose more money!  That was it for me.  It was that realization of how whorific that town is that I don't intend to ever go back.  The highlight of the trip was randomly seeing Diane Keaton strolling with a friend through the New York New York lobby right in front of me.  My first thought was, why in the hell of all places on Earth would Diane Keaton choose to be HERE??  I surmised it was either for an upcoming role, or she had been kidnapped.  Despite my disgust at the money churning machine that is Las Vegas and the fact that it is DEVOID of ANY culture whatsoever, I did have a great time with the girls, but for the money I'd rather go anywhere else in the world.  Even Tukwila.  The 1 star is because I haven't yet figured out how to give a negative 5 stars.",1
Local Flavor,"I sum up the previous two reviews with one word.
I do mean this in the most respectful way possible.
Ignoramuses.
How can you go to a city, let alone a state, built from the desert up on GAMBLING, and not EXPECT to see all of the things you detest so much?
Sorry.
Vegas has much of what I dislike also. 
All that beach, no ocean.  Sorry, none of the pools, including the wave pool at Mandalay, will ever match up.
Second hand smoke, the hardest water I've ever experienced, high crime rate, summer heat.
Vegas also has much of what I love.
Great food, around-the-clock living, Mt. Charleston snow, inexpensive real estate and cost of living, and from an unconfirmed source, about 100k expatriots from Hawaii now residing there.  
What this means for me is a much closer location than Oahu if I ever need to get my aloha tanks filled.
Some of the people I hold closest to my heart reside in Las Vegas.
Thats why I'll always go back.  Ok, shit, so I like playing blackjack, poker, and craps once in a while.
Ok, so I love eating food prepared by some of the best chefs on the planet.
Ok, so sometimes I love looking at scantily clad women without having to be in a strip club.
Ok, so during the winter I love leaving the strip in shorts and a t-shirt, traveling 45 minutes away, and boarding down Mt Charleston
Oh, and just in case you ever decide to go to Disneyland, look out.  Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy reside there.  Just in case you can't stand them and didn't realize they'd be there.
aloha~!",5
Local Flavor,"Things I love about Las Vegas:
  My hair dries in record time
  You can drink all day long
  No one looks a you strangely if you dress up
  So much to see and do
  You can sit by the pool anytime of year

Things I hate about Las Vegas:
  Immune system is shot after three days
  Can only stay here for about 72 hours before you go insane from slot music
  Taxis are outrageously expensive
  People walk slower than normal
  Buffet desserts aren't nearly as good as the buffet entrees",4
Local Flavor,"haha, you all know the line: whatever happens here...",5
Local Flavor,"From the slot machines upon arrival at the airport to the larger than life variety buffets, everything is just over the top. I guess everyone has to visit at least once in their lifetime and you'll be amazed or totally disgusted? :)

The hotel setup that mimics everything, you can have a little piece of Italy, France, New York, Egypt, pirates, classy to ghetto fabulous, you name it, you can and will have it. Btw, Elvis, Marilyn, everyone is in Vegas! 

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas + Ka-ching $$$$ !",4
Local Flavor,"I only started going to Vegas within the past year and a half, and within that time frame I have been over 10 times.  Its probably just a phase, but I am addicted!

Us Westcoasters have an advantage- a trip to Vegas is much easier to pull off when you're only an hour long plane ride away.  For lots of people, that fact is the bane of their existences (not naming names).

For me- it has been both the bane of my existence as well as the experiences that have made the best years of my life even better.  Vegas never ceases to amaze me- things just keep getting more and more out of control in this crazy city...Might as well enjoy it now while I'm young and have disposable income!!! I'm sure I'll be kicking myself later in life, but I sure as hell am loving it now!

Faves: BodyEnglish, Moon, Mix, Foundation Room, Nobu, Tryst, Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Love, 24hr everything, smoking inside (yea yea...i know), everything closes late, amazing food, amazing displays of entertainment (like the cryptic water show at the Wynn)...the list goes on...and on...and on...




...and on

Not so much faves:  return home sickly and with a cough after every trip, the extreme temperatures - either blazing hot outside or freezing air conditioning inside, too much temptation, always spend way to much $, lots of superficial people

All in all- I like it more than not.  Cant wait to party it up there again this coming weekend....!",5
Local Flavor,"i dont really know how to explain it, but when i was in vegas, i felt like i was living in somebody else's dream.",3
Local Flavor,"I always say that if you're going to be friends or lovers with someone don't try to change them, either be their friend or don't be their friend. I don't like how silicon feels, and I'm not into fake boobs, but I
love Las Vegas' fake tits because my girlfriends have a peculiar pride in them. Personally, I would be horrified, surgery is surgery and it hurts and it is dangerous, but I guess it's the same pride as getting a tattoo.

Everyone who gets a boob job feels that to get their money's worth, they have to show everyone they can, so this includes all their female friends.  I'll be sitting on the couch in their home and then they'll lift up their shirt and say, what do you think? Or fresh from a trip from LA, they will drag me to the bathroom and lift up their shirt. ""This is what $5000 can do!"" 

Or the best one, my psychic mentor who is 88 years old and still wears leather pants and looks like Joan Collins tells me about her doing yoga and eating split pea soup. She stirs the pot and then lifts up her shirt, ""Not bad for an 88 year old, huh?""

I have to say that fake boobs on my 88 year old psychic mentor look like a really fresh boob job on a twenty something.

Here's another thing, about facades and fakes. Vegas assumes everyone is a criminal. Whether you're a professional blackjack player with a computer strapped to your leg, or the little old lady who tries to take one of her silvers back after the dealer's hole card is shown, the cameras are on you wherever there is gambling, aka wherever there are slot machines which include the gas stations, grocery stores, shopping malls, bars, restaurants, and we're not even talking about the casinos. 

It's very weird that I have to apply hand lotion and face lotion every two minutes because there is no humidity in the air. 

And we haven't even started talking about the gambling. As an ex-card counter, I can tell you that card counting is not illegal, and it is super duper fun until you get kicked out.

I remember that when I was a dealer at the Dunes that I was ""juiced"" in and that I had to meet the GM first before anyone would send me down to the Sheriff's office to get my Sheriff's card. I'm still mad that my fingerprints are on file at the Sheriff's office. Oh well, there goes my career for the CIA.

Vegas doesn't even trust their own employees, you have to constantly show the eye in the sky that your hands are clean, 8 times a day, once every hour--talk about paranoid, and the city is so in denial about their paranoia that they offer everyone sex and booze just to make them more fuzzy, less inclined to do something clever, like stop gambling or going to strip clubs and drinking and doing lines of coke, or spending their children's college fund, or staying up 48 hours straight or getting married to the waitress from Ohio or buying that tranny prostitute for just 30 minutes, or drinking another shot of bourbon, or driving with open alcohol, or walking around with open alcohol or putting $10,000 on black, or buying crystal meth, which is the number one drug in Vegas, unlike most major cities number one drug, which is usually pot....I could go on, but now that I live in New York, I go to bed at a decent hour, and not at 5am like I used to.",5
Local Flavor,"Pros: 
- Easy to make money if you lack a college education.
- A tourist economy that permits upward mobility among lower classes via tips. Also, it has become standard decorum in Vegas to tip in industries in that are not perceived as tip-worthy elsewhere (e.g., nail salons, car washes).
- Kitschy architecture and art that is unique to Vegas. 
- Affordable houses and townhouses. 
- Less racial tension than other larger cities.
- FREE PARKING EVERYWHERE!!! Parking lots are abundant, rarely do you ever have to park on the street, and parking lots are always free. 
- Cool place if you like to gamble and party.
- A truly 24 hour city - you can do your grocery shopping, hit the gym, or go out to dinner 24/7. 
- The winters aren't warm (it's a desert, not the coast), but snow in the winter is never an issue. 
- Never humid, with a little extra conditioner you can get your hair to do whatever the hell you want it to and never have to worry about it going flat or frizzy.
- Amazing shopping (think Chanel rather than Intermix). 
- Fine dining epicenter (housed in casinos only). 

Cons: 
- The women in Vegas are vacuous, uneducated, with bad style. Frosted pink lipstick, huge fake boobs, haggard ex-druggie face, baby-T's and distressed denim, and lots of sweat. I feel like I'm in an eighties porno. 
- Incestuous social circles. 
- No locally grown food, and the stuff that is grown here isn't organic (or particularly nutritious since there is no decent soil in the valley). Consequently, the food off the strip is prepared with ingredients that are shipped in from California. These ingredients are picked before they are sufficiently ripened, treated with chemicals to artificially induce ripeness, and therein lies the reason why food in Vegas is tasteless and the flavors are so muted. 
- Limited things to do if you don't drink, gamble, or go to clubs. This means that if you are under 21, you are at home getting high and playing video games (I know I was). 
- No cultural innovation, since anyone remotely talented or creative moves somewhere else. No available jobs for creative professionals. 
- Commuter university that doesn't lend itself to the establishment of a college town culture. 
- One of the highest high school drop out rates in the nation.
- One of the least responsive media markets in the nation. You will never see a film being released here that isn't being released in at least 100 other cities. 
- Highest teen pregnancy rate in the nation, a result of the insidious but ever-present religious power complex that exists in this city, constantly wielding its power to crush anything progressive or reasonable (like planned parenthood). 
- Lesbian community rife w/ gnarly uneducated women in cowboy hats or catty pseudo-hipster college students. 
- Huge population of people with limited or no education occupying high paying professions, meaning that the people operating this city are dumb as rocks. 
- Limited mental health care facilities, which translates into having a substantial percentage of the local population self-medicated and driving drunk 24 hours a day (hence the astronomical DUI rates).
- One of the highest domestic abuse rates in the nation. Conjoin a bustling drug trade, the 24 hour availability of liquor, and underscore it all with a cultural milieu that hates women (ala conservative religious and androcentric sex trade gender politics), and you get sky high domestic abuse rates. 
- The city attracts people who can't successfully live anywhere else, whether its due to their disaffecting personality, addictive behavior, or delusional relationship with reality. 
- It's a small town masquerading as a big city. People move here because they think the valley is the Strip, when in actuality, if you're not on the Strip, you're essentially in a strip mall somewhere in Arkansas.
- Downtown gentrification projects and new high rise developments are elitist, the cost of which prohibit young, creative, and innovative people from affording them. 
- All apartments have carpeted floors. Like I really want to live on a pile of fabric that has been lived on by innumerable other people that is impossible to sanitize. 
- The men in Vegas fall into one of three categories. A) a tourist who wants to get drunk and fuck, B) local who wants to get drunk and fuck, and then go home to his unknowing wife, C) Las Vegas native with severe addiction/mommy/daddy issues.
- Inconvenient public trans, grid system city planning, no ""green"" spaces, recycling services that don't serve apartments.
- Post-segregation town; segregation was an irrefutable social scourge, but it encouraged the development of rich cultural enclaves (e.g., Little Tokyo, Little Italy, etc.). Vegas lacks these rich cultural hotspots.",2

Local Flavor,"In the puritan desert that this country is, where drinking is severely regulated, smoking is legally restricted, gambling is forbidden, and sex is taboo; Las Vegas is the oasis where you can drink, smoke, gamble and get screwed all at once.
The price of this amazing sinful combo varies with the individual and it's inversely proportional to their self-control.
Down the Las-Vegas-Strip river, flows an obscene amount of money.

On the other hand (or is it the same one?) the world capital city of hedonism, offers the greatest menu for leisure and recreation that one can imagine. Good eating (although awful food is found way more often), SPAs and all kinds of entertainment are constantly happening here.

You're good for a long weekend. But I would hate to live with you. You're an expensive bitch, and we don't look anything alike.

But then you get me slightly smashed, then I don't care what you look like.. cause you'll love me anyway.  And maybe you'll show me your celeb friends. And we'll all hang out until 7am.

Local Flavor,"love/hate relationship.

the good: food, food, food. you just have to know where and when to go. you can't come to vegas and not indulge in one of the seven sins: gluttony. the dranky dranks and yards of happiness. i learned not too long ago that it is in fact illegal to drink while walking the streets of vegas. the cops just don't care, have some sort of understanding, and have bigger things to worry about. why can't that be the case everywhere else?!?! and last but not least, the very few proud moments that i win some ""big bucks.""

the bad: waking up the next afternoon, wondering what the f happened the night before. losing a couple hundred bucks at one table, and not learning to stand up and walk away. having the casinos at stateline to fool the idiots like me that think it's my last chance to ""win big!!!""

the ugly: i hate you for taking my money time and time again. i love you for teasing me with the money i ""won"" only to lose it at my next stop. i love you for the free drinks while i'm donating to the las vegas fund. i hate you for the lack of sleep i get. i love you for the drapes that hide the sunlight. i hate you for the moments i walk into a casino around 11pm, then walk out in daylight. i love you for the endless fun.

""whatever happens in vegas, stays in vegas"" is not true when you're there with those who remember everything you don't. oh sin city, oohhh drunken moments, ohh vegas, see you again soon...",5
Local Flavor,"Las Vegas, I don't really know you. But I do want to thank you for all of those Thanksgiving and Christmas cards from all of those years. (been coming down since '73)

Doesn't matter what I may think of the town, I live here now. It's home.
And by town I mean off-strip. The far end of  ""its a 1/2 hour to get anywhere""

It is surprising what you do hear about it from people born here, or that have been here for several years. People are genuinely nice more or less, like anywhere. Markets, gas stations, even at the DMV (they try anyway). Not much walking at all, so you won't just pass by someone often.

Although there is an apologetic sense from people I've met, ""yeah it's hotter than hell"", ""people drive crazy"", ""lots of drunks"", ""lots of overweight people"", ""careful the Casino's are bad don't play"", ""this is nothing like a San Francisco or a New York"". I myself did not know there was an ambulance here built to handle 1000lbs patients in town, a local told me, and he laughed. I even had a local tell me it's a ""shithole"". 

I'm fine with that. I'm here.

There is something else but,  that will need more experience, and continue another day.

Forward HO!!

Red Rocks Canyon. Valley of Fire. Mount Charleston. Lake Mead. Sunrise Hills. Las Vegas Speedway. Lots of stuff around...
Makes me keep that Dirt Bike on my list of ""things"", got to do some exploring!

The Shows & The Strip are nice for a change from the everyday. 
And are only 1/2 hour away........but now since town has spread out so much there is actually quite a lot nearby, what ever part of town you may live. Home.........",3
Local Flavor,"Hooray for copious amounts of alcohol and air conditioning!

Boo for overcharging for everything and trying to dupe customers into paying more than they owe on bar tabs!

But I'm a sucker with a short term memory. So I'll be back for more punishment soon. And be surprised all over again.",3
Local Flavor,"Hmm..I was hesitant to give it 5 stars, but really I love coming here. My first trip here was last year and I've been back 3 times already and planning on going 2 more times this year.

It doesn't really get old to me and I enjoy the idea that I know my way around to some point, but have yet to see the entire place. Our last trip we decided to taxi everywhere (specially since I had a fractured ankle) and I decided taking a taxi is so worth it.

We went to Fremont St. NOT WORTH IT hahahaha or at least if you've never been, you can go once and be set for 10 years.

I like gambling, so that may contribute to the love of it all, even if I have the money or not. I get so use to being able to gamble and drink in public that when I come back to reality it throws me off.

I've only gone when it's super hot (and causes chafing) so I don't know what it's like during the winter.

Also, I agree, why are their so many families here that don't care that their children are exposed to great amounts of smoke, porno, and young, drunk childless people?

So far I've only stayed at the Paris, Imperial Palace, and that timeshare building. All on the strip and all within great walking distances of everything.

I like the feeling of waking up and being able to go down to the lobby/casino like I live there. HAHA

I have yet to sample any of the legal prostitution (although lawd knows I am in dire need of it) so until then, 2 stars.",2
Local Flavor,"I'd like to dedicate my 300th review to the amazing Las Vegas! Vegas is my home away from home!

I have probably been to Vegas 25+ times in my lifetime and only about 7 of those trips were after I'd turned 21. Because my Canadian uncle loves to gamble, Vegas tends to be a popular family reunion spot for our family. How many people have spent multiple Easter's in Las Vegas?!

I have stayed at the Wynn, Mirage, Planet Hollywood, Venetian, Bellagio, Desert Inn (think it might be gone now), and Imperial Palace and enjoyed them all! (though some are a lot classier than others...) Their VIP suites with chocolate covered strawberries and champagne are a great feature too!

I've also won at the craps table, lost at the craps table, won at the blackjack table, lost at the blackjack table, won on the slot machines, lost on the slot machines, layed out at multiple gorgeous pools (but never gotten burnt!), eaten too much amazing food (at Bouchon, Wynn restaurants, etc but never gotten sick), loved clubbing (at Tryst, Tao, Pure, Light, Body English, etc and often at tables...), shopped (at malls, at Caesar's Palace, and more), seen excellent shows (Zumanity, Jersey Boys, Cirque de Soleil, the Temptations, the Pointer Sisters), ridden in limos, endured strange injuries (piggy back rides can be dangerous!), and much, much more! 

I heart Vegas and am always looking for an excuse to take another trip!!!",5
Local Flavor,"You know those Vegas commercials where everything goes chaotic and the answer is to go to Vegas? Well...

I went here on vacation to relax, only to come back to San Francisco unrelaxed and still wanting a vacation. I think Las Vegas was meant for girls and their girlfriends, guys and their bro-friends, pimps and their ho-friends, and everyone else but me.

When I muster up the courage about a year or so from now, I might be able to go back to Vegas and give it at least four stars. The Bellagio watershow was more amazing in real life, the high-end shops like Louis Vuitton and Dior insult your wallet, every hotel is pretty much its own amusement park, and the buffets will make you buy bigger pants (unless you have a fast metabolism like me, ha ha).

That's just the strip. Go down to old Las Vegas on Fremont and see a whole different crowd of people: rednecks, cowboys, Denny's breakfast menu senior citizens, etc.

At the age of 22, this was my first time in Vegas and that amazes people. I don't see what all the fuss is about. Some people visit Vegas once a year if not multiple times a year, and I on the other hand can't imagine going back at least for a while.

Vegas is chaotic.",2

Local Flavor,"I gotta say... it is an odd place.

History:
Mobsters need a place to launder money, so they build crap in the desert.  Too much crap.

The crap gets cheesy.  REALLY CHEESY.

Then Steve Wynn comes into a failing mobster town... (this is a bit simplistic to say the least) and watches the town failing because the bottom line is *all of a sudden* really, really, really important... because there is no endless cash through illegal activities.  All the buffets, clubs, performances... once a silly, trite amenity are now the total business model.  And what was once becoming a disneyland town in the 90's is now sitting reinvented by Wynn as a world class place for the world to come and find the finest of everything.... 


but it isn't.  It is an awkward pain in the middle of stopped construction going through tremendous growing pains and fantastic infrastructure problems.  Hotels have a price point about 30% anything I have ever seen..... and all this because the lack of the fine old illegal funds coupled with this world class nonsense... you have one of the most ridiculously overrated, overhyped, and overpriced town in the world.

It is fun with the right people... or person.  It is a blast.  It can be naughty, it can be romantic....

but it will always be depressingly, emasculatingly expensive... smokey enough to ruin suits, and a massive show of classless troglodytes yammering at tables, begging at slot machines, and mindlessly ambling, slack jawed, dazed, lost, and totally oblivious.

I am always the latter.",2
Local Flavor,"After living here 10 years I figure I have seen enough to have something to say.

What started as a rural community with a few subdisions and of course the toursist attraction of a street full of casinos & hotels. The Strip.

Then it was NightClubs,StripClubs,MegaRessorts, and World Class Dining & Entertainment.

This place has morphed into a Metropolis with freeways criss-crossing the city and MegaResorts, Supermalls, neighborhood strip malls and neighborhood casinos suburban communities like Summerlin, Del Webb, Lone Mountain, and all the subdiviisions.

Houses were built by the 1000's overnight with imported labor. Population went from 60K to over 300K in less than 5 years.

WHat happend?

Schools are 48th in the country which is BAD.Huge class sizes, very underqualified teachers and lots of non-english speaking.40% high school drop out rate!!

Healthcare is non-existant-UMC the county hospital receycled needles spreading Hepatitis last year.Plus nurse shortages.

Courts, County Commission, Mayor and other Governemnt Offcials are corrupt as they come.-The mayor is a former mob attorney. County officials have been indicted & convicted of many crimes, Judges & lawyers arrested regularly. Its madness

Parks & Recreation is where we actually exceed expectations. Theres lots of parks and stuff to do without having to gamble.Lots of sporting events for the kids.

Jobs-Well pay is relatively low unless you are in a high tip paying job or a stripper or something illegal.
Most jobs on the Strip require a Sherrifs Card which cost you $40-$50 and requires a background check and fingerprinting at the police station.
Some jobs also require a Health Card for food handling etc, this requires you to go to the hospital and get a TB shot and watch a video some people have to get other shots too.
Then there the TAM card-Tobacco & Alcohol Managemnt-waitresses,bartenders,clerks and lots more have to get this card which requires a class & test to complete. Plus it cost you $80-#$00.

Food & Entertainment.-Well everyone knows about the Fancy Chefs and all their Fancy restaurants on the Strip but Las VEgas is filled with culinary delights. Many people relocate here and bring their own cuisine and styles.

There's tons of community events for familys and Vegas knows how to throw a party. The big Holidays are always loaded with tourists  but you kind find many intimate events throughout the year.

Lots of quality librarys and other resources.


Casinos have been allowed to build in residential neighborhoods so now nearly every neighborhood has a casino of some kind which is nice if you like $2.99 breakfast & other thinngs casinos offer.

The bus system has added the Duece to its fleet making ir a little better but its still a little slow. The monorail has been erected but not completed. It seems it would be a better beenfit going to & from the airport to the strip.

Many of the traditional casinos had been imploded & new ones bigger & brighter and more expensive have been built in their place. Condos on the strip have become a reality and even Trump has come to town.

Our XFL Football team came & went. We have lots of sporting events and concerts to attend and at reasonable prices.No real chance of ever getting a PRO sports team..

Las Vegas is hot & sunny 300 days a year and for some a little too hot but we adapt and learn to beat the heat.

We have pools in our backyards all hotels and apartments have them too. Lake Mead & Hoover Dam is just a drive to the water even though its been less than impressive over the years.

It's pricy to live in the city but you have everything you need right in the neighborhood, lots of great finds & deals around, usually plenty of jobs to go around and there's always a little luck.

You can take a vacation just by going down the strip or downtown , theres always something new & exciting. Learning to use the comp system at the casinos makes living in Vegas so much funner.

Prostituion may not be legal but there's plenty of Escorts for you and Marijuana has been decriminalized so the cops don't fuck with you plus the quality has gotten alot better with all the legal supply in California nearby.I love this place all you can eat munchies for under $10 everyday!!",4

Local Flavor,"Viva Las Vegas - and all the old cliches apply.
I love it here for 3-4 day stints about every 2-3 years.

I will never be a hard-core Vegas tourist, and I doubt if I will move here - but I enjoy visiting every few years and eating, drinking and indulging.

It's surprisingly good for families with kids - lots to do (think wave pools at the Venetian.)",5
Local Flavor,It's just about the best place you can go for anything you want at any time of the day.  I LOVE VEGAS!!!,5
Local Flavor,"Bright light city gonna set my soul
Gonna set my soul on fire 
(yeah, that's heart burn from the ridiculous buffets)

Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn,
So get those stakes up higher 
(better be ready to leave broke!)

There's a thousand pretty women waitin' out there
And they're all livin' devil may care 
($1.95/ minute some additional fees may apply)

And I'm just the devil with love to spare
Viva Las Vegas, viva Las Vegas 
(you and the millions of other Vince Vaughn wannabes)

How I wish that there were more
Than the twenty-four hours in the day
(because you'll probably be passed out for 12 of the ones you're here)

cause even if there were forty more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away
(Not that you could in this town)

Oh, there's black jack and poker and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
(Yeah, fortunes made by casinos, and lost by you)

All you needs a strong heart and a nerve of steel
Viva Las Vegas, viva Las Vegas
(All you need is a thick skull and cheap cologne)

Viva Las Vegas with you neon flashin
And your one arm bandits crashin'
All those hopes down the drain
(and handing you titty tear sheets)

Viva Las Vegas turnin day into nighttime
Turnin night into daytime
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again
(that's for damn sure, RIP Sands, Frontier, etc., etc.)

I'm gonna keep on the run (you'll have to)
I'm gonna have me some fun (no doubt)
If it costs me my very last dime (and it will)
If I wind up broke up well
I'll always remember that I had a swingin time
(this I can't deny)

I'm gonna give it everything I've got (even the shirt off your back)
Lady luck please let the dice stay hot
Let me shout a seven with every shot
Viva Las Vegas, viva Las Vegas,
Viva, viva Las Vegas

Ok, I'm being snarky, when truthfully, I love Las Vegas.  My mom grew up here and I've spent A LOT on and off the strip, so I have a special relationship with the town both as a sort of inside/outsider.

If you don't live here, Vegas is great for about 24 hours and then it is just exhausting.  If you do live here, it's a struggle (unless you roll like Steven Wynn - and I don't even think he's got it all that easy).  

But regardless - Vegas is fun and Vegas has a spirit all it's own.  Maybe it's the modern Sodom and Gomorrah, maybe it's the collective Id letting out our wild pagan spirits - but Vegas is one hell of a town - no one can deny that.  I just wish it had retained some of the class it once had instead of accumulating all of its excessive grandiosity it's drowning in now.

People who are from Vegas have a love/hate relationship with their town.  They like the quirks, but hate the tourists.  They want to leave (a lot of them) but most of them stick around.  Vegas is a place of perpetual limbo - a world caught between absurd fantasy and stark reality.

For this reason, I rate Vegas squarely in the middle as there as many reasons to love Vegas as there are to hate it.  And given that most of the time the house sets the odds against you, I'd say giving it a 50/50 is generous :)",3

What started off as a city to let loose and have a little fun has become my secondary home.

At first, Las Vegas was strictly confined to the narrow boarders of The Strip.
And can you blame me?
Blazing bright neon lights, ceaseless sounds of spinning slot machines, crazed crowds looking to party, and enough food and drink for a lifetime of total and utter debauchery.
It was HELLA FUN.

But things change when friends and family decided to live here.
Who knew there was more to Las Vegas than The Strip?
There are parks, churches, schools, libraries, grocery stores, a million strip malls . . . . you know everyday kinda stuff.  It weirded me out thinking that people could 1) live here and 2) seriously, people really do live out here.
But it's cool - now.

I still enjoy an occasional Vegas getaway when needing to chill or the 2-4 bug bites; although, I have toned things down a little.
Don't get me wrong, I'll still hit The Strip once in awhile.  I just have to temper the partying knowing that I may have an early tee time the next day.

BTW, did I ever tell you the time I almost vomited on Paris Hilton?
Sad but True story.",5
Local Flavor,"Went to Las Vegas this weekend and had a blast.  We had some good food, walked for miles looking at the flashing lights, casinos and weird architecture. The - one star is for the long line of people snapping cards in your ear..eech",4
Local Flavor,"I probably have lung cancer from all the inhaled second-hand smoke....

I probably have a failed liver from all the alcohol i consumed the three days I stayed in Vegas ...

I probably acquired an STD from the pole I had been dancing on at Club Pure...

I probably have aged 10 years in the three days in Vegas from partying/vomiting/grinding/fighting, etc.....

i probably have no more friends because I chose to act like one of the dumb bitches from the bad girls club being belligerently drunk.

BUT HEY! YOU only live once!

don't judge me",5
Local Flavor,"Vegas: 1
Me: 0

/sobs

Good Times!",5
Local Flavor,"It's not Europe, It's not Puerto Rico, it's not any of the exotic islands I've visited down in the Caribbean........but I'm still a fan.

People asked me if I liked Vegas, I told them I do.  I could never live here though.  The city is like a plastic dollhouse.  It's fake, but it's nice looking.  You want it to be real, but you know deep down what it really is.

After all that, I'm still a big fan and can't wait to go back.",5
Local Flavor,"Vegas Baby, Vegas! 

I've only been to Vegas once before but that was for a wedding and i was also in a relationship at that time. In other words - my trip sucked. However, this time was a way different! 


So many hilarious stories to tell. The 72 hour slaughter fest was freaking nuts man! 5 buddies and myself ventured off to Las Vegas to celebrate our friends birthday through the whole memorial day weekend. We stayed at the Luxor in a 2 bedroom spot in one of the luxor towers. We got slaughtered on the strip. We got slaughtered at the many casinos. We hollared at women both on and off the strip. I gambled a lot and was so drunk i was asking the blackjack dealer to ""hit me"" while i was on 19 LOL. 

We took pictures with ladies on the strip and ladies we met in the club. We managed to catch a live performance inside the Cesar's palace club ""pure"" of Method Man and Redman for their new album Release of ""BLACKOUT 2"" i believe. I managed to be the only one not dancing during the performance staring at Meth and Red like a zombie - on one because i was so blasted. In addition, i also managed to get kicked out out the club ( nonviolently ) and somehow ended up in the backstage area of Cesar's palace. Yet, with all of this happening, i somehow caught a $20 dollar limo back to the Luxor by myself. LMAO. 

Luxor's breakfast buffet was great. I really didn't eat much anywhere else. It was a lot of drinking done that whole weekend. I'll be going back soon hopefully. But this time we will be flying and not driving. That drive was brutal lol. 

As i said, many stories man. Vegas is definitely not a place for a family. There is drugs, drunk people, and working girls in and around the casinos all over the place. LOL. I highly recommend it for adults! It is in fact, an adult playground indeed! LOL 

Definitely go and get slaughtered and leave all inhibitions aside!! yeaaa!!!!!!! 

5 out of 5 because i was with all my boys!",5
Local Flavor,"Many emotions ran through me when I was in Vegas. Right when we got there we heard the news of the Pop Icon Michael Jackson passing away. We didn't let that bring our trip down. We did it big for MJ. We celebrated his life. Here's some other feelings I have about the trip.

Las Vegas
I miss you (feel so carefree when I'm there)
I hate you (why you take my money!?)
I love you(Food!, Drinks!,Dances on Laps!)

Plane ride to Vegas
I hate you (turbulence like a motherf*cker!!)
I love you (for getting me to Vegas in an hour)
I miss you (until next trip)

Vodka, Jack D., Capt. Morgan, Jager
I love you (got me buzzzzzzzzin'!!!)
I hate you ( the next morning )
I miss you ( when I'm at work )

Yelp
I love you (although I've neglected you)
I hate you (Freestyle Fridays will make a comeback soon)
I miss you ( too busy at work )

Sorry my fellow yelpers for the late review. Got right back to work once I came home. More vegas reviews to come.",5
Local Flavor,"I thought I learned my lesson the first time I came to Vegas. But I guess old habits die hard.

Once a drunk whore, always a drunk whore.

I went to Tao plastered.
I took my time in the bathroom and was confronted by a security guard. 
Mind you, by that time I already had maybe 6 swigs of captain morgan. She questions my sobriety and asks me who the president of the United States is. 
Whatever my answer, it was not Barack Obama. 
I was then kicked out.
WELL DESERVED.

Great, now vegas thinks im a STUPID drunk whore.",4
Local Flavor,"I remember the first time I was in Vegas- I was all wonder and awe.  I couldn't wait to come back.

Then my best friend got married in one of the chapels in downtown- who said Vegas weddings don't last- they just celebrated their 8th year anniversary.

It was all down hill from there- gone was my gusto fo play black jack and poker.  The buffet no longer entice with its long lines and failing quality of food to accomodate quantity.

No more avid clubbing fire to dance till you drop and only ending up with a hangover the next day.  No more minis for me or that coat of cigarette smoke.

Walking through your streets littered with proposals from your legalized entertainment--cards handed over to fathers and children- lacks the class act you tout.

Blatant commercialization without human dignity packaged in the sounds of your slot machines, worldy facades and entertainment all lost its lustre for me.    

I tried to find the goodness here- and I am left with the people who work here- some not so good, but other who went above and beyond the service required for making my visits worthwhile.  

PS - Ok I guess I am not in my 20's anymore, so I think the next time I MIGHT come back is when I'm having a mid life crisis and smoking  completely banned in the casinos.  Manny please take the fight somewhere else for now!",2
Local Flavor,"You're moving to Vegas? Are you kidding me? It's like 195 degrees there and snakes come up your toilet to get to the air conditioning... These are all things that I heard from the mouths of friends and family in Sac before making my trek here 10 months ago. Well I have seen some cool stuff met some cool people and found out that I do not melt when the temp is over 115 outside. For this I say thank you Las Vegas. Lets move on to my Review/ Letter to Las Vegas: 

Dear Las Vegas, 

Coming over the hill I saw your lights in the middle of the night and I was not sure if you would always seem that bright or if the fluorescent luster would wear off,  so far the answer is no.. You are one odd city, you have so much potential but you hide your true lights and Jackpots; The real prizes lay beyond the strip, you truly do have a cultural side to you and tons of great people with good intentions living within you. You have been good to me for the last 10 months in many different ways including 100+ oz margaritas, 52 oz footballs of beer, Art around every corner, great food, and some cool new friends.  
I do apologize MR. or Ms. Vegas for my remarks about you smelling like Ass from time to time, i am still a little puzzled as to why, but I will just hope that one day you can take care of that little issue. Some of the first few people I met after meeting you had some advice for me regarding you.. The exact quote was, "" Use Las Vegas, Don't Let Las Vegas use you."" Now I guess i should just go on and apologize for using you and for the continuous use i will have of you, please let me know if you feel i have taken things overboard at anytime.. As of now i am pretty happy here and I don't see me picking up and going anywhere anytime soon. 

The other really cool traits I think you really stand out with would be your tolerance for people. you are one of the only places that i know that will allow people to come in from out of town, drink all your beer, eat all your food, do dirty things in your rooms and always welcome them back with open doors. How do you do it? 

Also Mr. Or Ms. Vegas, can you do me one favor and let card flicking folks on the strip know 2 things from your buddy Raymond... One, Divide and conquer people... And two, if i ever see them try to hand a child a card especially when they are in a stroller and it is only about 4PM, I will proceed in beating the living crap out of the entire truck load of them regardless of the officer pulling me away... 

Thanks Vegas, 

Sincerely,
Raymond B. 

P.S.
I took away one star because im sure our relationship is not at it's peak yet!!",4
Local Flavor,"Not for everyone, but it was in the cards for me.

As a child I thought Vegas was crazy awesome. I like loud places, bustling peopl, the lights, I loved buffets since I had a small appetite but high ""food ADHD"" (I was basically ""Yelping"" to my mom since birth) and I loved Lance Burton. 

As an adult I still held on that this place was a tourist place and didn't know anyone that came here who didn't work at the casino. I was perplexed why my cousin decides to come here to live. REALLY?! WHY?! .

Well a year or two down the line, I needed a drastic change in my life. I got into a talk with my cousin about maybe living here for a bit, at least I thought for a short while to get some grounding. He's one of my best buddies and I missed him so I went- though still very doubtful about the quality of life here. 

This is ""Sin City"", a town of lights and bigger the better and everything and anything any time of the day can be had, but this is a city of the ""little found things"". Beyond these flashing lights is a culture, though small and a handful of people are devotees of the small businesses and off the beaten path activities. In some ways, I can argue that we have more of a underground culture than anywhere else as everything is on a smaller fanfare. Yes, I know I'm from LA where there's a following for everything and a variety of competitors in each niche- that's my point though...lots more people but everything is just lost in a sea. I know I miss some places now that we lack here, but I sure as hell never thought of many places as special as I do here. I love feeling like I discovered a gem among a small handful of other reviewers and friends whereas in LA, I'm number 1200 to review it- thats no gem made for me, that restaurant is the ""Burger King"" of Thai food. I was part of the drove that likes food, here I feel I am a part of something. Yelp seals that for me- people who I know are feeling ""it"" like I am and want to share that love of a place with passion. 

Most importantly; a few weeks into living here- I met Him. No, not Jesus or the music group, though if there is a God this was a godsend. I'm going to have a moment here...I met the love of my life. (cue audience- ""awww!"").

Yeah, nothing changes things for the better specially for a non believer like me. I had a dream of my life since childhood and it NEVER included a husband. I wanted the career and the car full of ""United Nations"" adopted children a la ""Jolie"". Husband? Nope. Didn't want the wedding because I didn't want the divorce or children caught in the midst; I didn't believe I was the type of person to end up with more than a ""alright"" partner and I don't go middle of the road. This is the loveliest of routes; long and relaxed, beautifully bright, full of anticipation for the surprises that are on the journey and come prepped for the road hazards and accept them as the facts of traveling . 

 I cannot help but gush and cry about old people who are still lovey as I can see that old lady being me one day. They talk about their other half and I actually feel their words echo in my heart. This might sound dumb, but I can't help feel so humble and emotional every time I try to convey what miracle this is for me like they do about theirs 50+ years later. Before, I had no connection to such things and thought they were just ""nice stories"".

Who knew this city girl would live in a *gasp* suburb?! I actually like this and finally can say ""I have a home.""  I can't remember a time when I ever said that about the many places I lived at- those were just houses/apts (felt it was mostly ""jail"" from life) and it takes much little nuances to make a home. I am calm enough to be at home, enjoying the slow life.

 I respect the idea of family, but I never felt to be a part of a strong unit until now. Even I reconnected to my mom and stepdad because of this new change in me. It's mended old,infected wounds buried deep.

I learned being part of a big crowd doesn't really make you a ""part"". Quantity comes out in the unlikeliest of places. I have had very few friends here. I had hundreds of contacts in LA that I ""hung out with""....where are they now? Are they calling now that I'm not there for the mad hook ups, giving them the freebies and their drink flowing? Nope, aside from a few real deal friends. Are the Vegas friends I made/making calling? You betcha and I don't have to be flashing anything but a smile and what's flowing is my wordage.

All the more beautiful, bustling, crowded cities I've been to could ever give me this gift of being a better, more rounded self and life. This city gave me the right elements to make a life instead of just living through it on the fast lane (which will crash eventually and already had lots of dents).  

 I know my ""review"" is long winded, but I am so, so, SO  grateful I made this choice to come and no matter the imperfections of this town, I don't want to be anywhere else but here. 

Not an exaggeration- this IS my saving grace.",5
Local Flavor,"""Oh you fancy huh! Oh you fancy huh!""

Las Vegas you so crazzzay!!! See you again soon!",5

Local Flavor,Love this city!!,5
Local Flavor,"Dear Las Vegas,

Our first encounter was nothing short of fabulous.  I won almost $85 off of a penny slot machine in NY NY.  My girlfriends and I were upgraded to the penthouse suite for absolutely no reason besides the receptionist being nice.  No one in my party lost anything, was arrested, hospitalized, got pregnant or married.  I would say overall this was a very successful trip.  It began with drunken shenanigans on our flight which landed at 9PM Friday night and ended with a terrible hangover and blisters on top of blisters on Monday afternoon.  

I'll be back, friend.  It was nice to meet you.",5
Local Flavor,"Once upon a time, they used to conduct nuclear bomb testing in the desert just north of Las Vegas, until it was banned by international treaty. It's a shame it had to stop. I mean, think of the possibilities! 10 Million douchebags gone in the blink of an eye. (Not to mention finally eliminating those indefatigable Osmonds.) Maybe we can just invite in the North Koreans to resume raining fire upon Las Vegas, since they appear to be so smitten with nuclear testing. Kim Il-Jong can take in a few cabarets, dine at the $19.99 Chinese buffet, and start blowing shit up. Perfect. 

These are just a few of the fantastic scenarios I have running through my head as I wander drunkenly down The Strip (frozen pina colada in hand) through this city of gaudy, tactless, bogus crap. 

It's been 15 years since I've been here in Las Vegas. 15 years of deliberate avoidance. I came back (with deep reservations) to run a 1/2 marathon and give it another chance. In those intervening years, Vegas has grown into the mecca of adult entertainment, almost unassailable and untouchable. But in reality, it's still just the festering head of everything that's sick with American culture. It's a paradise for bimbos and cheap thrills. Except it's no longer even cheap.... 

I have never been nickel-and-dimed so relentlessly anywhere. It's so sad to watch herds of people, mouths agape, in awe over the enormous size and excess of the casinos. Well, they've been built one nickel at a time, ad infinitum, off the backs of tourists that think Vegas is some kind of nirvana. Even the normally-respectable upscale hotel chain where I stayed has succumbed to low-blows...charging a mysterious ""$9.50 Service Fee"" not included in the quoted room rate for each night stay....like they're fucking Ticketmaster now. (We're just gonna add this to your tab, because we can. What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, right?) Apparently, common staff courtesies like ""Hello"" and ""Have a Nice Day"" are no longer free, but require a separate Service Fee. Las Vegas is just a massive battleground between tourists and local businesses, both sides constantly trying to take advantage of the other though a series of unwritten rules and tribal knowledge. How much do I need to gamble to get a free drink, etc, etc.? It's exhausting. 

Vegas is also the official home of shameless self-promotion. It starts at the airport on your way to baggage claim, with a giant, glowing Barry Manilow in a not-so-subtle messianic pose. (Well, I suppose the original Jesus was a magically entertaining Jew, too, so why not nominate Barry as the Second Coming?) There are 20-story high billboards for cross-dressers, no-name comedians, magicians. Especially obnoxious are the advertisements for someone name George Wallace, the ""New Mr. Las Vegas"", his gigantic potato-head image popping up all over town. Even after a week of staring up at his nostrils on every billboard in every direction, I have no idea who this fucking guy is. 

And there's the silly, ugly architecture of  the Strip. I saw people taking photos of the cheap-looking statues and water-fountains in front of Caesar's Palace, like they were actual Roman ruins or fine art sculpture or something. I felt dumber by the day. 

And a very special Fuck You goes out to all the celebrity chefs who have set up shop in Vegas, to exploit the visiting foodies with watered-down, overpriced restaurants. Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill was average at best, and Tom Coliccio ""can pack his knives and go"" jump off a mesa. $14 for whipped potatoes at Craft Steak? I hope Padma grinds you into a puree with the heel of her shoe, you bald little twerp. It was the most fantastically, shamelessly overpriced meal of my life. 

On a positive note, you've got those bizarre Mexican guys standing around on the streets passing out fully-illustrated business cards for hookers and escorts. I tried to make conversation with these gents: ""Can you personally vouch for her oral skills? Oh, you have your mother's eyes! Do you have a Honus Wagner rookie card?"" No luck. My wife scored big-time though, and was given a business card that just had a close-up photo of an unevenly shaved vagina. It seemed to say, ""You don't need to know what I look like. I have a vagina. That's all you need to know. Call me, baby."" 

We made several mistaken attempts to elevate Las Vegas into something classy, to have a sophisticated, entertaining evening out. We tried going to good restaurants, a few Cirque du Soliel shows, concerts. However, that approach ultimately resulted in frustration, regret, and annoyance. There are just too many damn people around and too many people trying to rip you off. We decided the best thing to do in Vegas is just treat it like what it is: a town of gamblers, drunks, and whores. Get drunk at 8 AM on cheap beer and play video poker until you're unconscious and broke. In this way, it can be kind of fun, but not fun enough to ever want to return.

Bombs away, I say.",1
Local Flavor,"For my 500th review, I thought it would be nice to review the city I've called home since '93.  We've grown up together.  I've seen it explode in the 90's, get luxurious in the early 2000's and collapse in the latter part of the 1st decade of the Millenium....now it's time to reinvent the city and start over.  Ahh...such is life, Que No?

What I HATE about Las Vegas:
- People who Hate living in Vegas and want to change it to be like the city they came from.  I wouldn't try to make Chicago, LA, NYC, or New Orleans like Vegas....so why would we try to make Vegas like any other city?  It's crazy.

One day I may have to leave this wonderful city, but for now it's where I call home.  Even if I leave, I will always come back to visit.",5
Local Flavor,"For my 300th review, I dedicate it to the fabulous city of Las Vegas.  I like to call it the Chameleon City.  

It can take the shape of a very romantic town when you are with your best lady.  Dress up for the casinos.  Dine in elegance.  Take in a show.  Cocktails at a classy bar.  Blackjack at a cozy table.

Go with the in-laws and swim, grab a dinner or two and see a concert.

Go with the kids and enjoy the M&M store, Excalibur carnival, Red Rock Lanes bowling, lazy river pools, cheap buffets and Hoover Dam.

Go with the fellas for steaks, craps, golf and strip clubs.  I do hate the immigrants handing out the sleazy business cards on the strip, though.

A great town for any demographic or budget.  Just don't try to mix them up!!",5
Local Flavor,"I've called this place home since 2003. I have gained so many memories, some good and some bad. In any case Vegas will always hit a warm spot in my soul. This is the place I met my husband. This is where I had my kids. It makes me sad to leave but I know it's what I need to do. 

The ""Strip"" has provided me mayn't countless hours of entertainment. The clubs, the fine dining, the shopping, the tourist watching... All things that I don't think I could have experienced like I have here. I mean, I'm originally from NY and you can find all that there. The difference here is that you can find it all concentrated within a couple of miles. 

This is truly the city that never sleeps. How the ""Big Apple"" got that term is beyond me but Vegas really does stay open 24 hours. You can find something to entertain you at any time of day or night.  I will miss this about Vegas. I will go to a place where restaurants close at 11pm, where last call at a bar might be at 1pm and where supermarkets aren't open 24 hours.

I will come back to visit. I look forward to see the future growth.",5
Local Flavor,"Gotta love SIN CITY.....

everytime i go there, leaving is like a break-up, sad depressed and takes a week or two to get over... 

Have vegas withdrawls everytime...

I LOVE YOU LAS VEGAS!!!!!!!!!",5
Local Flavor,"Ahhhh Las Vegas.  The city that quite literally never sleeps with it's bright lights, endless entertainment, and adventurous culinary finds.   Each time I go, I find something I missed the time before and create new and fun memories.  If you find yourself bored here, you're either under the age of 21 or there's seriously something wrong with you.

Vegas, stay classy.  Until we meet again...",5
Local Flavor,"I love Las Vegas but of late, I'm completely annoyed by the hudreds of porno-card-flicking illegal immigrants that harass everyone trying to walk on the street.  There are also thousands of these cards littered all over the place - actually making it quite slippery, as I watched 2 different people slip and fall because of them... 

Message to Vegas:  Clean up this grotesque mess. There's a place for this thing (and I have zero moral issue with it), except when it's forced in my face on every single block on the strip.",3
Local Flavor,"Sometimes, I like to slip out in the middle of the night and go to this little dive bar full of pizzazz called, ""The City of Las Vegas."" It's the type of bar where the wounded can go and feel safe.

The bar is in a relatively run down area with a terrible climate and in the middle of nowhere. But sometimes, people feel the need to escape their lives and the ""middle of nowhere"" sounds very appealing. They spruce the place up with bright lights, fake Euro style architecture, and the air conditioning is always set just right. Whenever I visit, I usually take a place at the corner of the joint, slowly sip on my drink, and take in my surroundings.

Everyone is welcome here as long as you have some money to spend. If you want to spend it on alcohol, there is plenty of it and they serve it all day and night. If you want blow it by gambling, it's here in various forms so you can play cards, roll dice, bet on sports games, or pass the time on slot machines. And if you want drop it on women, they are all around and some are real, some are fake, and most use the atmosphere full of dipsomania and debauchery as an excuse to let loose, go wild, and do things they want to do (that society frowns on). 

Remember, when it comes to place like this - whatever happens at this bar, stays at this bar. Well, except for a fertilized embryo. That sort of follows you back home.

At a table near me, I watch a group of guys with spiked hair, lined facial hair, and t-shirts that come in metallic prints and feature angel wings on the back. They continually takes shots of tequila, give each other high fives, and hug each other in a homoerotic fashion. I notice that they are confused as to why when they are in a bar full of women; yet, the only ones that will speak to them want drinks, money for a lap dance, or need them to speak to their pimp first. 

At a table right in front of me, I observe a group of young women surrounding a girl with a veil on. They are excited and I notice one girl  in the crowds that is super loud, boisterous, annoying and starving for attention constantly staring at me. Eventually, I want the uncomfortable stares to go away, so I look her right in the eye, smile, and ask how her night is going (just to be friendly). 

As the eyes are the windows to the soul, I can see how much she hates herself and tries to make up for it by acting sassy, but trying her best to fit in, and having any guy out there buy her drinks. This type of transaction is her validation and the drink is her elixir of miserable happiness. Each drink makes her think less about her eating disorder and physical insecurities. She is ashamed of her face that features small eyes, a long nose, and thin lips. She looks 25, but is going on 46. Instead of smiling back, she makes fun of my hair and goes off to find another person that will feed her the cure to her misery. She does not have any clue that she is essentially poisoning herself and her mind. Each glass full of medicine is only making her more sick.

On the opposite corner, I make slight eye contact with large, muscular guy hovering over some whiskey. He's in a tuxedo and is carrying a bag with a cop outfit. He was once a promising athlete, but he tore his ACL in college. His body betrayed him, he was never the same, lost his scholarship, and never finished school. These days, he drives a limo and strips part time at private parties. Years of steroid use caused him to lose his hair, develop slight ""bacne"" scars, and made him socially awkward with women. He hates to think of what could have been, so he avoids being alone. Right now, his one and only friend is Jack Daniel.

At one end of the bar, I look over at petite cocktail waitress to order another drink and we make eye contact. She is in her late 30s, but you can tell she was once a pretty girl. She moved to Los Angeles to become an actress, but her career never took off. In order to pay bills and support a child, she took a job as a cocktail waitress and used her looks to get by. These days, with her face aging prematurely due to heavy drinking and smoking, the tips become smaller and smaller. She resents the new young cocktail waitress and her fresh skin, pouty lips, and perky breasts. The resentment grows and she drinks to make it through her work shift. And she can't sleep unless she drinks a little at home as well.

It's usually busy at this bar. Everyone has a story. But at ""The City of Las Vegas,"" sweat has never tasted this sweet. And also, alcohol has never tasted more soothing, drugs have never been more delightful , gambling has never been more exhilarating, dancing has never been more thrilling, and sex has never been more exciting. Some people come here to temporarily escape their insanity. But most people never truly escape their insanity. It follows you around no matter what part of the bar you go to. 

In the end, the sheer ugliness of depression has never looked so beautiful.",3
Local Flavor,"My recommendations on vegas a whole:

The hot clubs right now are LAX at Luxor, XS at Encore, Vanity at Hardrock, and Pure and Tao are always good. I personally HATE Jet at the Mirage. Its small and there is no where to sit. oh ya and it turned in to gangsterville. DO NOT go there.

As for buffets my personal fave has been the Mirage buffet. The Paris one is also tasty since it has all the french pastries you can eat and also crab legs. They offered bottomless mimosas too on Sundays I think.

If you are looking for a tastie lunch spot there is a place called ""terrace point cafe"" right next the buffet at the Wynn. There are sky lights everywhere so its all open and pretty. The sliders are good and I had the cobb salad too.

One of my favorite things to do is play beer pong at O Shea's and go to Earl of Sandwich. If you have not been to the Peppermill YOU MUST GO!! Best BLT ever and the bloody marys are AMAZING. 

I also love Downtown Freemont. The drinks are 10x cheaper than the strip and you can take the bus for $4.00, but you have to have exact change.

Gambling is the same everywhere. Slots of fun is the cheapest other then downtown.",5
Local Flavor,"Not as good as it used to be.  Economy is slow.  But Vegas is Vegas.
Always a fun time.",4
Local Flavor,"I have been here about more than 7 times and loving it! Its a place to act dumb and let go of your worries. Its my second home too. The rule of ""What happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas"" still strongly applies, SO LET THE DRINKING  AND ""SIN-ing"" COMMENCE! PARTY ALL NIGHT AND DAY (;",5
Local Flavor,11 years passed between visits to Las Vegas.  Much had changed but the same vibe was still there.  It's still trashy and deviant with the facade of glitz and glam.,3
Local Flavor,"My Sweet lovers guide to vegas treats!!

Jean Phillipe patisserie is a must. They have two locations, bellagio with the famous chocolate fountain display  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=5CTu6r-oMEnATEqkMQFtYg and the one at Aria  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=zqVvDm_-ikgvhPMZrUK3Lg which is bigger and has an area to sit down and indulge. U can have a variety of cakes, gelato, chocolates, crepes, pastries.. They do not sell individual macarons but u can buy a packaged set. The crepe, mousse cake and creme brulee gelato I had were all excellent!

Max Brenner @ Caesars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=VM3v-ly8TaqF6Gi21XOCTg is chocolate lovers dream! The chocolate smell wafting alone is intoxicatingly delicious. They not only have a boutique of chocolate treats, u can eat a fabulous meal here and make sure to get a chocolate chip walnut cookie: the best I ever had! 

Check out sugar factory at PH http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pNR0cAPdO4RHulVTFssn-A?select=eFmRocS3vcKGcJNlBTibOQ if u love gummies, lollies etc. but the cupcakes, macarons, gelato looked pretty ordinary.

Bouchon bakery at the Venetian  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=U4VwyUcdlz4Mlsl3hqb5Ug is a great stop if you've never been to any of the bouchon bakeries. It's a small stand as opposed to a shop. Signature bouchons r always great, their macarons r not my fave but huge and pretty. A new fave for me is their carrot whoopie pie!

Vosges at the Forum shoppes is a cool place to check out if u like exotic flavor chocolates. But it can be  pricey.
If u like banana cream pie, the one at Emerils at MGM is awesome!

I went to Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=v2QzpbqjH_ok7MlKhQsnpw expecting awesome desserts but altho beautiful, I was not too impressed.

Didn't get to check out Payard at Caesars but they have macarons there, altho i'm sure they don't beat Paulettes (now called Lettes) in LA.  Dessert at Wynn buffet  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=IAjMHTukj1EFSbL6WILEgg was disappointing

Other highlights of vegas eats for me was Cosmopolitan pizza, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon@ MGM and Earl of Sandwich @ PH.

Shows: Jabbawockeez at Monte Carlo was super fun and very memorable!

If ur going from LA, if they r open, make sure to visit My Delight Cupcakery in Ontario on the way home. They have the best cupcakes around!!!http://www.yelp.com/biz/my-delight-cupcakery-ontario#query:my%20delight%20cupcaker

*thanks ken c & janice c.for some of the recs!",5
Local Flavor,"City of Las Vegas - you get to be my Yelp Review #900!

Many many years ago, I remember driving to Las Vegas from San Francisco via Southern California.  As we entered this city of lights and desert heat, all I could ever remember thinking was, ""I could never live in Las Vegas...it's so far from the ocean!""

Fast forward to 2006 and I started to become a regular visitor to this city that was once so foreign to me.  Before I knew it, I'm living here and starting a completely new life here with the boyfriend (the BF).  It's here in this city that the boyfriend became the Big F (the fiance), and eventually, the Husband.  

Las Vegas started to grow on me as I discovered more activities and events that kept us busy beyond the Strip life.  (And it doesn't hurt that we have our fave restaurants here - Ichiza, Hot N Juicy Crawfish, Shabu Shabu Paradise, Luv-It Custard, Poke Express, Lawry's, etc.)  

Yelp came along last year with an official community manager, which meant even more fun times and more great people to meet!  Las Vegas was getting better and better in my eyes!

But it's 2011 that the City of Las Vegas has brought on a new role for me in my life, and that is the role of ""mother"".

On January 16th, I gave birth to my adorable son (the Baby) and on his birth certificate it says he was born in the City of Las Vegas, Clark County.  

This city has now brought on a new permanence in my life.  Not only has it become my home, but the home of my family. 

And so, I can't help but love the City of Las Vegas.  It's brought on a whole new meaning in my life.",5
Local Flavor,"Traffic was terrible and it was the middle of the week.  There were crowds of intoxicated people everywhere.  It was hard to get around and casinos seemed to be separated from each other by streets lacking safe ways to cross them.  I gues I am just not turned on by large mobs of people.  Also everything was exspensive so that explains the number of people at anything ""free"".  Except a lot of the freebies were closed.  I doubt I will ever go back.",2
Local Flavor,"Outside of the strip, Vegas is a thirsty brown desert. When we were flying in, we barely saw any water. Mostly dirty, dirty sand and rocks everywhere. 

But a beautiful landscape surrounds with the striped landscape of Red Rock Canyon to the west and more mountains and canyons to the east, from where the sun rose one morning as I watched it from our hotel room. As for natural wonders and national sites, the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam are only a drive away.

And I thought Florida was hot, but it was nothing compared to the oven heat which you could never escape from unless you are indoors or in a pool somewhere. The wind is like a blow dryer and the shade was just as hot. I thought night would bring cooler weather, but it felt like daytime -- just without the sun. 

Yes, Vegas is a barren desert. Except for the Strip. Possibly the only Oasis in Vegas where water is wasted in excess and indulgence in forbidden shenanigans is the law of the land. 

The Strip itself seems like Disney World for feening adults, with those people passing out souvenir cards in front of the Miracle Mile shops, mobile ads for call girls on trucks, and free magazine stands with used people instead of used cars.

Aside from debauchery, there is plenty to see and do. The FREE sights, like Bellagio Fountains, Mirage Volcano, MGM Lions, as well as the Vegas showgirl dancers, Cirque shows, magic shows, and famous performers to see on stage. They even have the aquarium and plenty of spas if you miss being around water. 

For the adrenaline junkies, they have plenty of activities, from ziplining in the canyons or Fremont, mountain biking in the canyons along double black diamond trails, land sailing, indoor skydiving, and several coasters and thrill rides along the Strip.

Nightlife in Vegas is unmatched anywhere else. There is plenty on the Strip and even in one hotel/casino you'll find 2 or more clubs and bars. There are promoters everywhere, so there are opportunities to skip lines or get in FREE. Not to mention all the eye candy EVERYwhere. 

Also, plenty of restaurants and buffets to stuff yourself silly or overload your stomach with dessert.

A great escape from the regular day-to-day grind, but make sure you bring enough money with you. Or at least brush up on your gambling skills. You might be thirsty for more than just water.",5
Local Flavor,"Cops have a reputation for being dicks but I didn't experience any problems in January when I last went. Clean, especially downtown, fun and the food is better than San Francisco but not as good as NYC. Parking is near impossible, better to shuttle around some other way.",4
Local Flavor,"They say you leave your heart in San Francisco. Well, in Las Vegas you leave your dignity. Also, possibly your underpants.

I think you all know which one I prefer.",5
Local Flavor,"They say ""what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas""...but really now...this is Yelp and what happens in Vegas is meant to be shared ;) *winks* hehe. 

With the thought of another saying of ""sharing and caring,"" here are my thoughts about this fabulous city. 

I've always liked Las Vegas. I remember even when I was a little girl, I liked the family trips here. There was something about the hustle and bustle of people, the bright lights and playing for toys with my dad at the arcade at Circus Circus that just made me smile. 

Now that I'm older, I still like this bright city. There are so many sights to see and there is plenty of things to do for everyone. 

There are so many new casinos that are simply amazing sights. I like that these new casinos offer so much more than being gambling venues. The Cosmopolitan is my new favorite on the Strip. I love all the unique things you can see inside the Cosmopolitan. (This will be another Yelp review in itself). Aria is another cool hot spot. Both of these new casinos were built with a cool architecture design and are quite sights to see. 

It's not all about casinos in Vegas, if you're into outdoor activities, than Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area is a must visit. Large red rock formations of all shapes. In certain areas one can go hiking, biking, rock climbing, horseback riding and camping. Going here in June/July can be brutal though (It is super hot - although a weird thing did happen on one July day where it was hot one minute and then it started puring rain the next minute- true story!) 

Close to the Red Rock Canyon, is the Red Rock Country club. Beautiful houses and a golf course. It's one classy place. 

If one gets tired from all the sightseeing, have no fear of going hungry. Vegas has food spots at every corner. Buffets, steakhouses, candy, gelato and frozen yogurt stores...you name it. The world's only 80s theme yogurt store (I Love Yogurt) is located in Vegas (another Yelp review for this). If you like chocolate than there's the Ethel M Chocolate factory, the Rocky Mountain Chocolate factory and M&M word. 

Lastly, one of my favorite things to do at Vegas is shopping. There's the Miracle Mile shop, the Fashion Show Mall, the Forum shops, Las Vegas Premium Outlets, Boca Park and many more places to shop. 

Yay Vegas! Something for everyone! Woohoo! Many Vegas Yelp reviews coming soon :).",4
Local Flavor,"It's been awhile, but you always do me right.",4
Local Flavor,We Love Las Vegas!,5
Local Flavor,Still like to travel here but Vegas is not like it use to be back about 10 to 15 years about.,5
Local Flavor,"Home away from home!
Love Vegas!",5
Local Flavor,its vegas baby!!!,4
Local Flavor,"ONLY reason I give 2 stars is for the fact that my clubbing experiences came from Hollywood. Everything in that city is based on status. I find LA to be more open and different. 

Great for clubbing, shopping, restaurants and site seeing. Something you can't really get anywhere else are the shows and pool parties.",2
Local Flavor,"I don't know who sang it first, but Vegas reminds me of that Celine Dion and Pavarotti song: ""I Hate You Then I Love You"". 

In 2008, I reached a point in my life where after 6 years of visiting annually - I had to stop.  I know there are lots of people that go maybe every 3 months or so, but I got sick of it and wanted to see other cities.

So I took 2 years off and recently came back ~ there were some changes, new hotels and all that...but the only good thing about this recent trip was seeing it through my BF's eyes.  It was his first time there since he was in elementary or middle school, so he had to do all the touristy things and I kind of enjoyed doing it all over again, but I don't gamble a lot and I couldn't shop knowing that the sales tax is like 6 or 7%!!

Vegas is fun, but not like when I was younger...now days, I'd rather watch a show, have a fabulous meal, and lounge at a nice bar - not party my ass off like there was no tomorrow!  I think Vegas is the only destination a whole bunch of your friends can all agree on when planning a group vacation...which is fine by me.  Just don't expect me to stay up late every night!!",3
Local Flavor,"Good Tymes, Good Tymes",5
Local Flavor,"we had a nice time in your city UNTIL SUNDAY EVENING.  
WHO in their WRONG MIND decided that it was good idea to close the Las Vegas strip for over 6 hours this past Sunday, December 4, 2011?  The rodeo finals were in town, the cowboy christmas, the michael jackson cirque immortal tour was openning, there was a big fight and so on and so on....the city was packed! 
Your city will be really lucky if nobody missed their shows, dinner reservations and flights out on Sunday afternoon.  It took us 2 hours by tram and monorail to get to the Mandalay Bay.  With a lot of walking too....in HIGH HEELS as I thought we were taking a Cab.  But, alas the cabs never left the driveway.  Persons heading to the airport were told it would take upwards of 3 hours to get to the airport.  I imagine a lot of people were missing flights.  People were walking in the middle of the marathon and blocking the races.  The marathon ended at the back entrance to the Mandalay Bay at the same exact time that the Michael Jackson show let out.  Thankfully chaos did not insue, because we would have been lucky to live though that.  The place was crowded to the point that children who are claustrophic were crying near us.  And, I don't know about the racers.  I imagine they were pretty tired.  Hope nobody collapsed becauser THERE WAS NO WAY IN or OUT.  We were stuck.  It took almost an hour to get out of the Mandalay Bay hotel.  There is no reason for this to have happened.  There are plenty of streets in Las Vegas to hold the Marathon on that would not have caused this much insanity.  Wow...urban planning dept and police and special events should be trained or fired.  This was atrocious.",1
Local Flavor,"Slightly over rated and expensive!!! But it's still a lot of fun as long as you don't go broke gambling the night away. Good to visit at least once or maybe twice in your lifetime.

And I don't know why people want to bring their kids here...sleaziness all over the strip!

Don't bring the babieeezzzz!!!!!!!!!!!",4
Local Flavor,"Oh Vegas, how I love/hate you. After living here for 2 years and leaving I am still confused on our relationship. I will say that I love the low cost of living, the strip, and great food..
I will not miss the overall shadiness, the sketchy dirty areas off strip, the cookie cutter housing and the way locals are not given a break on the strip.",3
Local Flavor,"Oh Vegas...how I love my playground. This is MY happiest place on earth. My first time was at the tender age of 16 and it was love at first sight. The hotels seemed so huge and all the lights were so captivating. The high energy, the fast pace, the constant ringing of the slots...it was a feeling of nostalgia. Who knew then how in love I would still be at 29. This is the longest relationship I've ever had with a city besides Los Angeles, and I plan to stay true until death do us part. I remember turning 21 and telling everyone I was going to move to Vegas for a year...well that never happened and I'm sure my liver thanks me. I've spent as little as less than 24 hours in Vegas to 8 days and I must say that the perfect amount of time for me is 2-4 days. My body starts to shut down after a while.

They honeymoon period is definitely over, I don't get the butterflies as I drive in to Vegas and see all the hotels and lights, however, we're more like an old married couple...I appreciate sin city for all that it offers and every new adventure reminds me why I love this city so much. The memories that are created are irreplaceable and  I make sure to take lots of pictures! What happens in Vegas stays...in my camera ;)

Now, I know there is something for everyone but I'm not a fan of kids in Vegas, however, if they stick to staying at Circus Circus then I guess that's okay...you won't find me there. I've stayed at a lot of different hotels from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high and I've learned that I don't spend much time in my room as it is so a hotel that meets my needs somewhere in between is fine by me. It all depends on the occasion and the people you travel with. i personally like to stay smack in the middle of the strip...excitement is all around you and there's no choice but to soak it all up and hang on. 

My favorite things to do in Vegas:

1. CLUBS...I've been to MANY and there is no reason to pay to get in or wait in a line...I've paid my dues...it's all VIP all the way now. Currently I like Rain, Moon, Tryst, XS, Bank, Cathouse, and Drais (after hours until 8am),

2. BUFFETS...A good champagne brunch to help with the hangover the next morning ;) I love the buffet at the Wynn...expensive but worth it. Rio has a good one as well that's less pricey.

3. DRINK: Gotta hit up Fat Tuesday and get a yard and sip on it while you walk the strip. Drinks at a club are expensive...let me repeat...EXPENSIVE but hit up a liquor store and do some pre-gaming before you start your night, your wallet will appreciate it and you can walk the strip and into any hotel with drinks so no need to disguise your ""water"" bottle.

4. GAMBLING...I'm not big on throwing away my money but sometimes I enjoy sitting at the penny slots and enjoying the free cocktails. My favorite machine is the Gold Fish slot...I can play for hours with a $20.

5. SHOWS...Pussycat Doll show is entertaining and sexy, V variety show is fun...there's pretty much a show for everyone.

6. SHOPPING...I love to shop in Vegas because the tax is lower than where I'm from so usually I hit up Cesars Palace before I leave.

7. FREEMONT...It's not on the strip but I enjoy Freemont for cheaper drinks, the light show, and fried twinkies and oreos. The type of people you find here are different than the ones on the strip...I'll just leave it at that. 

If you're a first timer...you must walk the entire strip, enjoy the great buffets, and hit up the casinos. If you're young...go to the clubs, if that's not your thing then catch some good shows and just enjoy the beauty of this city. Always under construction (new hotels), never sleeps, and so much fun!!!! :D",5
Local Flavor,"I've been doing a lot of searches on Vegas lately because of the Yelp Spring Break Las Vegas that's coming up in 2 months!!  I CAN NOT WAIT!!!  I'm totally ready!!  I wanna go NNNNOOOWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!

Anyway, that's how I got to thinking, I should review one of my fave places!!

I've been going to Vegas since I can remember.  We used to play at the arcades while the parentals would gamble away our college funds.  We would have annual summer treks out to the desert with a huge group of friends and family.  It was good times.  Circus Circus was the place to be!!

During the teenage years, Vegas was boring...  Nothing to do except eat or stay in the room.  I didn't go to Vegas for years...

Once I turned 21, I've been coming all the time!  At least twice a year.  I remember a time when I was here for 3 weekends out of 4!  That was just craziness.

I've been to Vegas for shows, weddings, bachelorette parties, birthday parties, girls weekends, just cuz trips, you name it!  There is so much to do, so much to celebrate!

I'm not a huge gambler or clubber, but I always find something entertaining to do.

Wanna relax and unwind?  There are spas at almost every hotel!  THEbathhouse (THEhotel) and Qua (Cesar's) are must dos!

Wanna people watch?  Anywhere you find a chair works!!  People from all over the globe come to Vegas.  It's awesome!  I especially like walking the Strip on nice days.

Wanna eat?  There are soooo many restaurants and food places, one can never eat them all!  I still have a list of my must eats. 

Wanna eat lots?  Have you heard of Buffet of Buffets?  Yelp it!  I love buffets, so much variety, not enough stomach space!  :(  I like to sometimes go to off-strip places.  There are so many awesome finds!  

Wanna shop?  There are stores everywhere!!  Some of my favorite shopping is at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets North off Charleston.  & Coke World Rocks!

Wanna see cool canyons?  Red Rock Canyon is only about 20 minutes drive from the strip.  It's gorgeous!

Wanna sleep? There is no sleeping in VEGAS!!!!!!!!!!  Okay, if you must...  There are so many hotels at so many price ranges.  But...  go BIG or GO HOME!!  :P

Wanna see cute boys strut their stuff?  There's lots of that goin' on here too!!  Chippendales or Thunder from Down Under are awesome!!  Or head over to Olympic Gardens ;) for up close action!

For girlie stuff:  head to pole dancing classes or spas or Chippendales!!!

Wanna dance the night away?  There are lots of clubs, too many to count...  I don't go anymore cuz it makes me feel old :(

Wanna soak up the sun?  Most hotels have some pretty awesome pools.  I love the one at Bellagio!  Just gorgeous!

Wanna gamble?  Of course you do!!  ITS VEGAS!!!  Most casinos are pretty cool.  I like the non-smoking ones.  Grab a chair & play!  My faves are Pai Gow Poker or Blackjack.  Wizard of Oz slots is cool too!

Wanna drink?  So many bars to hang out in!!  Hit up Voodoo Lounge, it has a great view!!!

Like free stuff?  Go to Bellagio for the fountains and my fave, the conservatory/gardens.  Tons of free stuff to do!  

Oh, Vegas, how I love thee....",5
Local Flavor,"Angie W's review cracked me up! 
Circus Circus is indeed the place to be when your a kid in Vegas. 
If my parents took me to Vegas and we DIDNT stay in CC I would throw a fit.
And yes, during the teenage years this place sucks. There is nothing to do except maybe play the slots with some of your parents coins and maybe getting away with it. 

Vegas is where you go to: 
Get away from it all. Get away from your office, wife, parents, civilized civilization. 
In my opinion, this is the most interesting city in the world. I think its an academic psychologist playground! 

But anyways, I love this place. 
The pools, food, people, hotels, spas. You can find anything here, literally. 
I'm not a big gambling or clubbing fan, and although those are the two main things about vegas, the beauty is that there are so many different things to do in this awesome/terrible town.",5
Local Flavor,"were else can you get booze at any time of day and almost get hit by a drunk driver while crossing the road.  Thats right only here is the City of Sin where anything and everything can happen within a 24 hour period.  

Live it up.... Party really Hard...But make sure to make it back to work...",5
Local Flavor,The gaming capital of the U.S.A. Las Vegas is just a Fun and awesome place to visit! We had a blast we will def come back! If you dont like gambling there is so much other things to do. im in love with the city but not that Sun and weather......,5
Local Flavor,"Traveling to Sin City with Kids

I just couldn't do it.  I couldn't leave my baby, who is actually a toddler, while I traveled an ocean away from him.  Then I felt guilty leaving my oldest, so of course he had to come along for the trip.  I actually intended to travel to Vegas to be an anniversary slash Yelp celebration. But in the end, it turned out to be a family vacation.  

Here a few tips if you plan to travel with your kids to a city known for adults. 
1.  Magazines
If you have a friend or family member that lives in Vegas, ask them if they could gather those Free magazines that they have everywhere.  There are tons of coupons, free shows, buy 1 get 1 free, and it let's you know what's happening during your stay, so you can plan ahead.  I also picked up the same magazine when I got to Vegas, so I can use some of the pages for my scrap book.  
  
2.  Sign up for the Casino Cards
I don't gamble much, but I am a bargain hunter. If you sign up, the hotel/casino usually gives you something for free, a booklet of coupons, and coupons to free shows.  If you do gamble this helps you get comps to shows, restaurants, and other shindigs.  Bring a key holder that can link up to your pants, so you remember to insert that bad boy into the machines, that your gamboling your child's college fund away.

3.  Sacrifice & Compromise
Remember you are traveling with kids to an adults playground.  They do not allow you to stand close to any slot machine or gambling area.  They allow you to walk through the casino with children, but don't allow you to stand near it.   Some hotels did not let us step foot in it with a child in hand (Mermaids and Bellagio--unless your a registered guest).  Others did not allow strollers into the hotels (Encore and Wynn).  A lot of the (paid) shows do not allow children, so call ahead to make sure what the minimum age requirement is.

Since I'm not much of a gambler, I let my husband loose when my children went to bed.  

4  Apply. Reapply. and apply again.  
SUNSCREEN, 100 SPF, bring a face stick, a travel size, a kid spray, etc.  Just be stocked with it.  I'm from Hawaii, so I should be use to this.  But the dessert heat is in no comparison to the tropical rays and breeze of Hawaii.  Though we were not in the sun for that long.  My youngest left with rosy cheeks and my dad returned with a heat rash.  

5.  Internet 
There were dozens of sites that I read to help plan our vacation with kids.  
Here are a few sites that helped me:

This list where to eat, paid shows and free shows that are great for kids, and facilities where they have childcare.

6.  Las Vegas Power Pass
 ----------Awesome Value
You pay one set price to enjoy all sorts of attractions all over Nevada.  It's a different price depending on the days you want to utilize the card.  You can purchase 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, or 5 days.  I purchased the 3 day pass.  If you really enjoyed the attraction you can see it the next day again.  You have to pick up your pass from the Planet Hollywood Restaurant in Caesars Palace and the pass also gives you $10 credit towards food or merchandise.  One of the catches with the pass is you have to use the pass consecutively.  Once you activate it your 1st  day begins.  Here is the website where you can purchase the pass & more information:

7.  Hydrate & Diapers 
My youngest drank and drank and drank and leaked and leaked and leaked. Changing tables in bathrooms are non-existent on the strip. I only seen one changing table at a hotel and that was at the Paris hotel. For me, it was easier to change my toddler when he was standing up.  So I suggest practicing this at home. 

8.  Rent some wheels
You definetly need a car to enjoy the kiddie activities that this city has to offer.  We did walk a few times from hotel to hotel but risked fainting from heat exhaustion.  


Overall, my family enjoyed our trip to sin city. We did venture off the strip and enjoyed other family activities.  I'm sure since we have family in Vegas we will come again with my family.",4
Local Flavor,"Woohoo! Vegas, baby!

Say what you will about Las Vegas (or not say if you're following the Vegas code of silence), but Vegas has always been fun for me. For anyone who does not gamble (that would be me), Vegas has but 1 raison d'être: fun tourist destination.

& Vegas pulls it off. I always have a blast without ever putting a single chip into play at any casino. Even minus the gambling, there's always more fun to be had here than I have the time to get around to.

Paradoxically, my own key to keeping Vegas fun in the presence of so much glorious excess has been moderation. I don't go to Vegas too often & I don't get too stupid crazy when I'm there. I stay out of jail. I don't get tattoos I'll regret. I don't get married. I don't wake up in places I never would've fallen asleep at sober.

So even without gambling & without all the ""Hangover"" scenarios, Vegas is still fun. That's pretty cool. It's Vegas, baby & I'm a fan.",4
Local Flavor,"I love Vegas, atmosphere is cool, hotels look awesome at night, great place to go with a group to drink gamble and have fun. Pools everywhere which is nice and tons of great restaurants. I come here 3-4 ti es a year and have fun each time. As I sit here and write this review I am now wanting to go back to Vegas already even though I was already there last month.",5
Local Flavor,"Vegas baby, Vegas! We meet again. Oh how I love thee you dirty bitch!

This pretty much sums it up every time I step off that airplane at McCarran Airport. For a few days or a week you can live like a rock star and party like a porn star. It's an adult playground and fantasy land like none other. You can live out the seven deadly sins while here, and sometimes invent a few new ones!

Now don't get me wrong. I'm not some dumb tourist that is blind to what Vegas really is like in it's underbelly. Over the past 20 years I have been there many times for work and play. You go a few blocks off the strip and it's kind of sketchy. Lots of homeless and crime. On the strip it's touristy and annoying to many. Overpriced high end clothes shops and dining. Cheesy. People who live here have a love/hate relationship with Vegas. Personally, I don't give a damn about any of this. The haters can hate. Coming from NYC we have enough of our own problems too. I go to Vegas to escape. I come here to play, and to play hard. 

Terrific shows that are always in abundance, and with discounted tickets that can be found for most. Excellent dining choices from high end restaurants to low end fast food. Amazing hotels that offer all types of amenities. The gambling options are everywhere on the strip and off in the locals joints. Monster sized casinos. Conventions for everything come here. Nightlife is unequaled with some of the best dance clubs and lounges. Booze is accessible everywhere, and you can drink on the strip! Gorgeous girls at some of the hottest strip clubs around. Rocking concerts. Free sights to see on the strip. Freemont Street light show in old -Vegas. Much to do and see off the strip - Red Rock Canyon, Hoover Dam not too far, Lake Mead, Shelby Car Museum and race track, sky diving, helicopter tours, gun ranges, and so much more.

If you enjoy blazing hot sunny weather this is the place for you. Summer season is brutal, but it also has a terrific winter weather season and is a great place to go during that time of year. The pools at some of the casinos are amazing, and beautiful so make sure to pack your swim wear. Oh yeah, the Hard Rock pool party is a human petri-dish.

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. It's so appropriate, and words to live by!",4
Local Flavor,"It took me a while, but my pessimistic heart loves this flat expanse of dust, flickering lights, and strip malls. Las Vegas is the true symbol of trash, gluttony, camp, love, and sin. We do have a soul that exists outside the infamous strip. If Liberace, David Rakoff, Tammy Faye Baker, and Kim Jong il had a foursome and a baby, Las Vegas would be it. 

Things I Love:

- We are a 24-hour city. Nowhere else can you get a 64 oz margarita, a lap dance, see a circus show, get married via drive-thru and eat four star dinner within a two mile radius.
- DW Bistro. My favorite restaurant. It's delcious, chic, and beautiful. They serve the unlikely pair of New Mexican and Jamaican food, and do it very well.  
- Great shopping. I'm still surprised we snagged Topshop and Topman before LA.
- Abundant parking everywhere! I haven't mastered the art of parallel parking and I don't care because it's not needed here.  
- Downtown Las Vegas. It's growing reputation as the anti-strip is leading to excellent local bars, lounges, food markets, the Smith Center, and a growing art scene. Hipsters, fedoras, bikes, skinny jeans bothering you? Get over it. 
- UNLV's History and Sociology Department.
- Clark County Library District and UNLV's Lied Library. A literary oasis and refuge for book lovers, students, and nerds in this city. The Windmill Library is gorge, by the way.
- Despite a few insufferable summer scorchers, weather most of the year is amazing.
- 21+ out-of-town friends LOVE coming to Las Vegas. 
- Staycations are amazing. Can't afford to travel outside of Vegas? On a budget? Stay at one of the mega resorts in the valley and experience luxury without paying top dollar. 
- Chinatown. No culture? No local restaurants? Drive down Spring Mountain Road and start salivating. I can say with confidence, we have covered all the Asian countries in terms of cuisine. Korean bbq, ramen, lumpia, sea urchin, pho, dumplings, tea, boba? Check. Well, if you want Indian, there's plenty East of the Strip. Just be careful of all the bad drivers. 
- The Las Vegas Health District offers free STD, and HIV/AIDS testing. 
- 90% of the people I meet here are from out of town. Which means you meet a diverse group of people from all over the country. Most people I've met are from the east and midwest. Not surprising. 
- The rest of Nevada hates us. We are the liberal (not really/kinda/sorta), hipper, ""weird"" people of this state. We bring flavor, style, and sass to this state. We strike a pose. We hold the power, bring in the money, and the reason people know Nevada.

Things I Hate:

- The produce isn't the best. Can I just get a good tomato and raspberry please? 
- Construction everywhere.
- We tend to demolish and rebuild things. This leads to lack of historical buildings and appreciation in the city. 
- We are a desert island. The nearest metros are LA and San Diego.
- Las Vegas public education. We are always in the bottom of statiscal list reflecting mathematics, reading comprehension, and science. And we have a high drop-out rate.
- Commuting to and from school and work can be tiring.
- UNLV lacks community and college town vibe.
- No major waterpark for the locals. 
- Air quality can be shitty because of dust and smog.
- The Spaghetti Bowl
- No real gay neighborhood like the Castro, WeHo, Boystown, or even Hillcrest. 
- A two mile drive can feel like a 100 mile drive during the summer. 
- Lack of good public transportation that can be accessed throughout the entire valley. 
- The 15 during morning and afternoon rush hour.",4
Local Flavor,"Vegas is what it is. You know exactly what you're going to get when you go. I just wish there was a way to take care of the sea of people who always like to stop and just do nothing and block entrances, bridges, and stairs. Is it that hard to move to the side to let traffic go by?",3
Local Flavor,"Las Vegas is indeed a place that is worth experiencing. Is it a place I would want to live? No. Since I first went to Las Vegas in the early 90's I have seen this town which seemed rough around it's glamorous edges turn into a decent sized city. But with the delight of growing also comes growing pains. 
Personally I think traffic in Las Vegas is God awful. Not only are the roads seem ill maintained and in need of being expanded but the way people drive is nothing short of inconsiderate or even cautious. Perhaps it is resident's of Las Vegas and Nevada that feel like they need to drive this way to deal with incompetent tourist drivers. Whatever the case may be I can leave it. Denver drivers don't drive like this! 
Eating out I found out can be a gamble too. Some places that charge an arm an a leg only put out sub par casino food. The Strip is especially guilty of this. I did find that if you do wonder off The Strip not too far then you can find some good places. Just avoid the places that will bring in tourists. Of course there are always exceptions to the rule.
As Vegas has grown it has brought in many more people for at one time had a booming casino and recreation scene which made the city so big practically overnight! When the economy tanked so did the casinos and now Nevada's unemployment is worse than Michigan's!
Of course there are pros to Vegas the amazing concerts, night shows and acts that they rake in. Shopping is no slouch either! Stores that are not seen unless you live on either coast seem common place here and are an exciting treat to us Midwesterners. Those pros in of itself earns Vegas it's four stars out me. The cons are worth it if you don't get into an accident or anything of the sort.
Vegas's glitz and glam is infectious but it wears off fast. It is like having Halloween or Christmas decorations up too long. The glitz wears a bit thin and then wears you out. The hotels are themed of places that are somewhere else and eventually become transparent after being bowled over by the showiness at first glance. Of course this is all from my own point of view and some people don't mind it all and want daily doses of glitz for the rest of their lives. More power to them! Not me, it isn't a good fit for me but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy visiting after my injection of glitz and glam  from the previous visit wears off.",4
Local Flavor,"Review # 500. Wow. When it came time to choose what to review for #500, I felt it was time to give some recognition to the city that has transformed my life, Las Vegas. On a cold, snowy night in the front range of the Colorado Rockies high above Denver things were bleak and we were miserable. And my wife and I decided we had had enough. Christmas morning we opened presents, then packed them into the back of a Penske truck and up and over the mountains we went. After 2 days of driving through a snowpocalypse we topped the hill right around sunset and there she was...Fabulous Las Vegas in all her brightly lit glory. She was...and quite frankly still is a sight to behold, especially at night. 

My stay here has had some low points. As we didn't know the city that well, we first stayed in a drug infested extended stay hotel on Boulder Highway with a meth dealer on one side, a spice dealer on the other, and Metro knocking on the wrong door at 2 am was not the way one wants to meet the city's finest with badges. We had a guy who runs a local gay bar and was dating my sister in law call Child Protective Services on her entire family including us, all as retaliation against her despite the fact he beat the heck out of her and was trying to divert attention from that. Thanks Russ, we passed our drug tests and came out clean, thank you very much for the free State of Nevada funded lab work you jackass. And we got to work for a local contractor, Robert Half Technology that was the worst company my wife and I ever worked for. When we lost our jobs a week apart we almost lost our ass but we were absolutely thrilled to be free of Robert Half. 

But while there's been some bad, the good beats it 10,000 to 1. I've met some of the most talented, creative, and downright inspiring people here. Thanks to Yelp and the wonderful Misti Y. who helped me get started Yelping again after a break, I turned Yelp into my exploration tool to discover Vegas. I've learned a lot about Thai food, had my first tapas, and even learned that Ramen is not the .19 cent per cellophane wrapped package stuff, it's a hand made wonderful thing to indulge yourself with and Vegas has a couple of great Ramen places. I enjoyed exploring the Strip and all that it has to offer, found JP's awesome chocolates, and things like Kiehl's which changed my life. And then there's Fremont Street...where almost every time I step foot on it ...as Loverboy sang during a free concert down there I'm ""Lovin every minute of it!"". And I ended up at Fremont during Pride weekend by accident and it was over the top incredible. 

Step away from the lights and you have some of the sweetest single track mountain bike trails imaginable, Lake Mead and the spectacular Hoover Dam and that mind blowing bridge are essentially in my back yard. I love the views of Mt. Charleston and Valley of Fire. I've watched the Nascar Sprint Cup race from LVMS, I've been caught in a thunderstorm twice on Lake Mead and while scared like never before we made it through. And I even managed to get into the Global Gaming Expo and play slot machines that the public hasn't even seen yet...and I got to go to CES, which if you love electronics was like the most over the top experience imaginable. Vegas...she's been good to me. I'm glad to be here. And thank you to everyone here on Yelp who has followed me, gave me tips and advice, and helped me to truly make this city my new home. While Kansas City is my hometown, Vegas is a great place to be...and I admit I love being here.",5
Local Flavor,"Prior to 2011 all I knew of Vegas was from what the rest of the world sees on television and or movies;  The glitz; the glam and thanks to CSI the never ending string of psychopaths.  Being in the Criminal Justice field I never missed an episode and when my friends said hey let's take a trip to Vegas I couldn't say no. 
After my third straight day with no sleep and my body still not ready to stop as there was still so much I hadn't seen, I decided I was going to be living here within a year.  My friends laughed and said I was crazy, and that I was dreaming.  One even said this city would eat me up and spit me out a withered husk.  It took me two years to get here but I've never once regretted the decision to move to this wonderful city. 

Well I'm 22 months into my move to Vegas and I'm still going strong (see my Yelp profile and all the cool spots I've been) I signed up for Yelp a month or two into my stay here in Vegas and I've used it to find great shows, great restaurants and show off to my friends and co-workers about how easily I've adapted to this city.  That was a common thing to hear them say when I'd tell them about a cool show and or hot spot I patronized. 

I've been to events at the top of the social scale and to the depths of hell in Vegas and while both have their moments and are fun for those involved it's funny to me how easy it is to flow into both worlds and be welcomed by open arms by both groups.  

I've slowed down a little going into my 2nd year here but I still don't think I've seen but maybe a quarter of what this city has to offer locals and less than that for tourists.  I'm still learning the outdoor trails and parks and who would have ever thought you could watch Hockey in the desert and have so much fun? The 51s are a great team/park and venue and I was a season ticket holder for the first time this year. Can't wait to see the Loco's next. 

If you can put up with a few months of OMG hot heat this rest of the year is a fairly pleasant outdoor adventure and get this you won't have to shovel snow coming from the Midwest that was the a big deal for me and out of respect and fear of needing it one day I still have an ice scrapper in my trunk and get teased about it mercilessly by everyone who sees it.",5
Local Flavor,"There are a lot of buildings and lights here. Lots of people too.  Being as I am from L.A. and work in Hollywood, I don't like to do the whole Tourist thing as I see them all the time, and don't want to be or do the same.

I know some people get a excited about going to Vegas, but sadly I'm not one.  I'm not into the Whole clubbing scene, I don't go to bars much, I suck at Gambling so already I'm a fish out of water.  The shows there are cool though, even though we never got much time to go to any on this trip and whenever you are Hungry, there is always a Buffet around the corner.  

Sorry Vegas, but what happened here not only stayed here.  It also stayed back in a L.A.  Can't say I'm a fan, but as I was here with my girlfriend I did the most out the trip and did leave the weekend having a good time and with pleasant memories with her here.",3
Local Flavor,"Las Vegas is just like any other city in the continental US and is mostly famous for it's huge and glitzy resorts. I remember as far back staying in the Dunes, Sahara, and Sands before resorts like The Mirage started the building boom. My earliest memory of Vegas was back in 1989 when I was sitting outside the Sands with my mom and watched The Mirage just open it's doors to the public. 

I miss the old shows like:

Siegfried and Roy - The Mirage
Folies Begere - Tropicana
Enter The Night - Stardust
Radio City Rockettes - Flamingo Hilton
Mama Mia - Mandalay Bay (Recently Closed)

Different eras of Vegas:

Classic Vegas = Bugsy featuring Warren Beatty

Old Vegas = Clark Griswalds Vegas Vacation

New Vegas = The Hangover



Now they have shows like Peepshow, Cris Angel (Both just laughable) and Cirque shows that represent a new trend of entertainment and the occasional concert venues. 

What I also like about Vegas is the weather, the openness of the desert compared to California, friendly locals and NO INCOME TAX! The corruption in the casinos have some incentives towards Las Vegasans! :P",5
Local Flavor,"Oh, Las Vegas. You're really kind of just a sh*thole where people get fleeced in the middle of some gorgeous desert. Ironically, I've been calling it ""Las Vagueness"" for as long as I can remember, and even more ironically, even though it wasn't the original intention (it was just a play on the phonetics of ""Vegas""), the name is becoming appropriate. The more time goes on, the more vague the place becomes. This wasn't my first foray. I've been to Las Vegas probably fifteen times by now over the course of, well, decades. I was there before even one of those big stinkin' hotels were there.

Let me start out by saying, it wasn't my choice to go to Vegas. I was there for a trade show. I haven't been there by choice since 1995, then it was only for two days, watch the freaks, play a little blackjack and then leave. The show I went to is there every two years, so I'm seeing a snapshot over that period. This was the third time I was in Vegas for the show.

I stayed at Harrah's, one of the host hotels for the show. It ... sucked.

You know, every few years, Vegas goes through a a molting, where new hotels spring up and the old ones do a facelift, but the premise is still the same, and the results are still the same, only now it all just looks tired.

What used to be cool about Vegas doesn't exist anymore. It had its own brands, and those brands were quintessentially Vegas. Now it has those brands, only remade, shadows of their former selves to the point where they're unrecognizable as what they originally were, plus a bunch of big nasty theme hotels, and a bunch of outlets from other cities. There's nothing really uniquely ""Vegas"" that I could discern anymore. Even the fancy hotels like Caesar's are starting to look past their prime, and guess what? It's brand new.

Why on earth I'd want to go to Vegas to experience restaurants, the original branch of which is in another city, I'm not sure. They never meet up with what you'd expect from the original, so what's the point? Why I'd ever go to Rao's in Vegas is a mystery. The reason it's hard to get into in NYC is because... it's Rao's. Lightning doesn't strike twice like that. It just becomes contrived. Stone Crab? A pale imitation of the original, from what I understand. They're actually banking on the fact that you never went to the original and won't be able to compare, because they don't stack up. They're hoping you'll buy into the brands, regardless. Listen here, ignoramuses (if you qualify), YOU NEED TO GO TO THE ORIGINAL. 

The west side of the strip near Caesar's, Bellagio, etc., is almost like going to Disneyland, because you are forced to walk past stores in order to even walk down the street. You can't cross a street without being guided upstairs to some stores, to then have to walk on a bridge across the street you were intending to cross, into another yet another mall with MORE stores, and down the stairs back to the street level. What's worse is there's not one unique store in any of the indoor malls these enormo hotels have thrust in your path. Ferragamo, Victoria's Secret, Kenneth Cole, Cartier, followed by Cartier, Kenneth Cole, Ferragamo, and Victoria's Secret. It's ludicrous, but it must be working for them, otherwise they wouldn't do it.

The recession has hit Vegas and Nevada hard, I know, and it shows. But then again, this is the issue with Vegas, it's not constructed for long life, and so everything starts looking kind of shoddy fairly quickly.

It still preys on the hopes and dreams and addictions of those who are unable to do anything but succumb, but even worse, any vestige of a soul that Vegas used to have has been supplanted by mindless control-freak commercialism, and you get fleeced at every turn. No, there is no soul left there at all. I can't figure out what is appealing enough about this city that would make anyone want to live there, but then again, I could say that about most of the country, so there you have it. It's possible that by being a victim of the show and the strip, I missed something, but until someone shows me different, I just don't get it.",1
Local Flavor,"What do you think of when someone mentions Las Vegas? Sin City? Rack Rack City? Gambling? Legalized prostitution? Gambling? Nightlife? Buffets? Cirque Du Soliel shows? Well all of the above and more are there, but there's another side of Las Vegas I want to write about. That is shopping. Lots of shopping malls here (Fashion Show Mall) and retail stores within the hotels (Cesar Palace Forum Shops, and Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile, etc) on The Strip. I am always able to find great deals on shirts, jeans, jackets, etc to upgrade my wardrobe. Not sure if the deals are all year round, but it's definitely there when I'm here during the Thanksgiving weekend. It's so nice to see the cash register ring up half the total of retail prices on items I buy.",4
Local Flavor,"One of the worst cities my career has brought me to. The schools are trash, the drivers are trash (LA driving isn't even thid bad.) Everything is expensive, everything looks identical, houses,people, etc. Looking forward to my leaving, I'll never return. If I want to gamble, I'll go to next door Lake Charles, LA.",2
Local Flavor,"What can I say about Sin City that hasn't been said?  Entertainment mecca? Done. What happens in....  Well we all know that by now.

What I can say is that I was fortunate enough to live there for 6 years, and while it took a long minute to truly appreciate all the extremes that exist in this city.  I loved it.

Reared in NYC, it's a hard pill for me to swallow when I go somewhere and things aren't open late or 24 hours.  Not the case in Vegas.  I'd have to say it's even more of a 24 hour town than the ole Big Apple.

World class shows, Broadway productions on steroids, a growing and accessible rock music scene and an art-filled First Friday?  Accessible entertainment prices.  Low cost housing  (well at least for someone from NYC).  Red Rock Canyon and Valley of Fire.  All amazing.

Now for the not so good stuff.  Medical care is just not up to par with other cities I've lived in.  Follow up is pretty bad, with the exception of one dentist, who I wish I was able to bring back to the East Coast with me.  Neighborhoods just aren't community driven like you see in the East Coast.  People basically go from their garage to their jobs and back into their garages.

Food?  Just not enough variety, nor easily reached.  

The I-15.  Ugh, this main artery for Las Vegans to get around the city.  Yikes!  One accident and a 20 mile trip can take 2 hours or more if you can't get off.  

Which brings me to auto insurance and drivers.  Insurance is sky high.  Our car insurance doubled in Vegas and our motorcycle quadrupled.  It didn't matter that we lived behind a 20 foot wall, with 30 foot gates, 24 hour guards and concierge, with valet parking and underground garage.

Would I do it again?  In a NY minute.",5
Local Flavor,"I've only been 3 times, but there's just something about Vegas. Something that just makes me keep going back. I guess it's because there is so much to do! And the people in Vegas are all there to party and have a good time, so everyone is in a good mood! You can't really find anyone that's mad at being there! I can't believe it gets cold there in the winter though... I was thinking since it's the desert, it'd be warm, but boy was I wrong!",4
Local Flavor,"This I love about Vegas:

1) Awesome dining

2) 24/7 entertainment

3) The over the top glitz on the strip!

4) There is stuff outside of the Strip that is pretty cool, like the Neon Museum, land sailing, gun ranges and even Fremont Street (after dark).

Things I hate about Vegas:

1) You can't catch a cab on the street.  WHAT WHAT???

2) Everywhere on/near the strip is nearly impossible to drive to because of traffic

3) Outside of the attractions I mentioned above, the city is actually more like a tiny suburb and a smidge depressing.

But still, love Vegas, and while I wouldn't ever live here, I'm definitely buying a vacation home here.",4
Local Flavor,"Reviews on citys excite me.
How can you really judge and review a whole city?
I will try, LV  needs no explaining as to how it is.
We have all had a great  time there, you can't go and nothing happens.
It will always be fun, crazy, memorable, weather you are 8 or 80 years old you will have fun seeing all they offer which is always something!
Everything in Vegas changes all the time.
You will see new casinos, different shows, hotels and restaurants changing, remodel and so on.
You can get good deals, shopping is great and everything is easy to walk to.
Great weather pretty much all year round, I'm glad I live close now, just in case I get the itch, love it here!",5
Local Flavor,"200th Review of 2013!!!  Might as well make it the city I live in. 

There are so many quotes, sayings, and cliches about Las Vegas.  You have ""Sin City"", ""Lost Wages"", ""the Silver State"", and my favorite ""What Happens In Vegas, Stays In Vegas"" to name a few.  But for me, it's now ""Home Sweet Home"".  

Been visiting the city of Las Vegas at least 5 times a year since 1998.  It wasn't until 2011 that I can now consider Vegas my home.  Prior to moving here, my purpose out here was to visit friends and lose a ton of money.  I also can't forget visiting the zoo every once in awhile where you'd spot the occasional crazy horse, cheetah, and even a spearmint rhino.  Now my purpose is work, friends, family, and to make money.  And because of the lower cost of living compared to my hometown San Diego, that money sure lasts a lot longer out here.  

Las Vegas is known for gambling and entertainment. Been coming out here for years to party.  Now I'm partying only when friends and family come from out of town. I love this city and learned that there's a lot more to offer than just casinos, hotels, shopping, and entertainment.  In the short time I lived here, I discovered that Las Vegas is one of the most convenient cities around.  Distance from South to North is only about 20 miles.  Within these 20 miles, you have everything that the heart desires.  One of the biggest perks for living in this city is the local discounts, cheap strong pours, no income tax, minimal traffic, great hikes, and a ton of restaurants.  Don't get me wrong, still love and miss San Diego. But in the meantime, Las Vegas is my ""Home Sweet Home"".

Local Flavor,"I LOVE YOU, LV

Vegas is definitely one of my happy places. Good food, good drinks, good eye candy. It's a place for the adults. A giant playground of awesome. 

Personally, I'm more of a Fremont Vegas than Strip Vegas person. I love the old downtown Experience. But many fun night have been had walked the main street as well. 

My cousins have lived in Vegas for many years. Perhaps they are more responsible than I, because I'm sure living there is not a good idea for me. Although, I think work would be easy to find. Go-go dancing is probably out of the question, but I could open up one of those touristy gun places, where you can shoot automatic weapons in the desert. And husband could give the helicopter ride out there. Perhaps we'd do just fine in Vegas.

But for now, it's just a great vacation spot. I wish I were poolside at the Flamingo right now!

Viva!",5
Local Flavor,"I first visited Las Vegas in 1972 and I came back for vacation almost every year until I moved here in 2001.  I love this crazy, wonderful, bright light city and its history.

There are so many things to do within a short drive of Las Vegas.  We have several National Recreation areas, two National Conservation areas, theatre, entertainment venues at Strip hotels, and all the other activities that go with a city of nearly 2,000,000 people.  How many places can you snow ski in the morning and water ski that same day?

Many thanks to the deceased first lady of Las Vegas, Helen Stewart.  If she hadn't kept her family together and stayed here after her husband's murder at the Kiel Ranch, the railroad probably would have passed us by and the city wouldn't exist as it does today.  Instead, she sold the Las Vegas Ranch to the railroad and that started us out.  From there, laws--mainly gambling-- and then the building of Hoover Dam helped bring this city toward the future it has.

And it's still growing.  Bright light city--you have set my soul on fire!",5

I have driven around some, tried some restaurants away from the Strip, and have some friends that live here.  Overall, it's just a fun place, you just have to bear the heat though.",4
Local Flavor,"Review #200 belongs to Sin City...

Las Vegas was my home for 3 years, and although I missed the beaches, the farmers markets, and my family & friends back in SoCal, we made the best of it, we made it our home.  Before moving to Las Vegas, my husband and I were regular tourists to the Strip.  We have stayed at almost every hotel, seen almost every Cirque show, and have tried many of the Celebrity Chef's restaurants.  But, that is all we knew until we were ""locals"" and forced to explore the other things that the city had to offer.  For once you are a local, and accustom to no traffic, you avoid the Strip at all costs.  

We learned that Las Vegas is more than bright lights, slot machines, outlet shopping, and unlimited alcohol.  With 2 young kids, we had slim pickings for kid friendly activities, but we did find them, and we made the best of it.  The new Discovery Children's Museum was one of our favorites, along with the many parks in Summerlin (although, the parks are just too hot in the summer).  We took advantage of the events and story time activities at the public library.  

Some of my favorite parts of the city include: The new Smith Center, a great venue for theater and culture.  The Downtown Art scene is growing along with the great bars and restaurants.  The beautiful Red Rock Canyon offers great hiking and biking.  And of course I will miss the lower cost of living, the lack of traffic, and no state income tax.  But, since we still own a home in Las Vegas and made many new friends, we will definitely be back!

So on your next visit to Las Vegas, step outside of the Strip, and know that the city has so much more to offer!

*Yelp 100 Challenge: Review 60/100*",4
Local Flavor,Las Vegas is pretty cool. It can get pretty hot during the summer time but it is definitely a place to enjoy and have some fun at,5
Local Flavor,"AH, Sin City!  What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...  unless you use Yelp!  Then you gotta write a review!  

It had been a while since my last visit to this fun town.  Almost too long.  We had reason as my daughter's dance team was scheduled to compete here over the July 4th weekend.  Yes, it was hot.  It was even over 100 and climbing as we drove through the desert at sunset to get there.

Well, this visit did not disappoint.  Aside from the dance competition, there were some new attractions and hotels that had sprung up since my last visit as well as the need to visit some oldies but goodies.  The Aria and Cosmopolitan hotels were new near the center of the strip.  Not necessarily new this year, but new since the last time I visited.  I'm pretty sure they were in the process of being built, but can't say for sure. Anyway, those are two newer hotels that are conjoined by a nice high end mall.  

The lights along the strip are stunning.  Huge billboards that are super clear and crisp line most every hotel.  I wish I had something like that in my living room to watch ball games on!  Must say, the girls on the strip seem to a bit more visible and aggressive than what I remember in trips past.  

All in all, good times in Vegas this time around!

Keep on Yelp'n!",4
Local Flavor,"As a sole female traveler that has been to different cities in North America, Europe, Asia and Africa - I appreciate Las Vegas from a tourist's point-of-view.  When I pick a travel destination, I think about several factors: cost, safety, transportation/being able to get from point A to point B, food and basic human needs while away from home, attractions, activities and photo op.

Cost:
You can always find deals for your Vegas trip online. You can find nice a hotel room for an average of $170-250/night.  Flights to/from Vegas are cheap if you book at least 3 months in advance. Sales tax is 8.1%.

Safety:
I've walked alone in the French Quarter in New Orleans at 4am where I saw bums, shit-faced drunk people and bystanders that were EXTRA FRIENDLY.  A guy tried to mug me in Barcelona at 8am which forced me to headbutt him with my hard noggin.  In Vegas, you walk alone and you will never feel unsafe because the city is always filled with tourists and not a high incidence of people getting mugged/pick pocketed, etc. But now, if you go downtown, there are bums and drunks that will try to talk to you but for the most part - they're harmless...nothing a kick in the nuts couldn't fix if need be.

Transportation and Getting from Point A to Point B:
I find such joy in riding the metro and trains in Europe and some parts of Asia - it's fun not to drive or sit in traffic. Well, Vegas doesn't have metro/trains - I'd imagine it would be like a sauna in the summer if Vegas had them. However, you can find taxi cabs pretty much everywhere. You can get a single ride ticket, one-day pass up to a week pass for the monorail. There are buses that are quite on-time. Or you can rent a car and drive and not worry about traffic on the 95, 15 or 215 - it can get busy especially from Thursday-Monday because of all the tourists coming in to the city but it's nothing major. This is not L.A. Be careful on the 15 between Charleston and Sahara though - high accident rate area. Then of course, you can walk on the Strip. Hop from one hotel/casino to another.  It's easy since they're right next to each other and it's good exercise.

Food:
My favorite topic! Before I visit a city, I always research the best places to eat at and what to get. Zagat, Michelin, TripAdvisor and of course, Yelp are my sources. Vegas has so many good restaurants that fit any budget. We have a lot of celebrity chefs such as Michael Mina, Emeril Lagasse, Mario Battali, Joel Robuchon, Wolfgang Puck and many others. We have great buffets and AYCE sushi. Local restaurants and hole in the wall places.

Basic Human Needs:
There are pharmacies and gas stations about a block away from each other. Each hotel has a gift shop if you need something. Restrooms are clean, free and are in each hotel/casino, store and restaurant. We have running water, soap, toilet paper, paper towels/hand dryers and toilet seat covers. Vegas restrooms are awesome if you've been to any parts of the world. Squatting toilets in Asia...oh boy! I always bring my own supplies when I'm elsewhere.

Attractions, Activities and Photo Op:
Where else could you go where you could be in Paris, Venice, Monte Carlo and New York in one day? The hotels/casinos look amazing and perfect for taking pictures. The famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign, Fountains of Bellagio, Bellagio Botanical Garden, Mandalay Beach, MGM lion, New York New York rollercoaster, Eiffel Tower, gondolas at the Venetian, statues in Caesar's Palace...too many photo ops! So keep your batteries charged and memory sticks ready. You can watch shows such as Blue Man Group, Cirque du Soleil (Ka, Beatles Love, Zumanity, O, Michael Jackson, etc.), La Reve, Absinthe, etc. Zip line, helicopter tour of the Strip or to the Grand Canyon while flying over the Hoover Dam, Smith Center if you want to watch musicals, spend a relaxing day in Lake Las Vegas, ski/snowboard in Mt. Charleston in the winter. Nightclubs, dayclubs, pools, lounges and strip clubs. Go shopping at Fashion Show Mall, Forum Shops, Premium Outlets, etc. Gamble. There's always something to do for everyone.

Whatever happens in Vegas goes on Facebook...Instagram...Twitter. Welcome to Vegas!",5
Local Flavor,"The best chefs in the world have their restaurants here, so do the best artists also come perform in Vegas. If that's not enough, most casinos have great accommodations, with fantastic pools. Yes, and you can smoke, drink, eat foie-gras, shoot exotic guns, skydive, get a massage, do a little gambling, and dance the night away! Las Vegas is the playground for adults. If you fancy haute cuisine, put in some effort and dress the part, and you will get the best table. Vegas favors the best dressed people in town!",5
Local Flavor,"Viva Lost Wages. This city has it all. Literally; the rich, the poor, the klassy, the trashy, the slutty, the prude, hell they have everything... even Yule Brenner a time or two...

One night in Bangkok doesn't hold a candle to one night in Vegas. The gambling, the strip bars, the alcohol, hell if you got the cash you can likely find it in Vegas. One night in Bangkok should be rewritten for this place:

One night in Vegas and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the god's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

Or

One night in Vegas makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Vegas and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me

Tell me that isn't an apt description of Sin City? If you want to find it here, you will... 

Personally I love this town at times and hate it at others. When you are here during the weekend, its non-stop uncontrolled craziness, during the week, the population is halved from the weekends and slowed way down to just crazy. 

Its close to a lot of fun activities other than just gambling gluttony and shows of visible excitement. For example there is; Hoover Dam, Lake Mead, Red Rock Canyon, the Grand Canyon, etc etc etc. Don't forget that most of the casinos are in and of themselves tourist destinations to see as well as eat shop and gamble like; Statosphere tower, Luxor Pyramid, NY NY Roller Coaster, Circus Circus Midway, etc.

Let alone the food here now is unbelievably good now. Yes you can still find the cut rate cheap buffet here or there, but most of the hotels and restaurants in town are definitely cutting edge fresh and super tasty. Albeit some want to break the bank, but many are well within reason.

Dang I wish I could go back right now... I miss this place and all the good and bad things that come from it. See you there soon!",4
Local Flavor,"Vegas is the city of the 7 deadly sins.. mostly lust and greed.  For me...gluttony. I eat south when I come to Vegas because there's so many restaurants and buffets.

You can eat, shop, gamble, see a show, go to a club, party, do things not PG-13. There's tons of things to do for everyone even kids. 

Where else can you go and feel like you are in Venice, Rio and Egypt? Everything inVegas is done up big and bright. Things are always changing here which is nice and keeps things fresh. 

What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas  unless you post it on social media then that's on you!",5
Local Flavor,"I have been to Vegas over a dozen times now, starting in 2003, and I can say it has gotten better and better over the years.  If I was writing this review ten years ago, I'd probably give it 3 stars. But with the recent additions of The Cosmopolitan, Aria, Wynn, and the revamping of many old hotels, there are so many great options for food, fun, gambling, entertainment, and pools.  

Even after eight years of avoiding Downtown Vegas, it too has gotten better over time.  It is definitely still cheaper and tackier than The Strip, but this is Vegas, so it all works.  Downtown has some remodeled hotels as well, so you can actually find some nice rooms there for a fraction of the Strip prices.  Give it a try. 

My Top 3 Hotels:
1) The Cosmopolitan
2) The Wynn
3) The Bellagio

The Cosmopolitan is home to my favorite bars and restaurant.  For me, it doesn't get any better than Bond and The Chandelier bars or more delicious than Scarpetta.  Also, I'm not a guy who goes to clubs, but the Marquee Day Club is a great time.  These are all must dos when in Vegas.

Here's my overall list for Vegas:
http://www.yelp.com/list/vegas-las-vegas-114",5
Local Flavor,"City of Las Vegas   the sin city  has   something for everybody  and i mean everybody.
 
if you want sightseeing 
   it offers trips to the grand canyon , the hoover dam  

if you want
 fine dining it has that in abundance . 
. 
gambling .
.of course.  and slot machine everywhere they  are at the airport and ive seen them in the rest rooms ( joking) 

if your taste is 
 broadway type shows there are many   usually at less than broadway  prices 

alcohol 
available   24/7 no blue laws here  .

shopping 
plenty  of mails full of all the top designers from the world of fashion    
  

 night life 
 Las Vegas is renowned  for its late night clubs  situated in the best and most exclusive  casino/hotels 

 something for kids
 yes . circus circus and .many other attractions to keep  them occupied  
 
 adult  entertainment
 if thats what  rocks your boat .
 a trip to the bunny ranch  is a 2 hours drive away .

sports
 you can swim, play golf,  rock climb , ski  etc  or just watch live games in the    sports bars of  the  hotels .

Yes and for those  who lead a more sheltered life there are churches of all denominations .

every  type of social pleasure is catered for  here .  


 Ive  been visiting Las Vegas  for 20 odd  years  now and it only  gets better.
  I remember  some of the  old casinos like the *Dunes *  stardust *that have  been replaced    by larger magnificent architectural masterpieces  that offer everything  from gambling  to fine dining and everything   in between.  these resorts cover  what in any other city would be a whole block .
 yes the newer  ones  are a little more expensive room wise but specials can be had almost anytime of the  year just research the net for what  you need .

the older casinos have the best deals but you only get what you pay for .

 had a  timeshare for years which was  used to stay  at * polo towers *  but with the increasing cost each year of the exchange clubs and the maintenance it was  found to be  cheaper to ditch  the *time share* and go with the ever present specials  .

the price of everything has of course increased as much to do with the popularity of the town as the economy.
 in most hotels restaurants   a price of a beer is  around $7 and there  is not so many freebees to get you to gamble / eat /stay at a certain casino . 

 the magic    of the city is still there 

  its vibrant ,the lights along  the strip .its  people friendly  and safe, you can walk along the strip with your camera slung over your shoulder with not much of a chance of it getting snatched .

.no need  to rent a car not easy and expensive to park  there is a bus service goes up and down the street every 10 mins or  so and some of the   hotels have a overhead  train service called monorail  free   connecting them, there are  plenty of taxis  to be hailed at a reasonable  cost .
 anyway walking along  the strip is fun, full of  hustlers selling time  share presentations ,  or handing out flyers  depicting nude girls and the clubs they  can be found in .

 

then there are the street musicians   ,artists and of course ELVIS *  lots of them*  with the water ballet at the bellagio , the volcano  at the mirage, and the pirate show at treasure  island  you can have a whole days entertainment   without spending a dime  .

   im in love with Vegas, yes its a bit decadent thats what makes it great,  my favourite vacation spot and i go there as often  as  i can 
.what  happens in Vegas   stays in Vegas ! 
..well you judge that  for yourself",5
Local Flavor,"We've been coming to Las Vegas about every 2 years for the last 15 years, and we've always enjoyed ourselves but boy has it changed over the years. We just got back from what will probably be our last trip. Although we're not gamblers we've always had a good time in Vegas, the shows, pools, eats, museums, people watching. There's just a ton of stuff to do. One of our favorite things to do in Vegas is walk, walking from one casino to the next, maybe sit and have a drink before moving to the next one. Each casino is unique and there's always something to see or shopping or just people watch. The issue is the aggressive show and tour sellers on the sidewalks and the homeless beggars on the bridges. When I say no I'm not interested in what you're selling I mean no. Don't chase after me and keep trying, the Irish Bitch will come out and then watch out I can't control what she'll say. Then my husband and I argue because I've been rude, when if they'd just take my first ""no thank you"" there wouldn't be a problem. I was on my cell phone, having just received bad news, crying and one of them was chasing after me trying to ""give"" me free show tickets. Believe me nothing they're ""giving"" away is really free. The numerous beggars who sit on the bridges and make rude/crude comments as you walk by and don't give them hand-outs aren't any more pleasant. It's bad enough having to dodge the timeshare sellers in the hotels, the ""street sellers"" just make the experience that much worse. As long as Vegas allows these practices to continue unabated we will find somewhere else to vacation. I work too hard at a job I hate to spend money for this.",1
Local Flavor,"To all tourists, Vegas residents to do not live in casinos nor do we eat buffets everyday. There is a legitimate city outside of the strip and we do everything you do in your home city. We work, go to school, grocery shop, go to the movies and stay far away from the Strip as much as possible. 


I moved here almost 8 years ago and hated it for a long time since I was away from my family. The longer I live here, the more I appreciate it everyday. 

I'll make this review simple for anyone that is considering moving here. 

Pros
-Nothing ever closes!!! Ever!!! You'll always find what you're looking for at 2 am, whether it's a burger, a coffee or tampons at Walmart. 
-There's such a wide variety of restaurants to choose from. You'll never run out of places to eat.
-Cost of living is ridiculously affordable. For my one bedroom apartment in a gated community with a washer and dryer in a nicer part of town is only $750. My friends is Cali pay more than $1200 for way less.

Cons
-No sense of community. This is such a commuter city and everyone works different hours. No one knows their neighbors.
-Houses are built way too close to one another. You can pretty much high five your neighbor from your bedroom window. 
-The freeways here are in one big circle. So if you are trying to get from Henderson to North Summerlin, you could side street it or take the freeway and go around. Either way it'll be a good 35 minute drive. 
-Education is horrible!!! Nevada is last with public school test scores. Education isn't a priority when you can make over $100k being a bartender. 

I could go on and on about pros and cons but this review would never end. I'm happy where I am now, but I wouldn't want Las Vegas to be my permanent residence.",4
Local Flavor,City of Las Vegas Sewer Service.  I would like to say a huge THANK YOU for the almost instant response the sewer service crew gave when I called about a possible stoppage.  Within 15 minutes of my FIRST call the team was outside my house running the main sewer line for a blockage. WELL DONE and THANK YOU.,5
Local Flavor,"You know, you've burned many, many bridges for me. But like a dummy head, I always come crawling back for you. You've taken my money, made me wait for hours on end, hurt me both physically and emotionally, but my love for you has stayed unconditional. There's never a dull moment with you, there's always something new to explore. And what happens in Vegas doesn't always stay in Vegas. Such is love when it comes to the city of sin. My happiest place on Earth.. Till we meet again.",5
Local Flavor,"It was a lot of fun, but constantly being harassed by the people trying to get you to go to the time share presentations gets very annoying after a while, but I understand that people have to make a living so I guess it's bearable  :-/ The strip was definitely more fun than the actual Las Vegas part of Vegas haha (I guess Fremont St downtown is old Vegas). It's pretty easy getting free show tickets to keep yourself busy while here so I wouldn't worry too much about securing those before coming. It's very much a city you can come to spontaneously  :-)",4
Local Flavor,5 stars just aint enough.. where Champions become National Champions!,5
Local Flavor,as a Portland metroer I fucking love this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11,5
Local Flavor,"Las Vegas is like spring break. Except all of the people are adults and more pathetic. I was hungover, walking on the strip in 2005 when a hooker asked what I was getting into. I told her I was feeling sick and stay away. She didn't listen. I puked and it almost landed on her shoes. That is the perfect metaphor for Las Vegas. A prostitute ducking vomit.",1

Local Flavor,"Vivaaaaa las Vegaaaaas, Vivaaaaa las Vegaaaas, Viva...VIVAAAAA LAS VEGAAAAAAS !

Et ouais, quand je pense à Vegas je pense à cette chanson mais aussi pêle-mêle à Elvis, à des lumières de partout, à un parc d'attraction en haut d'une tour, à une ville entièrement animée par des shows, à des casinos, à des mariages minutes, à Brad Pitt, à Robert de Niro, à Bradley Cooper, à voyager dans différentes villes tout en traversant la rue, encore à des lumières partout, à des verres de tailles inhumaines, au M&M's Store, au fait que ce soit une ville qui soit en plein désert, à Sin City, aux buffets à volonté... Ma liste est longue , mais rien ne vaudra la réalité à tout ce que j'ai pu imaginer dans ma tête. On est dans le cliché, plus ou moins réussi, mais on est surtout dans le spectacle !

Vegas, une ville de fous furieux ou je n'ai jamais enchainé les  nuits aussi courtes de toute ma vie, parce que... le temps défile. Par principe, le fait de pas avoir d'heure dans les casinos, c'est pas une bonne idée hein ! Mais en sachant que là-bas un "" simple "" hôtel devient à musée à entrée gratuite, on a envie de tous les voir, de tout visiter, de tous les comparer. Mais ça, c'est mission impossible ! Tous les hôtels sont uniques en leur genre !
Mais Vegas est également une ville unique, vraiment à faire une fois au moins dans sa vie, ça a aussi un côté qui en jette ! C'est une ville qui fait le show, qui ne s'arrete jamais. Ou verrez-vous un volcan en éruption en pleine ville ? A Vegas ! Ou verrez-vous une guerre des gangs sur un bateau pirate entre les Pussycat Dolls et les 2B3 ? A Vegas ! Ou verrez-vous des fontaines danser au rythme de la musique ? A Vegaaaaaas ! Vous verrez tout à Vegas ! Ce n'est pas la ville que je préfère aux US, mais on ne peut l'éviter lors d'un trip ! Impossible !
 
Je vous raconterai bien mon séjour, mais vous connaissez l'adage : What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas ;)",5
Local Flavor,"I love to visit las vegas but the city needs to get rid of the bums/beggars on the overpasses on the strip.  Not to be confused with the hawkers and water salesmen, these are drug addicts and alcoholics. And they are begging for their drug of choice.

The overpass from nyny to the mgm was particurlarly bad.",4
Local Flavor,"The greatest city in the world! Maybe I'm a little bias, but I absolutely love it here. The nights are magical, the food is incredible, and it's my hometown!",5
Local Flavor,"I guess u know u got a lot to say when it takes u a minute or two to start just thinking of all the fun my Vegas trips have been. I've been here about a dozen times and it never gets old. Always something new to see as a tourist. Now living here is a whole other animal as anywhere else I imagine. So In a nutt shell (cuz I don't want to write a book) being from Miami, here is my Vegas review. Restaurants 5 stars, entertainment 5 stars, hotels 5 stars, nightlife 4 stars. Gambling 5 stars, fun 5 stars, people attractiveness 4 stars, miscellaneous party stuff 3 stars, convention events 5 stars, pool parties 5 stars, Vegas strip clubs 4 stars. Of coarse this all depends on where u go but in a general sense of it all this place rocks. I've had the time of life here. Always a pleasure coming back. Things to be cautious n careful of are prostitutes, overly priced drinks, no balconies on hotels, cig smoke everywhere, cabs can only b caught at hotels, try to catch the tram as much as possible oppose to cabs, it's rare u get to enjoy anything for free there. But still if u got loot Vegas gots the time of ur life awaiting u. Go!",5

Local Flavor,"As a kid, I loved this place.

As a teen, I hated it.

As a grownup, I now just feel this odd, conflicted paradox of love/hate with this bizarre attachment thrown in. 

As a child I adored The Strip. Seeing all the neon lights, the themes, the blend of old and new and just the general craziness. Now it's become a corporate and ~modernized~ monstrous shell of it's former self, with all the gleaming, glass towers and overpriced clubs, shops and eateries held within being even more garish than what people claim it was in the past. But I enjoy The Linq and how it's set the ball rolling for the pedestrian-friendly promenade trend. 

The place is overrun with people who are untrustworthy, smug, judgmental, spoiled, prosthetic (figuratively AND literally), ridiculously materialistic and cliquish. But then there's my friends. Childhood friends, high school friends and the people I roll with now. I wouldn't trade any of them for the world. 

Race and ethnicity were virtually non-issues here when I was a child. And yet now it seems that things are getting bizarrely segregated here. But at the same time the cultural diversity has grown tenfold. In terms of businesses, festivals and what have you, the offerings are beginning to rival what can be found in Cali. 

The ""nice"" houses are monotonous cookie cutters. Some of the one story houses are heinous to the point where the entire front facade is made up of the garage. Many of them require you drive/walk around ten miles of walls before you have to go through a gate to even access the house. Oh, and then there's HOA's who are intrusive, obnoxious and utterly ridiculous to the point that they object to signs of a normal neighborhood like kids playing outside or two people sitting and talking on the porch/front lawn/driveway of THEIR OWN house. All of that can be yours for $3k or more. As for me on the other hand, I'd rather find me a Mid-Century gem like an atomic ranch in Paradise Palms. Or a charming railroad cottage in the vicinity of DTLV. Most of the time these can be had for less than $2k.

Unlike just about EVERYWHERE ELSE, the local history and culture is by and large disregarded. In any other town, there would have been an uproar if iconic hotels were imploded (see: the Sands and the Stardust), or if a historic theater is allowed to just sit and crumble (see: the Huntridge). Yet here, such things are responded to with apathy at best and acclaim at worst. The things that give this place character and a unique identity are forfeited in return for generic, corporate monotony. Ok, ok, at least recently that's finally started to change. The Mob Museum is a testament to a part of our history that for so long so many people tried to hide. The El Cortez, Golden Gate and various other buildings on Fremont St. are being added to the NHRP. The Huntridge has finally attracted local interest in renovation. Hell, not even a week ago, a sign was erected on Bonanza near Main St. signifying the ""Historic Westside"" which pays tribute to the Moulin Rouge! 

I wasn't born here, but I was raised here, which basically makes it home (even though your typical Vegas-born would insist otherwise). Aside from sporadic trips and family, I don't know much about my birthplace. I may have just been too hard on Vegas in the past. I mean, it's only a little bit older than 100 years old after all! For years it seemed like most of the city was soulless strip malls and chains. But now the new ""villages"" are all the rage and mom and pops are making a comeback. The local art and creative scene finally feels like it's starting to go somewhere. All the redevelopment going on in DTLV and the central parts of town are giving me hope that soon we'll have more neighborhoods with a soul (even though that's partially because of gentrification, but that's a different post for a different day). I used to think the great potential this place had in the past was lost, but I guess it just goes to show that the recession was just as much a gift as it was a curse locally speaking. 

Although it's not gonna happen for another couple of years, I'm still interested in leaving. I'm young, and I didn't travel much as a child. I want to see and experience different places. In all honesty, I think my lifestyle could very well be as a modern-day nomad. But maybe one day I might want to return here and settle down. After all, as much as I loathe what this place became in the late 90s/00s, I appreciate how it's changing for the better in the 10s. Only time will tell really.",3
Local Flavor,"This is in regards to the Las Vegas Parking Services Office. I recieved a citation today and called. First off the woman on the other side of the phone answered ""citation number"".. what? Cant say hello? I get it your job probably sucks but you dont have to be rude right when you answer.

Anyways I asked her why we had the citation because the ticket has no reason. She snapped back and said there is a reason all right. She said because the registration sticker was expired. I asked ""dont you have access to the DMV records? We just ordered it. Its on the way."" She said no we do not have access and thats not my problem.

Really? Stop trying to suck money out of us for stupid shit. I will park my car on private property so that you can stare at my expired sticker and not do anything about it.

#moneyhungryaholes.",1
Local Flavor,"Las Vegas is a fun place to visit if you're 21+.

However living here? Bleh. Only live here if you don't have a family.

Clark County School District sucks for kids and we're 49th in the country for quality of education. The only good schools are the magnet schools, or private schools, or schools on the west side of town (Summerlin, where all the rich folk from Beverly Hills come to reside to get away from California taxes).

For the longest time, Las Vegas as a city has no 'culture' to speak of aside from the glitz and glam of the hotel strip. Sure there are a few museums and libraries here and there, but not much in terms of enrichment for families who are sick of 'The Strip'.

Las Vegas was a soul-less as it could get once you get past the simulacrum of hotels and casinos. Outside of the area, it was all suburb after suburb after suburb of cookie-cutter houses, and some crack houses on the side of G - D street and downtown/northeast LV area.

Downtown Las Vegas was completely lacking for the longest time and was subpar compared to the rich downtown centers of bigger cities, such as LA or Chicago. There is a once-a-month movement that happens in the downtown area, called 'First Friday' that attempts to bring the arts into the city. However, efforts are still dismal considering that downtown LV has been the hotbed for bums, crack houses and cheap gambling for the longest time.

Now that downtown LV has the Smith Center, the place has classed up a bit in the past few years. There is now an effort to bring more of the visual and performing arts into the city, something that was severely lacking (shows on the strip don't count; we're talking about classic stuff here like The Nutcracker or going to see a symphony performance of some Beethoven music live).

Growing up here has a kid sucked as there wasn't much to do under the age of 21. However, living here is cheap compared to other states; just don't expect a lot of options when it comes to entertainment and recreational activities off the strip. Remember, you'll be doing this gig for more than a year; I've done it for almost a decade and have seen it all.",3
Local Flavor,"Well I always wanted to know what las vegas was like! Now I know it really sucks ! The health care, Clark county school district, stores, transportation, apartments/housing and etc. Firstly, health care yea there are a few good doctors out here but not enough!    I had to wait more than 3 weeks just for the Dr office to put a ultra sound test in the computer! After the Dr told me in my face that the ultrasound referral is in the computer! He told me all I've is stop by the front desk to get referral! Secondly, the grade schools out here are overcrowded! The classrooms are hot ! Ive nephews and nieces that has to go to school out here!  The stores are too far away from home! Unless you feel like walking at least a mile or more to the store ! Then you better get a car ! Thirdly, The public transportation here is a joke! The buses supposed to come in 30 minutes it will not come for another 2 hours! This is while you are sitting there under a boiling sun ! Fourthly, the rent is cheaper than other cities!  But, there are other expenses that are not included in rent that must have like lights, heat and water. Also if you are on a budget it's gonna be too hard ! In the summer months are very long ! Summer starts in sometime in April last till middle of October ! So your light bill can be as much as $300 a month or more ! This is when you don't run the air conditioner all day!  This is just running air conditioner part of the day! You are turning it off and on! You are still hot cause the walls don't hold air conditioner! So if its 120 degrees  outside then your house is about 120 ! It's hardly cold! The water bill can fluctuate too from $40 a month to $100 a month! It depends on how much water you use to bathe, wash dishes, flush the toilets and other stuff that requires water ! The water out here taste awful ! My dog would never drink that water! So you have to pay for a expensive service like sparkletts water to deliver your water ! Or go to a water filling station and have your own water bottles! Last, is the church I went to was awful! Not welcoming ! Made me feel very uncomfortable! I feel I didn't belong there! I lived here since June 11 2014 ! I'm so blessed to have people who really love me in Chicago! I will be moving back there April 25 2015 thanks God! I'm never coming back to Vegas!!!!!!",1
Local Flavor,"My second home close to home!  

I go home (Vegas) at least 1-4 times a year since i turned 21. Never gets old. Always new. Perfect to just get away and just be free whether it be relaxing/tanning by the pool, partying, site seeing, eating, watch a show, visting a friend, wedding, bachelorette, birthdays, spur of the moment, R&R, S&G, business, etc! its always an enjoyment. 

You see and meet so many people from all around the world. I loved these australian group of guys and girls that we met at Marquee. Theyre so friendly -- they saved and waited a year for this Vegas trip and i'm over here like - Vegas right now? ok lets go. 

Its always a great experience & time in Vegas with my friends new and old. Win or lose. 

What happens in Vegas, does NOT stay in Vegas! YOLO!",5
Local Flavor,Always a bad ass place to just say fuck it lets roll last second !!!! I decided to roll out at 2 o'clock and here by none from so cal !!! Great Harley ride !!! Beautiful drive,5
Local Flavor,"The City of Las Vegas is amazing in so many ways! But remember: the Strip is NOT in the City of Las Vegas. 

I repeat, the Strip is not actually part of Las Vegas. Everything south of the Stratosphere is non-Vegas land. Thus, if all you saw was the airport and the Strip, you never really visited Las Vegas. And that is all the more reason to head north and check out Downtown (or west or east too).

Vegas, both city proper and the crazy thing that is the non-Vegas Strip, have a unique and interesting history. I am forever fascinated by how the city came into being and all the old timey photographs. Did you Vegas was basically founded by Mormons? Vegas really never gets enough credit for just how neat it is. It goes way beyond boozing and gambling. Hint: Check out the Neon Museum, Old Mormon Fort, and/or Nevada State Museum at Springs Preserve for a glance into Vegas history.

Vegas pretty much offers it all. It's big city amenities in a suburban neighborhood. And it's a valley surrounded by pretty mountains as a nice bonus. And, of course, there's the weather. Personally, I like the heat. So to me, Vegas is an awesome place to live as well as visit.

And seriously, if you are just visiting, take some time to get into the actual City of Las Vegas. You won't be disappointed. There's a whole world beyond the Strip and it's full of awesome things.",5
Local Flavor,"I have been to Vegas for fun and have been here for a contract for a year.  I am so thankful that in a few months I will be going back to my home state Colorado.  I work an IT and was asked to work on a project and my husband is a waiter so we figured why not try it.  From a tourists point of few this city is awesome... but smoke and mirrors.  The one thing we now realized is that we will not be able to come back to Vegas because we took a peak behind the Wizards cloak.  I can list the pros but unfortenitly that would only be as a visitor as a person who has lived here I can really only give the cons.

Cons:
Public transportation sucks.  Again we are from Denver and used to being able to rely on busses being on time.  Not here it is in deed at whatever pace the bus driver wants to get there and that is even if the bus ever shows up.

Be prepared to be asked by at least half the people you come across if you have a cigarette.  When we first arrived in Vegas we bought a carton of cigarettes and before we left the store the cashier advised us to put it away in a bag.  We both kinda just looked at each other.  Now we know why, we have seen people mugged for less.

I have never seen so many mobility scooters in our lives... we understand that there is a need but half the people that use them don't seem to need them just pure laziness.  

The job market is great if you work in the service industry.  Past that there isn't much.  Any job outside the strip is usually geared towards supporting a community that work for the strip.  What I mean by this is there are no ""corporate"" environments for work.  Like in Oklahoma you have the oil industry, Seattle and Portland has Tech and jobs off the dock... not really much going on here and afraid that if they didn't have the gaming industry then there would be nothing else.  Which is scary with how other states are starting to allow gambling.  

The weather is great most months but I really really missed my seasons this year.  I missed the rain, the snow, and man do I miss the grass... (I am from Denver but not that kind of grass).  Don't move here from Mid/End June to August.  It gets hella hot and I mean hot.  Give yourself some time before to acclimate before you get to those months.

The people.  People are cautious around here so most people are stand offish and it seems to deal with the part that it appears everybody is out for themselves or has some con game going.  The normal people around here aren't so normal.  I have seen people off the strip walking around in underwear to people beating the hell out of each other.  If you want to experience ""old"" Vegas head on over to Boulder Highway that is old in sooo many ways.

Last but not least we often wonder and theorize what effects the Nuclear testing has done to this area of the country.  We have travelled the US and many countries due to my work and we have never seen so many deformed people in our lives... so be cautious when you drink the water.

So we wished we never looked the Wizard and wish we would have been content in just following the yellow brick road.  Unfortunately we no longer believe in Santa, the Easter Bunny, and Vegas.",2
Local Flavor,"Really though. What's not to like about Vegas???

My sister moved out this way years ago to attend college and well.......she never returned. That speaks volumes!!! 

Traveling out here every other month or so, it's really secured itself as being more of a second home to me than a tourist attraction yet I'm seemingly awestruck each time I arrive and look around only to observe some type of new development or building undergoing rehab- construction.

A mere 4-5 hour drive (northeast along the 15 freeway) from Los Angeles, not to mention a sneeze of a 45 minute flight.....upon making it out, it's pretty easy to configure just how this place derived it's ""Sin City"" alias.

For the love of God.... WHAT ISN'T LEGAL HERE???????!

-  Gambling. Check.

-  Public Intoxication.  Check

-  Indoor Smoking.  Check.

-  Prostitution...... PENDING.

THIS PLACE HAS TRULY SECURED ITSELF AS BEING AN ADULT's VIRTUAL PARADISE. Yet the irony is that most of Las Vegas' locals aren't even from the town itself. This,...can be a good AND a bad thing.

Despite the ""Strip"" receiving all of the attention, what negative can be spoken on a constantly evolving place in the desert where millions of cultures can diversify and cohesively mesh? 

Most of the restaurants are open 24 hours a day and unlike the town's disgustingly expensive (overrated) neighbor, California..... gas prices here let alone food and housing are all the more affordable deeming this place all the more star worthy as I see it.

Of course the mantra ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"" tends to attract douchebags and loose women from everywhere. This can make for quite an interesting experience. My advice: PACK YOUR PEPPER SPRAY BEFORE HEADING OUT.

Add the beauty of the mountains and desert sunsets and there you have it: a desert oasis. I truly believe, no matter your age, creed, color, etc., there is TRULY something for everyone in Las Vegas. For those interested in raising a family, there are even ""kid friendly"" suburban-like locations ideal for just that.

The only con I can fathom would be the obvious..... HEAT. Thereon, it's the desert. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU EXPECT???! Stay the heck out of the kitchen unless you're prepared to get burned----",5
Local Flavor,"For my 500th review, I needed to write a review that will really be fun and reflect the atmosphere in my life currently.

Seeing that I just came back from Vegas 2 weeks ago and I'm about to head out again in 3 days, I knew that Sin City was just the one!

This upcoming trip will be my 4th visit to Vegas. I didn't think it would be a city that I would fall in love with, but it's really hard not to.

My first trip to Vegas was in 2013. I booked a trip because I was going to the Electric Daisy Carnival, also known as EDC, also known as bunch-of-'ravers'-wearing-tutus-and-getting-fucked-up-to-sellout-DJ's.  I didn't want my first trip to Vegas to only be about EDC, so Kyle H. and I booked a six day ALL VEGAS inclusive trip.

The first three days, we did classic Vegas. We drank all day and all night (and in public of course), we gambled our measly paychecks away, we ate at The Wynn Buffet (best vegan options!), we went to see Cirque Du Soleil (The Beatles Love!), we went to pool parties (Encore Beach Club), we walked the strip to see the Fountains of Bellagio & The Mirage Volcano.
The last three days, we partied until the sunrise at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, home of EDC.
Needless to say, we did not sleep much, our diet wasn't very...nutritious, and we were braindead by Day 6. Did I mention we also drove? Yeah...10 hour drive back to San Jose was not fun.

That Vegas trip was so crazy, it took me an entire year to recover. I went again the next year with a bunch of girlfriends. It was fun, but was full of drama. *Cue me sitting on a beach chair sipping my Mai Tai watching other girls duke it out* Vegas is apparently where reality show ideas must come from.

I went 2 weeks ago and we did a manageable 3 day trip and it was just so much fun.
In 3 days, I am proud and excited to announce that I will be one of the official performers/dancers for EDC 2015! I can't wait to be on stage with world class DJ's, dancing in front of thousands and thousands of people! It is a dream come true and ONLY Vegas can make it happen!

I love you Vegas...for your
-hot summer heat (Yes! I love it!)
-all day and night drinking (I'm an alcoholic!)
-amazing variety of shows to watch (Cirque Du Soleil can't be matched)
-pool parties
-gambling (don't want it in California, nice to have fun here)
-iconic Strip! (get a room with a view-always!)
-The empire that is Steve Wynn. (and his incredible vegan dining options!)
-constantly reinventing ideas. The Linq High Roller is just an incredible idea with breathtaking views!

I don't love you for your:
-traffic. ugh.
-disdain for 'car-share' programs like Lyft or Uber. The taxis here suck and are overpriced and need competition.
-overpriced drinks. $20 for well drinks...NOT ok!
-Prices being different for men vs. women. Even though it *technically* benefits me, I don't agree with it.
-pushy, lying club promoters. Ew.
-the continued narrowing focus on high end designs and ultra ritzy lifestyle. Old Vegas lifestyle is slowly being pushed out (RIP Riviera).
-your slot machines eating my money too fast. But I guess that's my fault for playing slot machines to begin with.

But those are small things that are mostly focused on money. Yes, Vegas is not cheap, but hey who said Vegas was suppose to be a budget vacation? I'm going to have fun, and fun I will have!

To anyone going to EDC, watch for me on the big stage! To everyone else, see you on the strip!
Or, you can just stay here on Yelp and read my Vegas reviews for the next few weeks. ;)

Happy 500th Review!",4
Local Flavor,"I think I may be done with Las Vegas and will start spending my vacation dollars else where. Vegas used to be fun, reasonably affordable, etc. but now it's turned into a horribly overpriced city where you have to be practically rich to have even a little bit of fun and the customer service nearly everywhere is awful. I have never had so many bad experiences one after another than I have had in Vegas on the same trip from all different places. The workers are so rude and are a major pain to deal with. Every place you visit there's always se sort of issue whether it's the MGM Grand cheating you out of your room and lying, or the Wynn risky denying you entry to the buffet because you have a tank top, or the Cosmopolitan promising you a special meal to make up for a bad experience and then flaking on it. I'm tired of paying so much money to go to Vegas and in return I get to deal with the rudest employees in the world.",1
Local Flavor,"So hot in summer you need to take enough water, but I would prefer the summer, because it is also hot in the evening and when the sun is gone it is warm and you can easily go to see the shows. More than the strip is for me not interesting in las vegas, but the strip you definitely need to see.",5
Local Flavor,"Empty soulless desert dirt box. This city has everything for sale and not much of actual value. The psychology that went into designing and executing this all consuming money trap is as impressive as it is pernicious. You can do everything under one roof if you like, everything except improve your humanity. If you have a soul or a brain I recommend never visiting this garbage city.",1
Local Flavor,"Las Vegas is the place where people leave all of their problems behind. Gambling, drinking, sex is what you're probably doing when visiting Vegas. Their motto ""What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"", Well not in my case. 

My father a good hard working man was a resident of N. Las Vegas for 8 years and was well known in the security alarm industry. On July 12, 2015 a reckless drunk driver going about 90 mph ran two red lights killing my father and a correctional officer. My father and the other innocent man was the 99th and 100th DUI killing in Vegas at that time. Several more innocent people have died due to drunk drivers since then. Do I think this review will change the law, No but I do want to shed light on this big problem that's going on.

After grieving the loss of my father I get a call from the DA (district attorney) telling me the man who was responsible for this was only going to get 8 years. Yes you heard me right 8 years for killing two people. I found out that's about as much time you get in Vegas for a DUI case. That's why it happens so often. It's a slap on the hand and Vegas residents know this. I shouldn't be too appalled since this is Party town USA but I do think if you guys are going to promote drinking except the consequences and make stiffer laws against the DUI drivers. It's so surreal watching the news and seeing my father's face on there knowing he died a horrible death. Multiple blunt force trauma is what they told me.  http://www.kptv.com/story/29538834/driver-in-5-vehicle-fatal-crash-booked-on-dui-charges

I feel there is injustice in my dads case especially since the guy who killed my father posted pics on his Facebook page of him drinking just hours before doing what he did and in just 8 years he can get out and do it all over again. Las Vegas you truly are the city of sin.",1

SITREP

From buffet-o-ramas and poolside service, to night-time clubbing and exotic shows, Las Vegas has it all!

THE SETUP

After highly monitored & controlled visits with my parents as a teen, I FINALLY got to hit Vegas on my own in 2003.

* VIVA LAS VEGAS!  When I hit my first Viva Las Vegas, these tend to center around the Gold Coast Hotel & Casino and The Orleans.  And this has been a continually great time for Rockabilly Bands & Swing-Dancing Fun, that keep coming back every couple/few years or so.

* CIRQUE DU SOLEIL!  Amazing themes, with eight (8) resident shows now, including Zumanity, O, Mystere, all fantastic!  I see they also have a show I have not caught yet:  Zarkana!  Looks like another trip to Vegas is coming up!  (Before year's ends?  We shall see!)

YSB 2012!

Yet I shan't forget Yelp Spring Break (YSB) 2012 - VEGAS!  This was the event that first put the wild 4-day Yelp Weekends on the map.  YSBs have now been in New Orleans (2013), Nashville (2014), Ft. Lauderdale (2015) and will be next year in San Diego (2016).  There's also been the Yelp 10-Year Anniversary 4-Day Weekend 2014.  And the wildly successful Yelp's Tahoe Getaway - Oct 2015.  

Yet I can not be forgotten that the 4-Day Weekend Yelp events started here in Vegas!

Local Flavor,Gotta love Vegas.  So much to do even if you don't gamble.  The streets can be a bit dirty but with some many tourists it would be hard to keep up maintenance.  The traffic does suck major.  They seem to be attempting to improve it however.  Can stop visiting this place.,4

It's Vegas baby!",5
Local Flavor,"Great place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live here. Besides downtown's Fremont Street Experience and the Strip, much of the city looks rundown and ugly. You have to drive a ways out into the suburbs to find nicer neighborhoods. But, if you only stay in the touristy areas, there is a lot of fun to be had, for both adults and families. I think of it less and less as ""Sin City"" with each visit. It's nice they got rid of the smut promoters slapping brochures into people's hands. Shopping has really exploded in this city from the many outlet malls to the high-end boutiques on the Strip. 
A few things I'd like to change..
-Hotel pool hours need to be more family friendly rather than closing so early.
-I wish they'd stop with the ever-rising ""resort fee"" BS at the hotels.
-I wish entertainment shows had family discounts.
-I miss the discounts and coupon books of the old days, RIP $3.99 prime rib & $0.99 shrimp cocktails, you will be missed always.",4
Local Flavor,"Canongate is the part of the Royal Mile (also known as High Street) that is below North Bridge. It's the quainter half, as far as I'm concerned, and the one that's least full of tourists, since the tourists are mostly concerned with seeing the Castle. 

Somehow, there is a fudge phenomenon on this part of the Mile. There are about a million we shops that hand out free samples. 

From the top of Canongate you can see the sea beyond Holyrood. Holyrood Palace is at the end of Canongate as is the Scottish Parliament.",5
Local Flavor,"My current place of work is on the Canongate, so it's perhaps testament to the area that despite it's association with the monotony of working life, it's still my favourite part of the Royal Mile.

Feeling a bit like a village high street in parts, there's a couple of charmingly old-fashioned museums, a great Turkish cafe, a few (almost) tourist free pubs, and a surprisingly quiet Starbucks which never runs out of the Apple Fritter Donuts I crave.",5
Local Flavor,"I really hate The Royal Mile. You know, because of all the tourists and stuff. Don't get me wrong, it's really really brilliant, but it's soooooo crowded all the time. Yet for some reason, the Canongate never seems to get like that. It winds down beautifully towards Holyrood Palace (well worth a visit), and it's got this lovely, kind of medieval feel to the it.

There's a plethora of shops, some good, some not so good. There's all the touristy crap, but then there's some really interesting stuff too. And best of all, the Scottish parliament is at the bottom, which you really really must visit. It sort of looks like something from Brave New World if it was designed by Fred Flintstone. Hilarious. But even if you don't go in anywhere, the Canongate is just a pleasant place to be, and gives you a real feel for the city.",5

Local Flavor,"South Queensferry is the picturesque seaside town which resides next to the Firth of Forth and between the two main bridges.

The most well known, and famous part of the town is the old town where the High Street winds its way through the many old buildings which originate from the seventeenth century. This part of the town is very popular with tourists. The town also has one of the best restaurants in Scotland in the form of Orocco pier. 

The town is also well known for its annual Ferry Fair, when the Burry man is paraded through the street (Sadly, I have not experienced this event which is apparently pagan in its origins). 

One of the most picturesque towns on the east coast of Scotland. Most defiantly worth a visit.",4

I enjoyed an afternoon of hanging out, taking pictures, and eating cake and coffee at South Queensferry. Overall, the village is nice and easy to navigate around. There's a museum, a places of interest map when you first enter, and there's a bus stop at the edge of the village as well. 

Obviously the bridges are why a lot of people stop by South Queensferry. The views of them are all great, with several places to sit -not including the pier. There is also a very old church and a plethora of places to eat, drink, and relax. 

On top of this, I found the local people to be very friendly and welcoming to me during my time there. That was a welcomed surprise, one that makes me want to come back again before my time in Edinburgh ends. 

South Queensferry, a wonderful little place to visit.",4
Local Flavor,"Go along, enjoy the town and its eateries, grab a boat tour or a slow walk along by the water, you won't be disappointed

Great biker cafe for all the motorbike fans out there located directly across from the lifeboat station",4
Restaurants,"They have tator tots!!! 

We have eaten a few times here and have never been disappointed. The Friday Fish Fry is incredible - tastes just like you are in Wisconsin. The apps are tasty too: Quesadilla, tato skins, and the lettuce wraps are the best! They have a fairly new menu that has quite a few healthier items. My hubby's favorite is the black bean burger. The portions are large but is there really such a thing as too many tator tots? The servers are so friendly as are the bartenders. You can eat outside or at the inside bar too. Great stuff.",5
Restaurants,"Picked this based on the two reviews. Its been 45 minutes since we saw our server. No appetizers yet. There are two servers and six tables. We have watched two orders go back to the chef, worried about our food. Food came, recommend burgers or sandwiches.",1
Restaurants,"Tried breakfast, lunch, and dinner here, and the food was terrible.  The only nice features are the friendly dinner staff and the nice golf course view during the day.  Since those two features can be easily obtained elsewhere, I would not recommend this place.

Breakfast- the eggs and sausages were fine, but the oatmeal was overcooked, and service was completely lacking despite the fact that the restaurant was not even half full.  

Steak salad- ordered the steak medium rare.  It came overly smoked, completely overcooked, and tasted like beef jerky.  The spinach was also not fresh.

Vegetable soup- tasted fine, but nothing special. 

Chicken Caesar- the dressing was fine, but the lettuce was somewhat blackened.  The chicken was also blackened and overcooked.  

Tater Tots- tasted fine, although a bit dry.  

Overall, this is at best a two star restaurant.",1
Restaurants,"Went with a friend last night and picked Tatum's because it was walking distance from her condo and we wanted a golf course view.  Sat on the patio and it was nice.  Ordered the french onion soup - bland, and the stuffed mushrooms which were good.   For our meal we ordered the prime rib sandwhich and the philly sandwich - one with tater tots and the other with cajun fries.  We send both our dishes back TWICE because the sandwiches were cold.  It was obvious that they just tried to microwave them because the meat came back very tough and leathery:-(  The waitress had the executive chef take care of it, in which when they came back the plates were hot as well as the food.  Both meals were just ok..I have had better sandwiches at Portillo's.  Fries and tots were nothing special - pretty sure the tots are frozen ones that they just microwave - hence the amount of ketchup needed to eat them.  Waitress was very nice through all of this.  My friend works at a restaurant and I grew up in the grocery and restaurant business - were we too critical?  No, Tatum's needs to work on their menu and their cooking.  Glad we did not order the pricey entrees.",2
Restaurants,"We were staying at Embassy Suites, anyway, so after a drink at their guest reception we decided to try their restaurant.  We were very happily surprised. Our server, Diane, was friendly and enthusiastic. We got the Margarita grilled sandwich, which was great. The chicken was smothered in a spicy cheese sauce that was also kind of sweet. Diane substituted a nice jicama slaw instead of fries. Our Zona Cobb salad was covered with Margarita chicken and avocado. It was both attractive and delicious.",4
Local Flavor,"I might be cheating by including this review. It's a stand-alone piece of art that a friend introduced me to last week, and I had never seen or heard of it. I was sad I'd never heard of it, as it's this big, beautiful masterwork right here in Charlotte.

So basically, it's a giant head. It spins kind of randomly, wildly. It's made of stainless steel, and it's beautiful. The giant head is also a fountain, but like a silky, smooth kind of fountain. It made me want to fall down on the ground and go to sleep, listening to the water, watching the freaky head spinning on its axis. 

I have no idea who made it or why it's standing in a corporate office complex. There's a decent Thai restaurant nearby, too, that I'll review another time. I think the Giant Head would be a great location for a picnic or outdoor date or afternoon nap, or whatever you want.",5
Local Flavor,"This big giant head is not - to my knowledge - the same as the one from Third Rock.  It does not, at least to my eye, look anything like William Shatner.  Though it is allegedly a fountain, it does not always have water running, which can probably make it look a bit different - a head in a pond is different than a head in a fountain, right?

What possessed Paychex (or whatever company before them) to put a monstrous, rotating metal head in front of the building, I will never know, but it is cool.  Even better is the fact that the head is made up of bunches of little platters.  Unfortunately, what looks like perhaps fifty tiny platters do not spin - only the larger ""bundles"" of platters (four or five of them).

This means that the forehead and the nose can be pointing in different directions at times.  It seems to happen - roughly - every fifteen minutes or so, and the head points generally in compass points in relation to the building behind it, but it does not necessarily go around those points, stopping at each in order (like dealing a deck of cards).

Instead, it seems to follow you.  We had an impromptu picnic, and the head pointed away from the building.  But when we were sitting on the steps, it turned to look at us, in a disjointed way.  Then we went to the side and it reconfigured (to its normal state) and looked in that direction.  Then we went back to the steps and it turned that way.  Eventually we got used to it, until we went to leave and the head turned and in its cross-plattered way, it turned to look at us, as if to ask us not to go.  That was a bit creepy.",5
Local Flavor,"One day, you're driving along Arrowood and then you spot, out of the corner of your eye, a glint...nay, a sparkle of gloriously metallic art. Standing proudly between office buildings in an innocuous office park. Holding ground firmly. A spectacle to be seen. Then....you drive closer. Drawn in by it's sheer oddity. BAM. It's a GIANT FREAKING HEAD. 

Now, for those of you with a running imagination, I say let it run. This thing is wonderful. Massive in scale. Easily 15 ft tall, reflecting all sources of light, resting atop a beautiful, flat fountain....and...it spins. It spins in different directions, in pieces, and somewhat at random. I'm not sure whether you call this art or a monument. 

Visit during the night hours to see it stoically standing guard before the Paychex building. The calm water of the fountain dribbles over the edge and makes a calming sound as the giant eyes stare off into the night sky. If you've ever seen large statues, seen movies like Prometheus or Lord of the Rings, or just have a wandering imagination, like me, you'll find this little dose of local flavor worth the drive. 

Take pictures! Cheers!",5
Local Flavor,"My darling and random husband told me one night at 10pm, ""Honey, go put your shoes on. We're going to have an adventure."" I was clueless about where we might be going, and all the better.

I should preface this review by mentioning that I have an unhealthy obsession for obscenely large items (cue laughter and ridicule). I stalk websites about the Ryugyong Hotel, spend unholy amounts of time contemplating the possibilities of tsunamis sweeping me from my apartment to my doom...in Charlotte, and frequently gasp when I see empty swimming pools, coliseums or stadiums. I'm a strange one.

So anyway, Ben drove us out to an office park, and my hopes of adventure were waning. Seriously, who has adventures in office parks? But then he turned into a parking lot and LO AND BEHOLD THERE WAS A GIANT METAL HEAD!

I was deliriously excited! So happy! (Also a little freaked out, heart palpitations, and instant imaginations of a giant metal body resting beneath the earth...)

Simultaneously whimsy-inducing and terrifying, we walked up to the glistening, enormous work of art and marveled at its construction, location and....just wondered why it was there.

As Westley would say, ""I've never seen its equal."" And really, I haven't. I'm itching to get back there and feed my hunger for the oversized and just plain weird.",5
Local Flavor,"I was told there would be a giant metal head. There was no giant metal head. 

If you are expecting to see a giant, metal head, than go elsewhere for your giant metal head needs.

Metalmorphosis does not deliver. It has been taken down.",1
Local Flavor,"The legend is true. There is a big giant head in Charlotte. With water spitting out of the mouth into an overflowing pool, it stands before you. Why it's there, nobody knows. While it doesn't spin like one of the legends may lead you to believe, the head is back after an apparent hiatus. i assume it returned to its alien planet to report all the boring observations made inside of the random business park where he resides. This would be a 5 star attraction if it were located anywhere with even a remotely interesting attraction nearby. It would be really cool uptown or maybe in Freedom Park. Why? It's just a head, you say. It's a marvelous head and i'm glad after months of asking, the wife finally agreed to stop by and see it with me. 
It's an easy 3 minute detour off of 485 on Arrowwood. So, if you're passing through, stop and check it out. If you feel so inclined to make a trip to see it, bring a lunch and sit in judgement from both the Giant Head and the eyes from the surrounding business windows.",4
Local Flavor,"I don't know what it is about the big giant head, but I love it.  (say it, go ahead.... that's what she said!)

I moved to Charlotte last year, and this has been one of the silliest most random things that I love about Charlotte.  Yes, it sits in the middle of a business park.  Yes, it's ridiculously large (there's another one, go ahead...).  Is it worth the 5 min detour off of 485?  Absolutely.  When I moved last April, I heard that it was broken.  It didn't spin, it didn't spit, it just sat there.  Still interesting all the same.  But I went in July 2013 with a friend of mine, and Metalmorphosis learned how to spit!  He doesn't do anything else, but he does spit!  I always take my visitors here, who doesn't love a good random adventure that doesn't detour your plans at all??",5
Local Flavor,"Very cool art in the middle of a corporate park. 
My brother in Spain saw an article about it and was surprised I had never heard of it. We went to see it and while it doesn't move and there was no water coming out, it still is super cool!",5
Local Flavor,Sure it is a giant metal head on an infinity pool.  Don't drive fifty miles out of the way but it is worth a detour.  On a sunny day it almost seems like it not really there.  It was not moving when I stopped by this time.  I hope that is not permanent.   That is a huge part of it.,4
Local Flavor,It is good place to visit if you are near to this place or if you are driving through this place.very good and peaceful location.can easily spend 1 hour of evening time here peacefully.,4
Local Flavor,"I will echo the comments of everyone else. This was a pretty cool statue in the middle of an industrial park, although it technically is a fountain. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it but if you are in the area it's worth the stop.",4
Local Flavor,Took a foreign friend who is obsessed with all things metal here and he loved it (as did I). It's peaceful and worth a visit to add to your collection of memorable photos.,5
Local Flavor,"There currently is no Big Giant Head to behold.  They have taken it down.  The live feed camera monitoring was disabled some time ago and now there is nothing there except the base.  I adore this art piece and hope it will eventually return.  According to Donna Ashcraft-Pressley, Marketing Director for AAC, the giant kinetic sculpture had ""some issues that need to be repaired by the artist, David Černý, who lives in Prague."" She goes on to explain that ""it is a very complicated mechanism and the artist is working hard on solving the problem.""  UPDATE:  Repairs have been made and Metalmorphosis has returned!",5
Local Flavor,"On our way out of town we decided to stop and see this sight! It was a Sunday around 1 when we arrived. Sadly no water and no movement. However a kind family that were locals of Charlotte informed us that he spins and lights up with water AT NIGHT. So now we know, night is when the metal man comes alive! He was still a sight to see and pretty cool to snap some photos of but if you want the real show, make sure to stop by in the evening when he comes to life. :)",4
Local Flavor,A very unique fountain!  I agree an industrial park isn't the best place to display this artful fountain but it does cut down on crowds!! The fountain was fully functional on our visit!  If you're in the area it's worth stopping by for a photo op!,5
Local Flavor,"When we went to see this mirrored water fountain by Czech sculptor David Černý, randomly located in the middle of a cool water installation itself amidst a new industrial park complex, it was neither working nor fully assembled, but was still impressive and a great unique photo opp.

Would like to see it in its full glory, however. Maybe on a subsequent visit to the Queen City!",3
Local Flavor,"If you are in the area or looking for a cool place for a photo shoot, Metalmorphosis is certainly worth a visit. Even better if your looking to stop by on a Wednesday since it offers lunch! About 1/2 dozen food trucks park around it from 10am-2pm every Wednesday and the food options change weekly.

Metalmorphosis was conceived by Count Arco, Chairman of the company that owns the Whitehall Corporate Center. The Count contracted Czech Sculptor, David Cerny to create the one-of-a-kind sculpture and it is magnificent.

One last tip though, it's not a wishing well so you may want to keep your coins in your pocket or buy a taco.",5
Local Flavor,"The statue is great and a good photo opportunity. Unfortunately, it is located in a business park area and there nothing else around as far as attractions for tourists. If you visit, expect to see only Metalmorphosis. The day I was there the fountain part of the statue was turned off, so he was not spitting, but that did not detract from my enjoyment of the piece of art.",3
Local Flavor,"So cool!!  After a few minutes, it changes sequences and the pattern at which the face comes together. The area is nice as well. A great in a business complex. 
Worth the 20min drive.",5
Local Flavor,"What can you say about a 14 ton rotating head in the middle of a fountain that acts as the ""welcoming committee"" to an office building in a commercial office park in Southwest Charlotte? I can say that in all my travels, I've never seen anything like this. Not just the gigantic head. But a ROTATING gigantic head.

David Černý, the Czech sculptor of this interesting piece. It's not political. It really doesn't make a statement other than ""Wow, this is unique."" Forty steel pieces that rotate 360 degrees. I found out later that it's supposed to ""spit"" water into the fountain, but that feature wasn't operating today.

It is interesting, that's for darned sure. If you're driving 485 near the outlet mall, it's not much out of your way to stop by and check out.

Cue Austin Powers. ""He'll never be the head of a major corporation.""",4
Local Flavor,"Cool spot for a cool view of one of the most unique moving metal sculptures in this area.

It was a quick stop for the kids and I that turned into a play in the water moment on a very hot day. I thought the sculpture is supposed to spit out water but perhaps it was turned off/broken when we visited as it did not happen.",5

Local Flavor,"This place is so beautiful.  I found this particular park by happenstance as I was lost.  Talk about a secret.  Not only is the design of the park beautiful, but the view of the South Side, North Side, and Downtown is just spectacular.  

I would have to say this is one of the best parks, if not the best, in Pittsburgh.",5
Local Flavor,"Gorgeous park.  AMAZING view.  I believe the view from this park is better than Mount Washington.  It's less crowded, plentiful parking and well.. the pictures speak for themselves!  MUST SEE.",5
Local Flavor,"One of my favorite views of Pittsburgh, and a great place to watch the fireworks on the 4th of July!",5
Local Flavor,"I learned about this place from DH while we started dating.   He had dared to show me something beautiful about Pittsburgh that I had never seen before on our second date.  I didn't think it was possible since he wasn't a Pittsburgh native.  Apparently most Pittsburgh natives don't know about this place - how sad!  I was blow away by the view.  In my opinion it's much better than Mount Washington, and it's now a place we regularly take our guests to see.",5
Local Flavor,"For the iconic view of the Golden Triangle, this is where you want to go. All three rivers, the fountain, and Point State Park are all visible.  Great spot for fireworks too",4
Local Flavor,"I truly believe this one is better than the Mt Washington. Although Mt Washington has a good view (not as good of course), it's more of a tourist location feel. At West End, it's more of a quiet park with a more breathtaking view of the perfect golden triangle. We stood there for 5 minutes speechless and then hung out for about 45 minutes-- in the cold. We loved it and can't wait to head there for summer time. I'll upload my amazing pictures after work ;)",5
Local Flavor,"It's not as famous as Mt. Washington, and you don't get to ride the Inclines up here. But the view of downtown is expansive, and the neighborhood is charming. We spent July 4 evening here mingling with the park's friendly, chatty, neighbors, their kids and dogs in tow. Also more than a few photographers with their tripods and giant DSLRs, who were also happy to trade tips on how to shoot fireworks. 

Fireworks tip: get here a couple hours early to stake out a good spot!",4
Local Flavor,"Great view of the Pittsburgh fireworks!  We got there about 8:30p and were able to find parking close by and stake out a place on the grass.  Others had arrived earlier and had ""front row"" view from the fence surrounding the park.  Pittsburgh Channel 11 was there to film the show also due to the fantastic view.  The anticipated crowds were not bad at all and traffic was reasonable on the way out.  I will be back!!",4
Local Flavor,The best place to get a great scenic view of the city of Pittsburgh.  A hidden gem that should be a must for tourists to Pittsburgh.  The head on view of Pittsburgh beats the view that you get from Mount Washington.,5
Local Flavor,"This truly is a great place to view the 4th of July Fireworks.  Great view, not too many people, security, and live music.",5
Local Flavor,"This is, simply put, the absolute best view of Pittsburgh. The park itself, while small, is clean and comfortable for a quick visit or a relaxed weekend picnic. Yes, walking along Grandview Avenue or stopping for a photo on the overhang is also fantastic but spending time in the West End - Elliott Overlook park proves to be a more rewarding experience overall.",5
Local Flavor,An amazing place to see the city. Lived here for so long and never knew about this hidden gem. Definitely a place to visit.,5
Local Flavor,So recommended and if you dont want to spend more money at Mt. Washington then this is the place! :),4
Local Flavor,"As a native Pittsburgher, I've known about the West End Overlook but somehow it has taken me almost 40 years to get there and admire the view.  I decided one chilly spring morning to wake up early and drive over to take in the sunrise.  

The park itself is small but clean, wouldn't be a bad meeting place for a picnic when the weather is warmer.  It's also relatively easy to find and there's even a parking lot.  

What really makes this a 5 star location is that view.  From the West End Overlook, you get a head on picture of the city from the point where the three rivers meet.  The sound of traffic zooming across the bridges is dulled only by the chirping of the birds as the day begins.  

Watching the sun rise over the hill and shine on our fair city was one of the most majestic scenes.  And even though I've lived in Pittsburgh my entire life and viewed the city from several different angles, I think this might now be my favorite.  I can't wait to take my out-of-town guests here and show it off.",5
Restaurants,"My friends and I went to Sandey's Broaster Chicken on 1155 S Higley in Mesa, AZ. As loyal customers we are highly disappointed in the change. They have added an Indian Buffet to the restaurant. The macaroni and cheese was not cheesy but tasted like flour and was soupy. The cole slaw had an after taste to it like it had not been properly covered in the refrigerator at night and absorbed the odor of other foods. After leaving the restaurant the smell of the Indian curry lingered in our nostrils and attached to our clothing. Unfortunately, we will now have to find a new Broaster Chicken restaurant. We will not be going back.",1
Restaurants,"I would really encourage Nancy to give this place a try again, it appears that Sandey's itself is under new management and has gotten rid of the Indian food in favor of BBQ as a kicker.

I decided to try the 4 Piece chicken dinner, and was pleasantly surprised. While I waited for my dinner to be ready, I noticed another gentleman order some BBQ (I believe Tri-tip) that looked quite good and I believe I will stop in for that in the near future.

As for my meal, I was really impressed with the quality of the chicken. The breast was really juicy and tender, and the dark pieces, while smaller than what you might expect, were exceptional. The size of the dark pieces really speaks to quality chicken, in my opinion - the way chicken is actually supposed to be. The sides were good but not memorable, though I only tried the corn on the cob and the broasted potatoes. The potatoes were a smaller order than I expected, and I'll probably be giving the baked beans and mac and cheese a try next time.

The venue itself isn't much to look at, but the pricing is quite good for the fried chicken and defiantly something I would give a second try, as well as encourage my friends and family to visit.",3

It was destined to be a hot spot - after all, it was opened by a local star chef and situated in an obscure location.

But, something happened since Le Hangar opened. At the end of March 2012, bowed out of both Le Local and Le Hangar. I had been to Le Hangar when it opened - it was delicious, the service was friendly and the atmosphere was fun. Now, how would the restaurant fare without the local star chef? 

As we walked in, a cheerful (and ridiculously good-looking) host brought us to our table. Having seen the menu online and dreaming of a delicious meal after a hectic day at work in the marketing world, my friend and I knew exactly what we wanted to order.

We started with the fried mini-shrimp, herb butter, garlic and pecorino ($12). It was fun! Not particularly inventive, but the batter was great and the shrimp weren't overly dunked. The butter and garlic were a nice touch, and the cheese added a bit of a punch.

My friend had the mac & cheese with lobster and mushrooms ($20). It was really great. The pasta was cooked al dente, the sauce was tasty and there was actually a decent amount of lobster in there. Very well done.

I had the halibut with a pistachio-pesto crust, oyster mushrooms, and bouillon, topped with grapes and greens ($30). A surprising flavor at first, but it was tasty. I enjoyed it - the ingredients meshed surprisingly well together - but wished I could have tasted more of the fish among all of the ingredients.

The desserts, well... If you read my blog relatively regularly you know that few places impress me with their desserts (400 Coups and Pastaga deserve a special mention here, their desserts are flawless). Le Hangar falls into that category. The desserts were seemingly inexpensive, so we ordered two thinking that the portions would be small. Wrong! While I appreciate bang-for-buck, there's a lot to say about keeping desserts classy. It's easy to make them big, overly sweet and generally crude. It's much harder to make it the right size with a delicate sweetness and classy feel. The tiramisu sundae ($7) was an interesting idea, but should such a delicious classic be tampered with? Made with shortbread cookies, it was ok, but too heavy. The torta Caprese was also just ok, although the accompanying praline ice-cream (6$) was delicious.

But one thing left me particularly disappointed: the service. Yes, the courses were timely, but we had three different waiters throughout the evening. That's strange. Usually, a table is served by one waiter and a pleasant rapport usually develops throughout the evening... None of that at Le Hangar. Also, professionalism is important, but not when it comes at the price of friendly and personable service. Would it kill you to smile? Like, maybe a little bit? Anything!? Yes, apparently, it would.

This was the second time I went to Le Hangar, and I have to say, I enjoyed my first experience more. Has the reputation of a difficult reservation gone to the staff's heads? Possibly. Is it because of François Louis Marcotte's departure? Maybe. Either way, enjoying a meal has as much to do with the feel of the experience as it does with the food. So perk up guys, and drop the ""cool"" vibe. You have something good going. And based on my first experience, it could be really great.

I come here for the steak special that they serve here 24/7 for only $5.99.  You can get it breakfast style with eggs, hash browns and toast or pancakes, or dinner style with steamed and seasoned veggies, your choice of baked potato, mash, French fries or rice pilaf and a bread roll. The steamed veggies are never the same everyday so if you're picky about certain vegetables I would ask what they have that day.  The steak is good enough to eat with it's own juices and you don't really need A-1, but there's just alot of ligaments. =\

As for the service, they're really attentive and take care of you real well.  The other night we had Jermaine, he's a cool guy brings out everything quick and keeps the drink filled at all times.  It's pretty empty most of the time I go but I kinda like that.",4
Restaurants,"I guess it's been awhile since a review has been done. This is kind of a mixed review, overall not encourging. Went for their steak special $5.99. Place was not crowded 3/4 tables, 2 servers one about to get off. You more or less seat yourself. Server was quick w/ drink order and what I wanted. She offered a dinner salad ($1.99 extra). Waited and waited for salad, never appear. She did manage the salad for the couple seated after me. When my order came I queried her about the salad..she was the perfect ""blond""..she giggled and said ""my bad"" I forgot..really. Asked if I wanted now I said no. The meal..Baked potato must of been cooked early in the morning..inside of the potato was dark brown. veggies luke warm and the steak..hey it's $5.99 you be the judge small, grissled..but it was cooked med rare. Maybe it was a bad night, don't know, but will reconsider in the future....If your looking for a low cost steak dinner, try 
""The Pub""..much better...so on food  1 and for service -5. You know not once did she even offer to re-fill my ice tea...which really pissed me off.",1
Restaurants,"I like comin here for the Steak special. You can order it as a dinner or breakfast, 24 hours. With the dinner, I got the baked potato. The prompt waiter offered cheese, bacon, chives, and sour cream. I said sure..why not. Just watch out for the extra fees ie. cheese, bacon, chives and sour cream. :/
The potato needed all those toppings. So the extra fees was ALMOST worth it. I also had the salad. It was worth the $2. But not worth more then that. The steak wasn't bad. I ordered it med. rare. 
Dinner came with bread. Which was warm and soft. So all in all my $6 steak came out to be over $10. Next time, I'll just order it with the mashed potatoes. 
I had no problem with the service or the server. $4 house bloody mary was strong. 
I'll be going back :)

Restaurants,"While its a very small cafeteria (almost a cafe), the food here is excellent.  Recently had 10 meals here due to a friend in the hospital.  The staff is friendly, and its never too crowded.  Food has good variety (they change the menu every day), but given its size, its usually a limited selection.  BEST FOOD IN A HOSPITAL CAFETERIA I have ever been to!",4

Local Flavor,"Le boulevard St-Laurent est l'axe le plus important de Montréal, celui à partir duquel on se repère sur un plan. Par exemple quand on vous donne l'adresse suivante : 55 rue Ste-Catherine EST, cela va dire que c'est le numéro 55 à l'est de St-Laurent. De même le 55 OUEST de Ste-Catherine se trouvera à l'exact opposé, à l'ouest de St-Laurent donc. C'est bête mais si on ne vous précise pas ça avant votre arrivée à Montréal vous pouvez très facilement vous retrouvez très, très loin de votre destination : à l'exact opposé en fait! 
Cette situation centrale vaut au boulevard le nom francophone de La Main qui assez ironiquement vient de l'Anglais Main Street. Il y a d'ailleurs très régulièrement la fête de la Main, une sorte de marché un peu festif durant lequel le boulevard est rendu aux piétons entre Mont-Royal et Sherbrooke. Vous pouvez y aller pour l'ambiance et les petits shows qui sont organisés de-ci de-là, mais n'y allez pas spécialement pour du shopping : ce sont exactement les mêmes magasins que d'habitude, AUX MÊMES PRIX QUE D'HABITUDE, mais avec la foule de curieux en plus, donc vraiment pas l'idéal pour magasiner. Sauf si bien sûr vous raffolez à ce point des bains de foules...
Autre détail intéressant, La Main a longtemps été considéré comme la ligne de démarcation entre le Montréal anglophone (à l'Est) et le Montréal francophone (à l'Ouest donc). C'est toujours en partie vrai, même si cette frontière tend de plus en plus à disparaître.
Enfin, le boulevard et ses nombreuses petites boutiques de  mode sera parfait pour les Fashionista qui souhaiteront trouver une alternative aux grosses enseignes de la rue Ste-Catherine.",5
Local Flavor,"How cool is it that a section of the street is consistently closed to cars and vehicle traffic? The section of Saint Laurent Boulevard (also known as ""the Main"") in Montreal is the street food loving, patio chilling, bargain shopping sidewalk sales (or ventes trottoirs) heaven. 

When the weather in June is still raining and cold in Vancouver, it is sunny and very much summer in Montreal. Take the Metro to nearby stations of either Station Sherbrooke, Station Berri-UQAM, or Station Mont-Royal. A few minutes walk will land you on the street where beers are cheap and patios abound. I truly love how Montreal embraces patio life. Even random streets in the Finance district will land you a sexy open table with some delicious Sangria!

Even if you are parched from the sun you can option to sit inside the bar while people watching.

Meat galore - Hungarian sausages, sauerkraut

Visit the ever so busy Schwartz's Montreal Hebrew Delicatessen. They have some killer smoked meat that are super tender and juicy!

If eating isn't your thing, there are plenty of tees on sale and questionable dog grooming for your entertainment! 

After all this, maybe it`s time to head back to the hotel for a power nap or visit the beautiful McGill University.",4
Local Flavor,"The Main is closed for one weekend in June and one weekend in August for a great big street fest where the retail shops on the strip sell last seasons goods at crazy discounts. There are some stylish things, and some insane looking things like neon macrame dress shirts for men! Every bar and restaurant on the strip extends a patio onto the street, and most locals start on the pitchers in the sun early so as to maximize crazy people watching time. The area around Prince Arthur gets really crowded and clubby. Up around Rachel it's a little easier to breathe, and you are more likely to see those Chilean guys with the pan pipes, or that little girl who defies all child labour laws by slaying on the accordion for hours in the sun. (Who are your parents!!?) 

In general, the Main is what it sounds like; kinda the main drag. A little piece of it's heart died when the monuments and gravestones yard that used to haunt the heart of it was shut down, but as it stretches further and further north it keeps sprouting out new life and new hopes for business owners and remains one of the classic spots for late night roving, bike rides, and shot walks.",4
Local Flavor,"There is a street in this town where you can find anything. It's very similar to magician's black hat - you can pull white rabbit from there, or bouquet of flowers. That hat...errr... Boulevard... is named St. Laurent.

At day time, you will find small boutiques, coffee shops, banks and delis opening their doors. 
You can go into small yards in zigzag fashion and admire street art. I can truly say it has one of the best urban graffiti art collection I've seen. 
You can stop at every historical building line and gawk at sidewalk plaques that tell you dates they were built or rebuilt.
At night, it lights up with funky pole signs and restaurants windows. Bars with hidden doors and iron clad bouncers guarding them. Burlesque clubs and English pubs tempting you with dances and drinks.

and all the repairs throughout the year makes this a very bad street to be stuck on, cars or bus.

anyway, the main becomes something to behold late night on those summer days. its definitely more interesting than ste-catherine, that's for sure.",3

Public Services & Government,"If you want to start a business and file for a LLC, this is where you need to go if you want to expedite your paperwork.  When you file for a LLC you can either send it in via snail mail or come here for expedited service, which costs more money.  Nevada is a great state to incorporate.....there are so many favorable laws for corporations here, I'm surprised there aren't more people setting up businesses in our state.

The office is located on the 5th Floor of the Grant Sawyer Building.  The office is small and can get very busy.  You wait in a line until they call you up to the counter.  In order to save you some time, be sure to complete your paperwork BEFORE you come here.....I've seen people wait in line for 10-15 min only to be given paperwork to fill out and then told to wait in the line again.  Be prepared people!

Once you get to the counter the service is pretty quick.  You pay your fee(s), get your receipt, and you're done.  Very efficient.

Public Services & Government,"As far as government buildings go this place is actually quite nice. It is not hard to find and the parking lot is large. A big plus is, you do not have to meter, which I was afraid I was going to have to do. The structure itself is fairly modern, the inside is cavernous and minimal in design. There's a few different entrances so if you go in one entrance you may end up in a hallway of doom and not know where you are at all (this happened to me).

Fortunately the security guard was more than happy to direct me to where I was headed and even walked me halfway down a few of the winding hallways so I wouldn't get lost.

I came here for an assessment for a job. I'm not sure what else goes on in here, but if for some reason you have business to do here, at least it is a clean, well-kept building, and there is no security to go through either, so that's a plus.",5

Local Flavor,"Alright, alright!  

Please do not berate me because I took a day & a night off away from hanging with my Mom and her birthday week celebrations in Las Vegas.  I needed to snoop around and see how much the City of Las Vegas and Las Vegas Strip has changed since I last visited in the early 90's.

I just had to snoop from hotel to hotel, shop to shop, restaurant to restaurant, housing accommodations, colleges, etc. clerking locals working and living on the Strip, Las Vegas Locals living way far away from the Strip in the Burbs to see what was up with the Strip, Las Vegas' real estate market and Las Vegas' economic index!

Please take a peek at what I saw via taking pics via my Nokia 6260 camera phone.  I discovered two ends of the living spectrum which I found to be quite stark in contrast:

A lot of the Strip and the City of Las Vegas went through major gentrification, especially this living center plaza being built between Bellagio and NY, NY.  I discovered by talking to the building contruction manager in charge of the newly under-construction living center plaza that one studio apartment will run over $1 million!  What???   Who in their right minds will be so crazy to buy a 500 sq. ft. heinously small piece of real estate for $1 million??

Must be the Fig Newton family can afford this real estate fortune!  Sheesh!  I can imagine that any property on the Strip is like $2,000 per square foot!  Anyway, I walked away kinda miffed at the real estate prices on the Strip!  The Las Vegas and surrounding housing market away from the Strip is anywhere from the $200's all the way up to astronomically, ridiculously high real estate prices!

Alas, the Strip proved to be a major tourist trap magnet.  Each establishment I visited, it was like shoving yourself into a can of sardines!  It was awfully crowded everywhere I went even after 2 AM, this includes the Tram ride from Mandalay to Luxor!  

Way down on the other side of town on Tropicana Boulevard more than 5 miles away from the Strip is what I consider as the depressed, barrio area of Las Vegas . . . the un-touristy side of Las Vegas long forgotten.  You'll find the 99 Cent Store, Big Lots, UNLV, The BURBS, ROSS, Local Shopping Centers, all sorts of weird bank names, including the big banks heading towards a non-descript golf course nearby, Nellis AFB and beyond.

You'll meander through Sierra and Maryland Parkway into Asian, Indian, Mexican shops and neighborhoods.  You'll find pawn shops off the Strip and Tropicana for desperate souls who cannot control their gambling curse.

BTW-WARNING:  Please do not eat at this terrible restaurant called Nana ____ on Maryland Parkway-the food SUCKED!!!  Please look at the pic I took of this place and please make a mental note NOT to eat at this restaurant!

I guess so many of you are familiar having seen so many depressed neighborhoods in your lives, so Las Vegas is not immune to seeing a lot of depressing neighborhoods.  There are a lot of strange places off the Strip where casinos are grappling for tourists to frequent their gambling digs with two for one coupons and entertainment come-on gimmicks.  

I am referring to the old side of Las Vegas called, Fremont Street.  On Fremont Street, more gentrification has been under way for some time.  Sadly, Fremont Street seems to be attempting to compete with the Las Vegas Strip, vying desperately to entice the tourism trade to Fremont Street.  

Consequently, Fremont Street has quite a lot of work and a massive connundrum cut out for this depressed area because this area of Las Vegas is rapidly trying to erase and diminish the surrounding depressed areas making Fremont Street area more tourist attractive.

A stark realization must be truly admitted that Fremont Street will never be able to compete with the Strip due to the drastic contrast economically, especially with the depressed neighborhoods which surrounds Fremont Street, especially when The Las Vegas Convention Center is nearby.

Conflicting scenery off Fremont Street are homes and old apartment complexes I saw that had an A/C unit on top of their roofs, unlike the A/C units you find installed next to a person's home.  I rarely noted solar panels on people's homes and at all casinos.  Why are these homes and businesses taking advantage of the Sun's solar rays?????  

The heat in Las Vegas is unbearable at times, so it is safe to assume every person has their air conditioner on!  What's worse, should their be a severe drought, the water supply is quite sketchy and unreliable at best.

Needless to say, I will never buy property in Las Vegas because as I see it, Las Vegas is merely a service-oriented town catering to the rich who visit the Strip spending their billions all the while the lower to middle-class are working the Strip to make ends meet servicing the rich.

This economic contrast is too stark of a continental divide I cannot tolerate seeing on a day-to-day basis.",2
Local Flavor,"The world famous Las Vegas Strip......it's legendary.  If you haven't heard of it, you must have been in a coma for the past 30 yrs or from outer space.

How would I describe it?

- Alive.

- Over the top.

- Exciting.

- Crowded.

- Legendary.

The Las Vegas Strip is the only place in the world where you can find a wide variety of World Class Shopping, Chefs, Entertainers, Nightclubs, Hotels & Casinos mixed in with low priced entertainment options.....all within a 3 mile strip of road.  You can't find that in any other city in the world.

I think those of us who live here take it for granted....

Return Factor - 100%",5
Local Flavor,"Ah, the Strip.

Honestly, I would give our most famous landmark a 3.5 review, but I round it up to a ""4"" largely for the fine dining experiences, quality shows, and my own favorable personable experiences on the Strip.

It's the city's most popular spot, and for many visitors, when they come to Las Vegas, this is all the city consists of in their mind.  A virtual playground to gamble, drink, party, see and be seen....  And the most distinguishing sights are the casinos themselves.  The Strip has seen more action in terms of change recently, and not all of it is for the best.  Things get torn down, and nothing takes the place of it whether due to poor economy or poor lack of foresight.

But there are three styles of casinos on the Strip: Vintage, Theme and Museum.

Vintage - Back in the days, the Strip used to be a desert oasis, where people came out to the middle of nowhere to gamble.  In time, the Strip grew, and most of its ""legend"" was built during this time: The Rat Pack, Elvis, the Beatles, Liberace, Howard Hughes, Bugsy Siegel and other notorious mobsters, watching the atomic bomb as an actual entertainment show....  What made Vegas cool and unique was built during this time.  But as time moves forward, Vegas is notorious for forgetting and showing respect to its history.  These days, the old places are gleefully destroyed in a quick and dirty show of callous enthusiasm, with the Sahara falling victim to the next round of writing off a piece of what made Vegas great.  Granted, there are a lot of people who can't fathom the importance of any place that's older than five years and doesn't have a Cirque show in it, but in a city barely 100 years old, you have to take what's there.  Vintage started incorporating the next phase into it, such as the Hilton having (now closed) the Star Trek Experience, and even Sahara having a rollercoaster.

Theme - Vegas went through a ""family"" phase with places looking like enchanted castles, elaborate pirate battles, the feelings of walking through the streets of Paris or Rome, exploding volcanoes, Egyptian pyramids, gondola rides, and giant shark aquariums.  If there ever was a ""Disneyland for Adults"", the Strip exemplified it.  These casinos redefined the Strip's skyline, making it unlike any other place in such a short car ride.  One could virtually tour the world in a weekend (once the hangover faded), and made for great memories.  The ""Theme"" has been going away in more recent years.  Excalibur's wizard is replaced by a garish Dick's Last Resort sign, and is somewhat gutted.  Luxor is especially gutted, with the casino removing all Egyptian elements, forgetting that their entire place is built as a giant pyramid.  The MGM once had a theme park.  Treasure Island is now the too hip to say it all ""TI"", replacing their pirate battles with a gaudy T & A show.  But that goes into the recent phase....

Museum - Expensive, elaborate, not designed for the ""normal"" tourist anymore.  These places are designed without theme, making them look like any other skyscraper in any other city, and the insides, while beautiful, give the air of a museum, where one should ""look but not touch"".  This was designed for the next generation of clientele, getting rid of the families and middle income visitors.  The problem is, the economy took a huge dump in the last few years, meaning that projects never get finished, and the Vintage places that have been destroyed, and Theme areas that have been cleared out for ""the next big thing"", remain vacant lots, or incomplete skeletons.  The insides are indeed beautiful, but lack the fun and personality of the old days.  It's all become one giant display.

Regardless of these changes, I have personally built numerous wonderful memories on the Strip with both old and new.  While the old is continuously on the ""endangered species list"", there are still enough places to visit and enjoy for now.  The meals here are buffet wonderlands or from some of the best chefs around.  And the shows are generally top notch, even some of the not expected shows that don't have those huge marquees.

It's hard to say where the Strip will be 10 years from now, but it is always a creature of change, and whenever those brave, adventurous souls decide to venture onto this four mile area, they will find experiences like no other place around.",4
Local Flavor,"Interestingly enough, Wikipedia explains that ""The Nevada Gaming Commission defines the Strip gaming area as encompassing all resorts located on Las Vegas Boulevard South between Russell Road and Sahara Avenue, as well as several nearby properties not directly located on Las Vegas Boulevard. This includes The Rio, The Palms, and several other smaller resorts west of Las Vegas Boulevard and Interstate 15, but does not include The Orleans one block further west. Properties located east of Las Vegas Boulevard on Paradise Road, such as the Las Vegas Hilton, Terrible's Casino, Westin Casuarina Las Vegas Hotel, Casino & Spa, Hooters Casino Hotel, and the Hard Rock, are also included in this area. The Stratosphere, however, is not included in the Nevada Gaming Commission's definition of the Strip since it lies north of Sahara Avenue on Las Vegas Boulevard.""

What already hasn't been said about the Strip?  This glorious 4.2 mile strip of real estate stretching from Sahara Ave. to Russell Rd. is a virtual amalgamation of elaborate and often gaudy hotels (and people) showing off their excesses.  

In 90 degree plus heat, I traversed the crowded pathways and footbridges searching entertainment and finding it in so many forms:  

The hustling street performers rustically dressed as Transformers, Hello Kitty, painted mimes, Disney and anime/manga characters getting the crowds to pose with them for tips.  How they're able to survive in those sometimes heavy costumes in summer heat is beyond comprehension.  

The Asian acrobats in leotards Cirque du Soleil-ing one another with blaring boom boxes hoping to persuade gawkers to donate part of their winnings into overturned hats and rusty cans.  

But it was the crowds themselves that were the most entertaining of all.  Unscripted, raw and unabashed, many travelers, like myself, on this brick-road of dreams became part of the show, part of the illusion.  Parading all walks and stages of life in a cluster fuck of desire, lusting to be wowed and dazzled by the ludicrous irony of what money can buy when lost in such volume.

Ah, the Strip.  An enduring American creation like hamburgers, jazz, Elvis and Coca-Cola.  It beckons you like a Siren promising you your dreams.  The more you charm her with your riches the more alluring, yet allusive she becomes.  Enter at your own risk.  Only possibilities await.

Make sure you do come with someone else (especially if your a female) for safety purposes as there is a lot of drunks that walk the Strip (duh!).

Also Women... I have seen lots of you wear High Heels... common now you need to bring your walking shoes when you come out here! At the end of the night you're walking bare foot anyways. 

Have a fun time and Enjoy Beatiful Las Vegas!",5
Local Flavor,"This is the heart of Las Vegas...flashing neon lights, hotels, shopping, restaurants, the gorgeous Bellagio Fountain, women/men passing out porn fliers, and everything else imaginable can be seen on the strip. Let me warn you, it is a b**ch trying to get from one end of the strip to the other due to traffic.",4
Local Flavor,"Well everyone should experience The Strip of Las Vegas at least once in their lifetime! Is like nothing else. Is visually interesting, specially at night with all the lights. Yep you will see tons of tourists, lots of young drunk people acting like idiots, some men and women completely passed out in the sidewalk, families, some arrests, street performers, some women showing off their bodies of all shapes and sizes, shoppers, people passing all kinds of flyers, and some people well, just walking the strip. 

Regardless of your purpose in Vegas, there is a lot of things to see and do during the day, and well during the night! All Hotels/Casinos have great places to be entertained, party, drink, shop, dine in.

For first timers, if your planning to walk the whole strip, wear comfortable shoes! There is tons of walking and even if the buildings you are going to seem close, the walking paths are long, mostly because you have to cross the streets by crossing bridges with added pathways that add to your walk. Others walk through the casinos  which seems like it adds miles on your walk, because some are like mazes from the inside. 

Also, for those enjoying the nightlife, planning to dance, and looking all good for the rest of the night, walking should be avoided. You will sweat, mess up your hair, and your feet won't be happy with you. 

The best way to get from point A to point B,  is by taking a taxi. Of course, this means having taxi spending money. On average about $10-$12 bucks plus tip. If your in a group, is only a couple bucks each person. Lastly, the traffic is slow, so if you got to be in a place at an specific time (example if your going to one of the shows) give yourself plenty of time to get there. Traffic is heavy in the the night. You can drive anywhere, but good luck finding parking.",3
Local Flavor,"Definitely a unique place in this world. Something you have to see in your lifetime!

Be prepared for the ultimate culture shock. You can seriously see ALL different types of the human race here. Between awkward business professionals in suits, ""drunk of their mind"" chicks wearing almost nothing, total white trash, rednecks, bachelors, and more, you are in for the ultimate experience! 

The resorts/casinos here are a hit or miss. Some of them are total dives! I simply can't understand how they are still profitable. They must serve the clowns that enjoy stench bucket lobbies filled with smoke, cheezy dancers, and constant gamboling.

I swear some of the casino floors look like a Chuck E. Cheese for adults with all the bright, flashing lights!

One of my biggest pet peeves here is those stupid clowns that hand out those ""hot girls want to meet you"" cards!! Seriously! They swarm you on every corner. They will even have four of them in a line trying to get you to take them. Come on Las Vegas, clean up your act! Most of the cards with pictures of women with no clothes on end up as litter on the ground anyways. Outlaw that stupid BS! If people are looking for those kind of services, they can easily find a way to use them! Those stupid cards aren't going to change their minds! 

I did notice there were none of these stupid clowns outside the Wynn and Encore properties. Maybe it's the demographic there? Or maybe they actually have a policy against it. Either way, I would stay there for that reason alone!!

As other Yelpers mentioned, even though neighboring properties look close, they are actually a long walk! Pedestrians are often slowed down by the constant overcrowded  sidewalks and are redirected over these bridges with TONS of stairs! They are not right at the intersections either, mostly trying to force you into shops or casinos. Keep in mind, there is always a way to get back down, you just have to find the stairs. 

Bring comfortable shoes if you plan to walk the strip. Also, many of the so-called trams and the famous monorail are sometimes not practical. The stations are located in the VERY BACK parts of all the casinos. By the time you walk all the way through one casino (especially if you are staying on the West side of the strip, you have to cross the street and enter another resort to pick up the monorail), get on the monorail (they charge for tickets too) and walk all the way down from the casino you disembark at, you miswell should have just walked to your destination the whole way.

Some of the cab drivers are absolutely nuts!! I seriously thought this one dude was going to roll the Ford Escape we were driving in on some of the turns. Our ride from the airport wasn't that bad though. Splurge for a town car one night to make your experience more enjoyable (we took one from the Cosmo to Wynn for a fancy dinner at SW Steakhouse). 

Enjoy your time on the strip!",4
Local Flavor,"Am Las Vegas Strip liegen fast alle Luxushotels und Kasinos in dem
Bereich des Las Vegas Boulevard.
Viele dieser Hotels gehören zu den 20 Hotels mit den meisten Zimmern weltweit. An
diesem Boulevard gibt es über
150.000 Hotelzimmer. Er beginnt im Süden, fast am Flughafen, mit dem Mandalay
Bai und der Little Church oft he West (hier geben sich viele das Ja Wort) und
endet am Stratosphere Tower im Norden. Der Strip gehört zu den All-American Roads, d.h. er ist eine

ist ein unvergessliches Erlebnis",5
Local Flavor,Fun to go sight seeing both during the day and at night. The bright lights at night are a beautiful sight too! Make sure you have comfy shoes on since you're going to be walking around a LOT and don't forget to hop from one hotel or casino to another for sight seeing and a little gambling. :),5
Local Flavor,"The Las Vegas Strip is nothing but a tourist attraction to draw in $$$ for the city of Las Vegas. It also has some of the best entertainment venues that are PG rated to XXX, casual to fine dining that are owned by world renowned chefs and some of the most opulent 5 star hotels that you can't find anywhere else in the world like Wynn, Encore and Bellagio all created by Steve Wynn.

It also attracts tourists from all over the world but mostly Europeans and Asians because of the gaming and entertainment industry. Also the usual drunks, douche bags, pick pockets, hustler's, hookers, lost tourists and some Californians. 

Enjoy!

Have Fun!

Stay Safe!",4
Local Flavor,"In preparation for a Vegas list I am putting together for future reference, I am back tracking on this review from a few years ago when I saw U2 and spent a few days in Vegas. It is a long walk, almost an hour from one end to the other, however, walking through all the nice hotels from one end to the other, the shops, passing through cheesy souvenir shops etc is worth it. I do this more for the people watching than the actual shops themselves. I collect those 1-800 escort cards that are handed out day and night on the strip as cheap souvenirs back home for my male friends. The models on the cards are better than those that are advertised in the Vancouver Georgia Straight. If you're too hot a lot of hotels are air conditioned and if you hate walking outside in general most of the hotels are connected. You can even drink your alcohol in cheesy themed cups.",5
Local Flavor,Sin City is an inferno! Keep cool and drink plenty of beer. Or water. Or alcohol loaded slushies in an endless cup.,4
Local Flavor,"Cosa dire di Vegas...
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, Baby!
Questa città è incredibile perché è fintamente bellissima ed ogni volta che si torna si scopre un nuovo pezzettino.",5
Local Flavor,"The Las Vegas Strip is an absolutely magical place filled with wonder and delight! The casino buildings are massive and have the most creative architecture and design. The details of the design are most visible during the day but at night they take on their own unique look. When all of the casinos are lit up, the strip is so festive and fascinating! In my opinion, Vegas was made for the night. That's when it comes to life!

Some attractions you can find while walking the strip are the fountains at the Bellagio, the gondolas at the Venetian, the pirate show at Treasure Island and the water wall at Aria. There are also street performers along the strip as well as costumed actors who will allow you to take photos for a tip.

If you plan to be sober during your trip, you can attempt renting a car and driving on the strip. Just be aware that the cabbies pretty much rule the road and are very aggressive drivers. I recommend walking and taking a cab for longer distances ESPECIALLY if you plan to drink. You can also weigh out the pricing. Rental cars generally are $50 a day and unless you are driving to every casino, it's most likely that you will NOT spend this much money on cabs each day. My husband and I went the cab route and spent on average $20 per day for the both of us. 

I personally feel that the Las Vegas strip is a 21+ type of party, however if you are planning on bringing a family with young children, consider the following things that you may see on the strip: Intoxicated individuals, racy clothing, partial nudity, lots of alcoholic beverages, peddlers with inappropriate signs, people handing out prostitution/strip club ads showing naked women, ad trucks that go up and down the strip with naked women on them and last time I went there was a random arrest so i'll throw that one in too. Again, this list is just to let parents know what can be seen by their children if they plan on coming on a family vacation.

I have had so many good times here, I love the strip! There are tons of awesome things to do in all of the casinos and I think it's a great experience. Definitely the ultimate party spot! Now it's time to start planning your trip! :)",5
Local Flavor,"Some days it's better than others... If people weren't so rude, obeyed the traffic laws and actually paid attention to the stop lights there'd be a lot less headaches & swearing.",4
Local Flavor,"If Las Vegas was a movie, The Strip would be the big star. According to the Ritz-Carlton's Foursquare, the Strip is home to 19 of the world's 25 largest hotels. 

Most of Vegas's famous hotels and casinos are here, so if you come to Vegas for a vacation (most likely you will be, but I don't want to assume it because people do come here for other reasons), you will most likely spend some time on the strip.

The Strip looks impressive even driving through it, but don't limit yourself to your car, even if it's hot outside. There's lots more inside the hotels and casinos and you can see a lot more by walking around.

The Strip also gets very hot during the summer (even at night!), so bring water. You'll most likely be parking at a hotel/casino and walking everywhere.

Thanks to pedestrian bridges that go over the street, you won't have to cross a street as many times as you would on any other city street. However, this makes for a lot more walking.

Like any popular tourist area, there are lots of homeless people, some of which give me the creeps. Walking down the strip at night is also not fun because of the drunks and all around rowdiness. There are also a lot of oblivious, obnoxious tourists. People, I know the strip photographs beautifully, especially at night (it really does), but step out of the way when you're doing your picture taking. Too often will people stop in the middle of a large crowd to take a picture. My suggestion? Snap some shots when you're already waiting for something. That way you won't be in anybody's way. Snap a few photos while you're waiting for the Bellagio fountains to start. Take a few shots while you're waiting to cross the street (but keep an eye on the walk signal!)

Despite the creepiness, The Strip is really something that must be visited when you're in Vegas!",3
Local Flavor,"The Strip is freakin' amazing day & night. Beautiful lights & fun everywhere!! There is always lots of promotions & deals at hotels & don't forget about the Deuce Bus that runs through the whole entire strip from Mandalay Bay Hotel ALL THE WAY TO FREMONT STREET.  You HAVE to experience Vegas AT LEAST ONCE in your life time. So much to do!! I love it so much!! 

The only reason I gave it 4 stars & not 5 is cuz I hate that the cross walks are so far away from each other. It makes us stay in the sun longer, but at least every single building has air conditioning.",4
Local Flavor,"What a slimmy rip off dump. Everybody has their hand out. Street performers, beggars, pimps. On the crossover by the Cesar's  I watch two 3 card monte operations within 25 feet of each other. There are 3 card monte crews up and down the strip. The cops don't seem to care.
Being a New Yorker I remember Times Square before Disney screwed it up and at its worst it wasn't as bad as the Las Vegas Strip is today. Everything on the Strip costs twice as much as it does a couple of blocks east in so called normal areas with Walmarts, supermarkets at normal competitive prices.
They say when the old regime ran Vegas it was a much better place. The only crime allowed was what they committed. They took care off problems.",1
Local Flavor,"As a former resident of Las Vegas, there's a special place in my heart for the Strip.  It's truly a unique place where you can have a good time.  It's bee over 2 yrs since my last review, which was when I still lived in this awesome city.  Since then, I've returned to the city several times and have watched the Strip gradually decline.  What was once a 5 Star experience is now a 4 Star experience.  Here's a breakdown of my thoughts:

Pros
+ It's still very exciting and full of energy.

+ Everything on the Strip is big and over the top.  It's a place where dreams become reality.

+ There's never a lack of crowds, no matter what day it is.

+ There's something for everyone....from low end joints for the value consumer to the luxury joints for the wealthy, you can find a wide variety of entertainment.

+ The people watching here is amazing and highly entertaining.

Cons
- The sidewalks are littered with freaks and idiots pan handling for money.  Dressed like super heroes (ok, that was cool for about 1 min) or weird outfits, these people harass you for money.

- There's still a large presence of sex pushers handing out cards for strippers (hookers) to your room.  It's annoying and most of the hand bills end up on the ground littering the city.

- There are a lot of sketchy people (pimps, drug dealers, and opportunistic criminals) mixed up in the crowds waiting to pounce on an unsuspecting victim.  There didn't use to be that much of this....only until the last 3 yrs or so has this really increased dramatically.

Overall, it's still a fantastic place to party and people watch.  I hope they clean up the sidewalks and return it to 5 Star status.

Return Factor - 100%",4
Local Flavor,"The strip is a party zone chock full of street performers, con artists, pan handlers and prostitute hawkers.  If you go to Vegas for the ""strip"" you might love it if you have these expectations.  However, if you come to vegas for specific entertainment (shows) and features, the strip might be more of a nuisance, and that's where my visit falls.  

I couldn't walk a half block without being accosted (for lack of a better word) by any of the above people looking for a way to part a me from my money, using claims of ""Free"" or ""I do this for tips"" and so on.  When I walked away from some of these folks I started getting attitude.  That's not to say there aren't some legitimate people trying to make a legitimate living on the strip, I've just met enough people in various places that have quelled my level of trust when meeting strangers, especially those who claim to want to sell me something for ""Free"" on the street.

There is a good deal of sightseeing on the strip if one can get past the strangers who want your cash, each hotel and casino is unique in its own way.  Each public show on the street is unique as are many of the small shops and stores.  When walking the strip, one needs to keep in mind, they don't call it ""Sin City"" for nothing.",2
Local Flavor,"Just came back from Las vegas today and it was a pretty great weekend Except for one thing. That one thing is the the con artists roaming the strip night and day. Beware of wannabe artist and their ""producers"" who will try to give u a FREE CD and say they just want to get recongition. THAT IS TOTAL BS DO NOT FALL FOR THEIR SWEET TALK AND SHIT THAT THEY SPIT OUT. After handing my friend the CD the artist start asking for a donation which my friend gave but than the producer came over and said that I should give him another $5 to make it a $10. After that things got messy because they were pretty insistent on me giving them another $5 so i asked them why. The producer than said "" oh because the CD cost $10"". WHAT KIND OF F$%#ING BS IS THAT?!?!  First they will say they are giving you a free CD but than they will try to get money off of u so beware of those freaken lowlife scam artist. Also if they ask for your name DO NOT GIVE IT TO THEM. They will just sign your name on their CD and try to force you to pay a rediculous amount for that CD. 

God LV strip became a dump for trash like those, feel bad for those that are actually legit street performers.",2
Local Flavor,"First time and went in Dec.  The weather was nice while my east coast was freezing...oh well.  One of a few places where you can walk and ride with an alcoholic beverage, see performances and hop to restaurants casinos, shops and more in a 6 mile strip!  We loved it and hung out all day and night.  Not a place for kids at all!   New Orleans (havent been) and Seoul, S. Korea are the other cities that we drank on the street that I know of.  Viva Las Vegas!",5
Local Flavor,"The family went down to the Strip to eat and walk around. We found ourselves taking Pix with every street character we could find. If any other local family wants to enjoy an easy and fun experience, bring your camera and 20 bucks in singles for tips and enjoy our town.",5
Local Flavor,"Reading all the reviews of the Strip here on Yelp, I'm taken with the huge range of ratings and opinions of this 4+ mile of road. Yes, it has the best of things, and yes, it has the worst of things. I suppose one's rating reflects what aspect/s of this famous terrain one focuses on. I focus not on the homeless guy sleeping against a wall but instead I marvel at the neon bombardment of colors. I focus not on the thousands of flyers underfoot of naked women, advertising escort services, but instead I am enchanted by the dancing fountains, the music, St. Mark's Square and the Eiffel Tower and the New York skyline in close proximity to each other. 

Let's face it: this is one of the most iconic geographical places in the US - probably the world, actually. It is immediately recognizable by young and old alike. Of course it has the most of the most of everything. That is part of its charm.

If you decide to walk the Strip, be prepared for a hike. It's deceptively long when you take into consideration all the criss-crossing, traversing, up and down stair walking and escalator riding you will do. On my recent trip here, a good quarter of the escalators were not working and a lot of construction was going on. If one were disabled, one would have a hard time indeed navigating some of these overpasses. 

There are some fun and funky shops, malls and stores along the way to explore and God knows, lots of restaurants. We enjoyed going into all the major casinos/hotels to get a feel of the various themes, the architecture and artwork. I consider much of the Strip to be like a Disneyland for adults. Half of it looks like a movie set, with pirate ships and Roman colliseums within a block or so. Outlandish - but again, this is part of the charm that is Vegas. We loved going into Caesar's and riding the circular escalators and checking out the uber-high-end boutiques, and visiting the centrally-located Sephora. My folks went to the mall housing Macy's but I opted out, having all these stores in Seattle. There's the ""Fashion Center"" and the M&M shop. One can spend the day - or more! - just walking and checking out all the stores and hotels and street musicians, and get one's fill of entertainment without spending a dime.

I was there at Christmas-time, and I must say, the decorations in the hotels and along the square by the Venetian were simply gorgeous. In fact, they had outdoor festivals at night by the Venetian tree (which was glorious), and they were mesmerizing. Who needs to gamble to have fun? 

One point of note: unbeknownst to us, you cannot flag down a cab to drive you to your destination, so if you get tired walking, you'll have to somehow crawl to a taxi stand outside a hotel to legally catch a cab. There's a city law that forbids cabbies from picking up passengers who aren't at a legit cabbie stand. Who knew???",4
Local Flavor,"I came right after the New Year for my birthday thinking that everyone was gone already... nope, the party's still going! I walked here during the day and thought it was okay. During the night? That's when our fun start!! The lights were just amazing and really had us pumped up!

With shows, shops, casinos, and buffets all given to us on one long street, we had plenty of things to keep us busy. However, it does get pricy so I would definitely come when you have the cash to burn. Otherwise, you can just watch people gamble, attend free shows, and window shop.",4
Local Flavor,"In Vegas, but don't feel like partying and getting drunk? Check out the strip! It will keep you busy and entertained for a while.

Pretty much, everything is on the strip: all the hotels, food, shows, drinks, bars, clubs, shopping...

It's alright in the daytime, but it's super nice at night with all the lights. I had fun just walking around and going to each themed building and taking pictures and watching some free shows on the street (like the fountains in front of the Bellagio or the fire show in front of the Flamingo).

The sidewalks are really weird though. You have to take ramps up into some buildings to continue walking sometimes. And despite the down season after NYE, there's still a lot of people walking around!

Overall, it's a cool strip to check out and it's a good cheap and fun alternative if you don't want to spend too much money.",4
Local Flavor,"Adult Disneyland. Where the world comes to play. Bond w/girlfriends, emotional struggles w/a lover? Reconnect w/your carefree spirit and rage an all nighter w/an international crowd. I dig the vibe, the art, late hours and female Dj's. These bad @ss bitches inspire me when they blast rockets at posh clubs.  Every time I need a break.  I pack a bag and point my car in that direction. Aside from what everyone else will most likely yelp about... shows, conventions, celebrities, cabana's, hot bodies, limo service, bottle service, foodie adventures, sport events, one armed bandits and table suckers.  I come coz ""I live for the night, I live for the lights, I live for the high til' I'm free falling."" Will be back more often",4
Local Flavor,"At first glance you're thinking wow, this is so cool. Gradually you move into a place of disgust and then one of ""get me the hell outta here!""

As we all know Las Vegas is a virtual adult playground and The Strip works well to promote that whole idea. When I lived in Vegas, my friend and I would often go there because that's just what you did. Cheap buffets, movies, shows, etc., etc. You were never in want of anything to do. Well, gone is anything cheap in this superficial Mecca.

I often return to visit the friends I left behind but on one of those days when I was there and nobody was feeling well, I decided to revisit that which IS Las Vegas: The Las Vegas Strip. Bellagio, Paris, Caesar's, etc., and the more time I spent there the worse I felt, eventually disgusted. Plastic people milling about everywhere, bros and hoes on every block, waiting to see where their next drink is coming from, acting like moronic children. Typical Vegas ho: Blond streaked, ironed hair, tight jeans with a cuff, and pumps. Oh, and half their junk out. Bros? Well, they're just immature boys with flat brimmed ball caps, on the prowl, lookin' for the hoes and hopin' to get their pencil wet. 

If huge crowds of bros and hoes is your thing then have at it here. Me? I'm just over it. The whole time I was there I was just thinking, what kind of people would want to come here? Then I look around and go, oh yeah. That kind.

In the future my trips to Vegas will be only to visit friends and to limit my exposure to Vegas frivolity. Take me somewhere. Anywhere but here... please! Somehow, I think that was my last Strip experience... EVER! I'll visit next year but next time no Vegasy shit for me.",1
Local Flavor,"It's Vegas Baby!  So much to do and so much to see!  Before living here, we used to vacation here a lot because it's affordable no matter what you would like to do.  Even if you just want to people watch, this is the place to do it.  There are so many people from around the world that love to visit Vegas.  

The strip offers one of the largest varieties of restaurants all packed in one area.   Famous chef's such as Emeril Lagasse and Gordon Ramsay have all opened up several restaurants to dine in.   There are many many more cuisine's to choose from. Depending on what hotel you are staying in, they sometimes will give you coupons for a restaurant on their grounds.

It's not just dining, there are shows galore to see.  Comedians, music concerts and the Vegas staples that are here on a daily basis.  If you know way in advance of the dates you'll be here, I'd recommend buying tickets ahead of time for some of the headlining bands or comedians.  

My only gripe would be about the 'flippy' card people along the strip.   Yes we all know about the call girls but when I don't take a card from the guy standing right next to you,... please don't try to hand me the same one.  

Otherwise we love to just wander up and down the strip.  Good exercise, good food and good entertainment!",4
Local Flavor,"The Vegas Strip is really awesome!  Afterall, where else can you find more casinos and places to gamble your money?  The most popular shows are usually Cirque Du Soleil.  ""Half-price Tix"" is usually the place to get show tickets for less money.  Make sure you save lots of money for your trip to Vegas.",5
Local Flavor,"I go to LV for people watching and strip literally never sleeps. You have early risers (usually a family group) and people who just arrived strolling about along with people hungover trying to find their way back to the hotel in the morning. Crowd starts to build as the fountain show begins at 11AM at the Bellagio and people trying to fill their stomachs for the excitement that is to come. Crowd gets larger as the sun sets as people walk faster than traffic now. Lights starts to sparkle and many stalling foot traffic, taking in the spectacle laid before their eyes along with tour groups with their guide holding a flag trying to hit all the attractions amidst the frenzied mob. And once again night comes which brings out the craziness of everyone trying to live the quote ""what happens in vegas, stays in vegas"" . 
What's not to love about the strip~",5
Local Flavor,"Going down. 
Every time I go to Vegas walking the strip is part of the trip. Like it or not.
It would seem to me that on my annual trips the amount of crap along the strip has increased quite a bit.
I have been going regularly since 2004 and in that short period the ""Class"" of the strip has gone down.
There are too many card clickers, ppl with horrible low budget costumes clogging sidewalks ( especially out front of Bellagio), crispy bums, people selling water, people aggressively  ""giving"" away home made cd's. 
I expect this kind of bush league crap on Fremont street but it would be nice if I didn't have to deal with it on the strip.
I didn't see any police presence and I saw 1 staff from Bellagio watching the gong show along the sidewalk in front of the fountains.

ITS SUPPOSED TO BE CLASSY VEGAS!!!

Smarten up. Ship this crap off somewhere else where they can exercise their rights.",2
Local Flavor,"If I lived here I would probably be dead in a year. LOL! Walk the strip and view the freak show that is AMURRICA!

Sure, when in Vegas it's almost mandatory to take a walk on The Strip to view the sights. To me it's always better at night when everything is lit up in all it's cheesy glory! Plus, if there during the summer season walking The Strip in the day is inviting heat stroke! Damn, it's hot over here. 

Don't get fooled by the optical illusion thinking that the casino you want to walk to is close as after shlepping a half hour you realize you should have taken a cab, the monorail, or the shuttle that runs along The Strip. Still, the views of the massive casinos all lit up and the free shows make it worth a trek up and down The Strip. The Pirate Show at Treasure Island, the Volcano at the Mirage, the Dancing Waters at the Bellagio to name a few.

Hey, at least you are allowed to drink in public here so load up a cold one and have at it as you walk by the hordes of tourists, Eurotrash, bachelor and bachelorette parties, and assorted middle America white trash WalMart crowd that seems to gather here. Don't forget to view the crazies, homeless, porn card slappers, bad street performers, drunk blotto people, and those annoying characters in knock off costumes posing for money. The craziness never ends! It's almost like being in Times Square NYC!

The Las Vegas Strip is an amusement park of kitschy weirdness in itself. I love cheesy and approve totally! 

As Arnold would say - ""I'll Be Back""!",4
Local Flavor,Vegas baby Vegas! Been coming to vegas for years. I still love all the lights and the glow of Vegas night life. They are constantly changing things and its only getting better as the years pass ...,5
Local Flavor,"My favorite part of Vegas - right here.

Sure it's nice to walk around in the daytime, but it's better in the night. Why? Because that's when everything is completely lit up! Keep those cameras handy when you're walking around here. You can even take some pictures of certain areas of the strip when you're walking on the ""overhead"" crosswalks. It's not just the lights to enjoy, but also some of the free shows that are available, including Mirage's Volcano and Bellagio's Dancing Water Fountains.

Be mindful of your surroundings when walking around, especially in the night. Sure it's touristy, but as what some other reviewers pointed out, there were some sketchy people hanging around (panhandlers, con artists, etc.). For this reason, I take away one star.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back here!",4
Local Flavor,Vegas Baby Vegas! Ever since I was a kid I have loved the concept of the glitz and glamour of Vegas. Luv the nighttime lights and they are constantly expanding and building. I have seen some awesome shows. My fav of course is Criss Angel. Vegas will always be awesome!,5
Local Flavor,starting to look old and a little run down.,3
Local Flavor,"Vegas is an adult Disney World. Don't get me wrong, I love Disney World (even as an adult) but it's so much funner with good food and booze. Plus you can still see Minnie Mouse - except in Vegas she's twerking on the sidewalk for tips. No seriously, there's people dressed up as characters everywhere on the stirp!

I think the Vegas Strip is one of the best values in entertainment. Well, because it's basically FREE once you arrive to Vegas. Hopping around from hotel to hotel, seeing how amazingly detailed the designs and architecture are it really is an adult playground. Want to go to Paris? No problem! Want to go to Egypt? Just a few more steps that way. Have  a time machine handy to go nose to nose with Ceasar? No need - he's chillin' in his pallace right over there.

My highlights would be:

Bellagio - This is one of the nicest hotels on the strip and their lobby has that insane glass art on the ceiling. The fountains are possibly the most impressive sight on the strip. Plus, there's a mini chocolate waterfall. Must see.

Luxor - I've always wanted to go to Egypt and while I am sure the Air Conditioned lobby of the Luxor is a bit more comfortable than actual Cairo the attention to detail here is amazing. Statues that feel stand 100 feet tall, and the entire building is in the shape of a pyramid. Fun fact: The elevators go SIDEWAYS up the side of the pyramid! 

Caesars Palace: Such a nice hotel! The decorations and designs are phenomenal! They have amazing fountains and statues patterned after Rome. They even have their own Coliseum - but instead of fighting to the death you can pay a ton of money to hear people sing! 

New York, New York not only has one of the best exterior designs (looks like the NY skyline!) but, it also has a roller coaster and the inside looks just like New York with a late night pizza spot open behind the casino.

Paris is cool with the mock Eiffel Tower and the inside has some mock balconies that indeed look like the streets of Paris.

Excalibur is probably best for kids - or ladies that want to feel the Thunder Down Under! 

The Venetian has gorgeous painted ceilings (like clouds) and you can ride a gondola through the hotel! 

Mandalay Bay is cool, but being from Florida you won't find it too fascinating. It's all ""tropical"" and basically reminded me of the resorts in the Bahamas.

Wynn -  There are no outside attractions here - instead it's all inside so you HAVE to come in to see them. Went to Vegas once, close to the holidays and the Wynn had their lobby decked out for Christmas. They have a nice garden (INSIDE) that was full of lights and decorations. The Lake of Dreams looks AMAZING but I haven't had the chance to witness it in person. My favorite Vegas show is at the Wynn: Le Reve!


All in all you could easily spend 2 days seeing just the hotels on the strip. Pop into each one, browse around, take pics, maybe place a wager in the casino, get a bite, get a drink, then hop on over to the next one. I've done it all walking but there is also a shuttle that takes you up and down the strip.",5
Local Flavor,"What could I possibly say that hasn't already been said? The STRIP is THE place to be when in Vegas for all things fun! Walk around and enjoy all of the food, drink, music, shopping, shows, bright lights, incredible buildings, street entertainers, the Bellagio fountains, FANTASTIC people watching...all the while with a beer or cocktail in each hand of course!

The Strip offers all of the Sinful Goodness that makes Las Vegas what it is!

If you're looking for a quiet getaway...stay away! Vegas is not for you baby! Viva....vivaaa...Las Veeeeegaas!!!",5
Local Flavor,"Hm I'm not sure why I'm reviewing the strip, but I guess it's because I CAN
ok so if you've never been to vegas before the strip is the main street where all the main hotels are, there are tons of restaurants and shops up and down the street, there is north strip and south strip, north has hotels like the venetian/palazzo etc.. and south is more mgm, luxor, and four seasons

it's usually hot as eff walking up and down the strip so be prepared for that, it's VERY packed and certain streets you can only cross by using a bridge so keep an eye out for that and don't get trapped and have to walk extra! 

if you've never been to vegas before it's definitely fun checking out and seeing what's around but there really isn't anything too exciting to be honest, lots of weirdos walking around too",5
Local Flavor,"Wait until it's dark, and walk along the entire Vegas strip. I have driven down the Strip, and it just isn't the same. The night life here is amazing. The highlights consist of Paris, New York, Luxor, and The Mirage Volcano. There are a number of prominent hotels/casinos along the way (i.e. The Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, Aria, and Wynn). There is also an amazing water show across from Paris that goes off every 15 min, and the volcano goes off every 30 minutes. If nothing else, there are great photo oppurtunities. The Strip is definitely worth doing at least once.",5
Local Flavor,"""It's The Famous Strip!!""
Of course this cannot be rated anything less than 5 stars because let's be honest here does it get any better than being able to walk down the street with alcoholic beverages in your hand without having to worry about anything in the world?! I always have a blast on the strip because of all the local entertainers that have on these crazy costumes of cartoons. Sometimes you even run into people who are trying to be actors from Hollywood! What takes the cake of everything is just simply the view of all of the hotels lit up at night. I advise if you are visiting to rent a convertible, hands down the best way to experience the strip!",5
Local Flavor,"I didn't even know The Strip has its own Yelp listing.  Hah!

What can be said that hasn't been said before?  The Entertainment Capital of the World truly lives up to its name.  It has glamour and glitz, booze and good food, lots of flashing skin from ladies and gents alike, et cetera.  You can hit all the deadly sins in Sin City in 24-hours --- maybe even less than that if you're truly crazy!

Some highlights of The Strip includes the pirate show at Treasure Island, the volcano show at Mirage, the gardens at Caesar's Palace, the Bellagio fountains, the gondola rides with singing gondoliers at Venetian, and the ever-bright light that beams out of Luxor [as if the light pollution here wasn't bad enough].  You can bungee jump, go on The High Roller Ferris wheel, and even ride a roller-coaster here.

And even though all that sounds kid friendly, please Please PLEASE don't bring the children.  Sure there are arcades at most hotels but it's really all they can do.  They can't even walk the casino floors so what's the point?  Plus the ""Pokemon cards"" as my crew likes to call them are passed about at every intersection.  Do you really want to explain why there are girls with naughty bits being shown on business cards, flyers, and moving automobiles everywhere?

Take the time and walk through all the hotels at least once.  Every hotel is themed differently, millions are spent on decorations, and each has a different and distinct smell piping through their fancy scent systems.  Walk, don't drive, down The Strip during the night because that's when it's all twinkling lights and good cheer.  

You might not be able to see the stars in the sky but keep your eyes open because you might see a different kind of star walking ahead of you!",4
Local Flavor,"Vegas is fun with its lights, shows and buffets. Not everyone gambles or goes to the clubs! There are so many exhibits at the different Casino that it can take days to actually have gone to all the casinos.  The casinos are smokey but I expected that having been here before.  Coming with my family gave me a different view of Vegas.  Since they were not rushing to various scenes, I was able to visit Vegas and not just the strip but also take my time enjoying the sights and sounds of the strip.  There are LOTS of LIGHTS at night and the energy alone makes the temperature hot there lol My family had a great time and we would come again, especially if we're staying in a resort off the strip!",5
Local Flavor,"It's the strip!! What more can you ask for?! People watching, taking to strangers, unpredictable incidents happening, and awesome sightseeing. There are just so much to enjoy on the strip! Look at Joyce W's review for the highlights of the strip. If you want to take a picture of the ""Welcome to the Last Vegas"" sign, that's a little farther up the strip (the end of the strip). Make sure you have a bottle of water with you. It gets really hot! Do purchase the 24-hour bus ticket and enjoy the air-conditioned double decker bus.",5
Local Flavor,"Sin City bitches! I'd like to write a review, but you know what they say ""What happens in Vegas...""",5
Local Flavor,"The Strip of Las Vegas has something for everyone!! It is awesome they have their own Yelp page!  I have been coming to Vegas since I was 4-years old; I spent a lot of time downtown and on Fremont Street but as I've gotten older I go towards the Strip for certain things.

If you are going at anytime between April and October it is going to be hot! It is the desert, so drink lots of water. The nice thing is that you can duck into any casino to cool off.  This is every adult's play-land - clubs, casinos and drinks! Pool parties by day at almost every casino, some of the hottest clubs at night, plus amazing shows and being able to walk down the street with a drink in your hand...all available 24/7/365.",5
Local Flavor,"I love all the entertainment and sights, but must warn you. DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING FROM ANYONE EVEN IF THEY SAY IT IS FREE. You may be able to get some coupons without being roped into something, but there are people on the streets who will promise you free shows for watching their presentation. You do get free stuff, however you also get 4 hours of very pushy sales people. Just know what you are getting into. Also Las Vegas stinks like sewage, and is very dirty, don't touch anything and carry around sanitizer. Have fun, its an experiance.",3
Local Flavor,"Literally, my favorite place on Earth, and not just because I grew up there. The Strip is amazing in every way!",5
Local Flavor,"On the plus side, there are a lot of lights on the Strip!   From a distance, it looks glamorous and fun.

Up close, it's a different story.

Up close, it just makes me sad.  I feel sad because if tourists come here from other countries and base their opinion of the US solely on what they see on the Strip, they would think we are a bunch of overweight alcoholics, who wear clothes that are much too tight and short, and that we want prostitutes to come to our hotel rooms in 10 minutes.  

I know, I sound like a prude. But as I see another drunk young lady, teetering in ridiculous heels, valiantly chugging from a yard long plastic vessel full of some sugary sweet, booze-filled drink, I have to wonder if she is really having fun or if she just thinks she is.

Another thing that is particularly depressing to me is the women who are handing out cards for ""dates"" that you can have in your hotel room in 10 minutes.  Do they understand what they are doing to these other women, who are someone's sister, daughter, mother?

Walking down the Strip at night, I pray for humanity.   

In the morning, it's actually pretty nice though and a good place for a run.",2
Local Flavor,"Viva Las Vegas!  The iconic Las Vegas strip is a fun filled street along Las Vegas Boulevard that has something for everyone.  Whether you are needing a place to stay, wanting to get something to eat, feel like a relaxing spa or pool, going to dance the night away at the trendiest night clubs, or catching a show, the strip of Las Vegas has it all.  You don't have to be a gambler to enjoy the sights and sounds of the strip, there are plenty of hotels with activities for you to do.  Check out vegas.com to book your hotels, shows, restaurants, and activities.  Also, if you are a Triple A member, be sure to ask if there is a discount when you make your reservations.  So whether it's day or night, take a stroll down the Las Vegas strip, where fun is everywhere!",5
Local Flavor,"As a local and someone who works on the strip, I have to call out the Mayor and all the Fat Cats to get rid of THE SEWER SMELL that permeates everywhere, especially around HARRAH's / CAESAR's from Spring Mountain to Flamingo. My God it takes your breath away.",2
Local Flavor,"Let's talk about the 800 POUND ELEPHANT on the STRIP!!!!

THE STENCH!!!!!!!

It takes a strong person to walk on the Strip from Spring Mountain to Flamingo, especially on the Harrah's side!! The sewage smell is overwhelming! I have been told by many locals and workers that there is nothing that can be done about it!

REALLY!!!!

Hey Your Honor, Ms. Goodman....com'on....let's take a walk....just bring your barf bag",1
Local Flavor,"Its Vegas. I use to be a local so its not my favorite place.  But as a tourist im sure its a blast. Lots of walking for sure and tons of people in minimal clothes if thats your thing.  I don't recommend it as a place for children with the high amounts of nudity, drunk and vulgar people. Lots of lights to see. Over sized drinks that you can wear around your neck. 
sure why not. 21 and over have some fun.",4
Local Flavor,"Who doesn't love this place? 
What's not to love?
Crazies, drunks, homeless people, show girls, partiers, clubbers, families, and all of it next to 24 hour fun, shopping, eating, and people watching.
I LOVE VEGAS.  :)
What you have, what you want, and what you need can practically be found here for a price. It's pretty crazy when you think about it.
Wander in and out of casinos, sit at a balcony bar and watch the action, and just enjoy because this weird mix is something you just don't see anywhere else.

If you lived here, it would probably be boring and mundane, but for me, it's always been exciting and fun!!",5
Local Flavor,"The Strip hotels have instituted a new unadvertised scam. It called ""Resort Fee"" which is an unadvertised fee that's add to you hotel rate. Plus it's subject to sales tax. Your a loser even before you step up to the machines.",1
Local Flavor,"Do you really think that Las Vegas is only for the gambler from around the world? If so, you are seriously mistaken...

Taking a walk down the strip can have many different outlooks, depending on what time of day that you travel down it. 

During the day attracts the shoppers, the gamblers & the people hunting down a cool place to hide on a hot summers day. 

Dusk brings out even more gamblers, the drinkers, more people looking for air conditioning and most importantly the lights & glamour of the Vegas Strip Shows and different features that many of the big casinos have, for example the Bellagio Fountains, the Mirage Volcano, etc etc. 

A must see for any bachelor, couple, family or anyone in between. A must see in the United States but would probably recommend a maximum of 4 of 5 nights per visit to this desert oasis.",5
Local Flavor,"I've noticed in the mega casinos on the strip a lack of EXIT signs whether by design or bribes to the fire officials it creates a very possibly disastrous situation if case of earthquake, terror, or fire in the inability to safely exit the casino.",3
Local Flavor,"Well if you love lights this is the place. The entire strip is bright and flashy at night time. You will enjoy it at first and take lot of pictures and then it seems the same. Bellagio fountain is amazing to see at night. Lots going on the strip night and day time so make sure to walk around and enjoy.

The M&M and Hersheys places are great to get some chocolates and make sure to visit Ross for cheap branded cloths. 

The key to success is wear comfortable shoes and drink alot of water as it does get hot during the day.",4
Local Flavor,"One of the must do things in Vegas is to walk the strip and see most things Vegas has to offer. 

You can catch anything from crazy people on the streets, random  people  performing,  drunk people, casino shows, Restaurants,  shopping, and more just by taking a few steps. 

Tip from me is to enjoy a nice cold beer while doing it.",5
Local Flavor,"I think Las Vegas, and in particular going to The Strip, is something everyone (21 and older) should do at least once in their lives. It's an experience. Now granted its an experience I've done twice now, and I don't necessarily feel like repeating a third time. I like Vegas, but if I come back again I'd want to spend more time off the Strip, maybe stay on Freemont. That being said here are my likes and dislikes for The Strip. 

- Hotels. All the big ones in Vegas are pretty much here. It's convenient to stay on the strip, and most hotels have free parking. If you don't have a car there are taxis and the public transit bus (The Deuce) that goes down the strip is pretty affordable and easy to use. There's also a free monorail between Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay Bay. - The strip is huge. You can try to walk it all, but I wouldn't recommend it. 

- The airport is pretty close to The Strip, depending on what hotel you stay at. Unfortunately, from what I know, the hotels on the strip don't have free shuttles, but there are shuttle companies that go to the hotels on the strip, and there's taxi service as well. 

- Crazy people. There's always something strange going on. I've heard if you are a guy, or traveling with a guy you'll get accosted more with the showgirl cards. I was traveling with another girl and we were never bothered. Prostitution is technically still illegal here btw. 

- Free entertainment. Vegas can be pricey, but there are lots of free things to check out like the Bellagio fountain show or the Flamingos at The Flamingo, etc. - The themed hotels and casinos are kind of cool to check out, and if it's hot outside (likely) it's a nice break to go inside.

- Booze. If I'm not mistaken you can have open alcohol on the strip. I don't know if this is an official law, or just something that isn't really enforced. That being said having open alcohol on the strip doesn't mean you should get stupid drunk. Police are still around, so try not to do something that will land you in jail (or with a bigger fine than some gambling debt). 

- Entertainment. Most of the casinos on the strip have some sort of entertainment offering, whether it's an exclusive club, a pricey Cirque show or something low key - like a magic act. Check Tix4Tonight for ticket deals. 

- There is some shopping, but it's mostly souvenir stuff. The outlet malls, if that's your thing, are a bit further out. M&M World and the Coca Cola store are a bit fun to browse around in. 

- I did see some families on The Strip, but for the most part this portion of Vegas seems to be catered to adults. If I were a kid I wouldn't really want to come to Vegas, or at least not to the strip. There's not a lot of kids stuff here. 

- One thing I found odd...the costume people dressed up like Spiderman, Minnie Mouse, etc getting their pictures taken on The Strip. First time I was in Vegas (2007) that wasn't thing, last time (2014) it was everywhere. I don't get it. I mean why would I want to have my picture taken with someone in a Spiderman costume. I'm not a kid. It seems kind of stupid, but I noticed a lot of cos people in Times Square in NYC, so it might not be a Vegas thing, just a sign of the times. 

The Strip is fun, but it's also overwhelming and after two trips to Vegas I've seen what I wanted to on The Strip. I might go back to Vegas again, but I'd likely stay and spend more time somewhere else. That said if you haven't been to Vegas definitely check out The Strip, at least for a bit.",4
Local Flavor,"I have a love/hate relationship with the strip. I really do. I hate to even review when I routinely feel like dropping the one-star at my angriest and five-starring when everything is going swimmingly. Love/hate. Alas, as the reigning duke (suck it challengers) I have an obligation to review. 

All or nearly all of the entertainment in my town is concentrated within the strip corridor. Many of the best restaurants are as well. And so are the most obnoxious, apt-to-provoke-homicidal-urges tourists. 

As a local that chooses to spend an inordinate amount of my free time on the strip, I am a part of a minute minority in Clark County. Most locals will make the I-just-got-a-whiff-of-the-Northtown-pig-farm-shit-smell face if you ever invite them to the strip. They want nothing to do with it and may know less about it than a frequently visiting tourist. 

--------------------------------------------------­­­-----------------------

Tourists
There are good ones. However, there are also really, really bad ones. Many of the former need to put in cells, no question about it. Metro and the larger private security force on the strip corridor are very hesitant to do so though, which makes it/them worse (realising they enjoy partial immunity). 

Here are some examples: 
E.g. #1: Drunken idiots jumping into the Conservatory Garden and trampling all of the flora to take a picture of themselves. 

What is done about it? Nothing. 
What should be done? 86-ed from the property forever, and put in a cell until they sober up. Fine heavily.

E.g. #2: Drunken idiots cornering a defenseless exotic bird and beheading it because they are clearly sociopaths.

What is done about it? Slap on the wrist. 
What should be done about it? 86-ed from all properties forever, and put in a cage at High Desert for minimum 1500 days. (Give them proper time to reflect.)
 
E.g. #3: Drunken idiots accost an European tourist's wife. European beats the shit out of drunken idiots. 

What is done about it? Drunken idiots are perceived as victims; European is sent to High Desert to give him time to reflect.
What should be done about it? Drunken idiots should be 86-ed from all properties forever; European should be awarded medal(s) and gift card(s). 

--------------------------------------------------­­­-----------------------

The County Commission 
I don't even want to get that into this merry band of cowboy yokels. They recently banned glass bottles. They cite glass bottle violence  (ha ... haha ... hahahahahahahahaha!) and rubbish in public spaces as reasons for their ban. Hmmmm. 

How about a CDL (bottle bill)? How about you not cite banning bottles on account of concerns with increasing violence considering that deadly firearms are still permitted. How about you clean this place up and knock off the shenanigans (which a CDL would help do overnight)? 

How many times is the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) going to beat the shit out of you in the courts? Have you no shame? Stop wasting our taxdollars. 

--------------------------------------------------­­­-----------------------

Notwithstanding all of the aforementioned, I am still a fan (somehow). 

Rating: Four-stars, ""Yay! I'm a fan.""",4
Local Flavor,"Bright lights, Big City, only not so much. 

All that glitters isn't gold. All that shines aren't stars.  There's so much glitz it's easy to see that it's just make up on an old actress' face. The cracks and crags are often emphasized by the bright shining lights. 

They call it Sin City for a reason, every indulgence is catered to: Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Envy... they're all there, they all reach out to you, tempting you with their whispered promises. Empty promises that in the end are NOTHING but dreams long gone. 

Sure it's a pretty place to visit, Sure it's a great place to people watch, but it's depressing as hell too. The homelessness, the constant bombardment of sensory imput, the hooker cards being handed out on -every corner-, the cars & trucks with lighted advertisements with celebrity faces SO close to yours that you just want to scream. 

I'm glad I don't live there, but I'm happy to visit every so often. 

Here, take my money.",4
Local Flavor,"Ok now to be open and honest I'm happy that I finally made my first voyage out to Vegas and fully experienced it fully!! It's a very overwhelming place with all the LARGE hotels, casinos, world class shopping, world class shows, world class dining establishments... My hubby and I went here for his work- GRC- Global Rally Cross racing- and stayed a couple extra days and when we finally made it home I was sick for over a week!! I wasn't aware that hotels still allow smoking in the rooms regardless that the hotel floors have separate wings- you still smell the smoke everywhere!! Am I glad I finally made the voyage out YES!!! Would I return- not sure!!",4
Local Flavor,"Watching ""The Hangover"" in the beginning you can see the Bellagio Fountains in the background with Kanye West's ""Can't Tell Me Nothing"", this place was even more amazing in person. I came out on a night close to New Years Eve, and the boardwalks were absolutely packed. If you want to catch a glimpse of the show, get there early and stand there. 

Whenever the shows going on, people will be walking in and out of the Bellagio and walking by, make sure you go with a large group of people because it gets a bit sketchy at night at times. Other then that, the night I went, Celine Dion was playing, and the waters were as beautiful as they once were whenever I was a child visiting here!",4
Local Flavor,We just went on a spontaneous vacation get away with my bestie & it was exactly what we needed. Great atmosphere & great time! Defiantly will be going back soon!,5
Local Flavor,"Vegas, I miss you! So overdue for a trip. 

I love Vegas. There are all kinds of people on the strip from all walks of life and different countries. The city is non stop and I love it. There is always something to do. There is always something to see. There is always an idiot to laugh at. 

Vegas has the reputation of being Sin City. Let me be an odd ball and the first to tell you there is more to Vegas than partying, gambling, and drinking. I have been a few times and I never did any of those three. The very first time I went I was pregnant. Then, I've always had my kids. Oh, what a bad mom I am for taking my kids to Vegas! Right?? Vegas isn't kid friendly they say. BS. It is. It's only Sin if you let it be. Of course, I would love to go without my kids and have a drink around my neck, but I can't. So am I just supposed to keep it moving and go to Disney Land? Nope. You go to Vegas and be responsible and don't let the ""sin"" take over. You don't be the parent at 10:00 at night pushing a stroller drunk looking for the baby's bottle you lost. 

Oh, but what about the guys handing out the escort or show girl whatever you want to call the girls cards? What about them? I collected them..lol. Until they recognized me and stop giving them to me. It didn't bother me. Who cares if your kids see them? Okay, so maybe if they are 10+ you may have to explain. 

You can spend your time eating good food and seeing what all the hotels has to offer. From Mandalay Bay's Shark Reef, New York New York's roller coaster, the beauty of the Venetian and the Gondola rides, Bellagio's fountains, Treasure Island's sirens, The Mirage's volcano and Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden Lion and Dolphin habitat, The Flamingo's Wild Life habitat, Planet Hollywood's awesomeness, and Circus Circus' adventure dome and circus acts. Every hotel has something to see and something good to eat. Kids are just not allowed in the casinos. 

There are plenty of PG shows like Le Reve, Jabbawakkees, and The Blue Man group. The Le Reve was an awesome and beautiful show. When I was pregnant we seen the show Freaks. People hanging from hooks and eating glass. My husband's kind of show, but it was cool. I don't think it lasted long in Vegas. Many many tours to go on such as the Grand Canyon. Black Canyon, Vegas by Helicopter, Lake Mead, and more.

Tired of the Strip? Check out Freemont Street. There are plenty of entertainers and performers on the Strip and Freemont Street. Guys painting pictures with just spray paint. If you are tired of walking, you can kick back and relax at the movie theater on the strip. There is the Fashion Show Mall and right down the road from the Strip is an Outlet Mall.

If you get a chance to see outside of the Strip, rent a car. It's somewhat just like every other city outside of the strip. Exactly what we did when we drove there. Went to the malls outside of the strip and ate like a local all while enjoying the Strip. I loved driving there and roaming Las Vegas. Henderson and Boulder City are cute little cities. 

Now, I'm Vegas sick. I am ready to go back!!",5
Local Flavor,Always an incredible experience....,5
Local Flavor,"I've been to vegas enough times to not really care anymore, it is what it is...a big, stupid, shiny, loud, trashy, smelly, sticky, fake, obnoxious, silly, ridiculous, disgusting, drunk filled, hooker infested, sloppy, ugly, steaming, neon waste of money and time....but it's fun if you're seeing it for the first time.

If you are 21 and want to pop your alcohol cherry, by all means go ahead. If you are getting married and want to spend hundreds of dollars forgetting your own name and tipping ""dancers"", then by all means go. If you are 70 years old and love to sit at a slot machine all day, then go.

It's one of those places you have to see once, you just have to see it to believe it. It's one of those things that is just too much of a spectacle not to look at. But seriously, after 2 or 3 visits, it gets real old real fast and there's really nothing new or fun about it. It's the same old thing with different lettering and different colors, that's it. 

Unless you're a professional drunk, professional hooker, or gambling fiend, it's a stupid neon distraction that is good for entertaining you for one night...seriously, get in, get out, and don't come back until your next buddy gets married.

Keep your wallets in your front pockets too...Vegas is the pickpocketing/burglary capitol of the western united states.",2

Local Flavor,"It's a pain in the ass for us locals to drive near the strip thanks over priced concerts, I can download the music for free and have the same effect as a 130 dollar ticket.",1
Local Flavor,"What people lose their nut about is beyond me. The strip is nothing but the bastardized child of Galleria Mall, New Orleans (without the culture, history, charm, or class, but has day drinking), and Chuck E. Cheese's. Everywhere you look is nothing but obnoxious tourists, douchebags, douchettes, and people trying to create a lifestyle that they don't live in their day to day lives. I bet you're saying, ""what's wrong with that, Zan."" What's wrong is that the money you spend in this money pit is the equivalent of going to Italy. You can get a REAL gondola ride versus paying $45-50 for the fake version. That's all this city is. It's a mock up of everything you can experience in real life at the same rate of international travel. Instead of going to the Luxor, go to Egypt. You'll thank me later.",1
Local Flavor,"The strip is where you can see everything that Las Vegas has to offer. From weird people, the hilarious drunks to the many faces of Elvis!
Its never gets boring and allows you to access all of the hotels on the strip easily. There is not much that you cant find on the Las Vegas strip and most of it is free to do.",5
Local Flavor,"On The Strip WALKABOUT is always whats good with a cold brew in hand!


Walkabout: As per Crocodile Dundee: 

A spontaneous journey through the wilderness of one's choosing in an effort to satisfy one's itchy feet, a need to be elsewhere, the craving for the open road, that space over the horizon...yes... something like that... you can't quite touch it so you have to go find it because it's you just know it's there...Or maybe it just feels good to go walking around... 

Everyone takes to The Strip in their own way of awesome walkabout adventures as there is a ton of things to see do & play.

Every visit to Vegas of mine will always consist of a walkabout because it's just awesome that you can walk to soo many different locations with a cold drink in hand playing whatever games of your choosing.

The Strip itself is huge and a few miles is very easily to trek up I definitely would say that I walked at least 20 miles in the few days that I was here which was fun times well spent!

Have fun!
Win Big!
Drink Positive!
Be Safe!
And most of all Walkabout!",5
Local Flavor,"Vegas is a real nice spot. I never got to get on any of the buses during the daytime to see some ass. One night though I was right outside or a block or two away from the MGM grand and after losing most of my money in the casino that night I decided to just walk around and try to clear my head. I stood at a bus stop right there at about 12 midnight, now I knew the buses were not running. Heading in the direction of Excaliber, you know.  I was just sitting there really quick maybe like 4 minutes then a really skinny white girl came up to me. I guess just wanted a chat and I was like nah, not in the mood. I guess that was a hooker spot she offered a blowjob for only 5 bucks. I thought this was my lucky day or something only 5 bucks (lol), honestly I turned it down. I was in such a foul mood of losing my dough. Old school Vegas this was still in the 90's, before Cell phone cams and all that.  I was saying Sin City I guess this is how it is. 

My Last Time on the Strip was 2013. It gets tiresome after a while and this time no crackheads doing offers, but it was still numbers of knuckleheads getting arrested on the strip. I was just here to walk the strip, eat at the Buffet of the Buffets, we were on that time clock and find the cheap booze.  The Strip is fun no matter what age you are.  Advertisting on a saturday night, I guess you can tell but then again maybe not.",3
Local Flavor,"What is there not to like about the Las Vegas Strip!? I can name just one, but before I do I will name all of the things I appreciate the most:

1. The hotels' architecture. 
2. Some of the hotels have shows to watch while standing on the Vegas strip.
3. All of the lights, large video monitors etc.
4. Exotic cars driving by.
5. So many beautiful people.
6. So many weird people.
7. The vibe. People just want to have fun. Period.
8. You can drink alcohol in public on the sidewalk.

What I don't like and wish they could control a bit more:
Those folks standing on the sidewalk trying to hand you a card that directs you to call an escort service. 99% of those cards end up on the ground.

I'm so happy that I live just a quick 3 hour drive from Vegas! I visit at least twice a year.",5
Local Flavor,"Great for people watching, the food, and the hotels. Try the big apple roller coaster at the New York hotel and go see the great shops at the various hotels.",5
Local Flavor,The strip is so interested with every hotel a different theme. I have been to vegas 4 times and i still havent seen everything on the strip. My favorite is the south side of the strip with mgm and New York New York hotel,4
Local Flavor,"It's really not my thing.  I understand that there are people who like it, but I just kept thinking that the Strip's main benefit to me is to attract tourists away from the cities *I* want to visit, rendering them marginally more accessible.

But that's not quite fair.  One thing I do love about the Strip is the profusion of very good public modern art, including pieces by Henry Moore, Maya Lin, James Turrell, and much more.  And of course the reason so much of this art in Vegas is the economics of the Strip itself.  So in a way, if you care about the future of modern art in America, the Strip may well be that future. Wow.",2
Local Flavor,There is nothing quite like the experience of the Las Vegas strip.  The lights... The people... The heat... It's all part of the experience. There are so many things to do... Even if you are not a gambler.  Start on one end and work your way down to the other... You'll be sure to encounter something unique or unexpected.,5
Local Flavor,Why is there so much walking? It took us forever to get to the other side of the strip. I slept 10 hours because of you.,1
Local Flavor,"I have visited Las Vegas for many many years.  I even moved my family to live here for a year and a half.  Nothing beats the strip in sheer magnificence, scale and grandeur.  How amazing to see the Eiffel Tower, buildings of New York, the giant black Luxor pyramid, the dancing fountains of the Bellagio, or the bronze twin towers that are the Wynn and Encore.  I can't wait to come back.",5
Local Flavor,"The Strip is good to see in the day, but it's AMAZING at night. Why you ask? Because it's not 1000 degrees out and everything is lit up! Way better photos at night. The architecture, casinos, exotic cars and street performers all deserves 4 stars.

So here's the skinny. 
- Get a yard from Fat Tuesday or any slushie bar. The cold alcohol makes it better! Yes you can consume this in public!
- Ignore or simply give a firm NO to anyone haggling ya. It's mostly timeshare, escort service and strip club info.
- Do NOT J Walk. The po po takes that serious and you don't wanna get locked up!
- To the ladies rocking heels... Good luck and the streets are clean so you might walk barefoot. It's trendy on the strip lol!
- Save some money and stop in CVS, Walgreens or ABC stores if you'd like cold alcohol or bottles for your room! 
- Dine outside facing the strip so you can enjoy the funny and weird people along the strip!
- Saved the best for last. Be aware of your surroundings. At times the crazies can get out of hand, but everyone is mainly in Vegas to have fun... So enjoy folks!",4
Local Flavor,"Very good at night and don't forget to see the shows: Bellagio, Mirrage. Take your time, because in the evening you can see so much, sometimes you need to step back so that you would not miss anything. Best case there are not so much drunk people. Because we are from germany, hamburg we already have the kiez, that is not the same but this is a place where are so many discos in one street, that las vegas is only interesting because of the shows and that this all is in the middle of the desert.",5
Local Flavor,"WTF do people see in this place??  This is the 3rd time I've been subjected to this miserable dump of a city and somehow it manages to get worse each time.  Buffets are no better than at the Indian casinos in California or New Mexico yet 3x more expensive, the place is littered with bums and trash, and the people are just as miserable as the city.  You can tell the locals who are stuck here hate this place almost as much as I do.  If my company tries sending me here again, I'll seriously either get out of it or quit my job.  I love to gamble but I'll take Reno, California, or the places out East anyday over this miserable hellhole any day of the week.  Can't wait to once again tunnel out of here tomorrow night!",1
Local Flavor,"Not my typical type of place but I enjoyed every moment of roaming down the strip with my crew as we made our way to various clubs, restaurants, and sights in Las Vegas. I understand why locals probably stay away....too many darn people....things....colors....sounds...in one collective space. But it's definitely a beautiful sight for tourist. It's bright, loud, full of countless people, and gives any passerby sensory overload instantly. However, I love the iconic feel of the Strip and loved every minute I spent exploring it during my recent trip to Las Vegas! I'm already plotting another girls trip in the next couple of months and will make sure that I spend more time on the Strip!",5
Local Flavor,"Bright lights, dancing characters, big buildings, sketchy characters! What more can you ask for! Bigger and better than Times Square. Way more casinos than anywhere I've been to in the world. They have buildings mimicking New York, Paris, San Juan and more. Sketchy chinese ladies handing out prostitution flyers (Linda $45 tonight). If you don't have fun in Vegas, there's simply something wrong with you.",5
Local Flavor,"Viva Las Vegas! 
That bright light city set my soul on fire! When you have a lot of money that's ready to burn, this is the place! How I wish that there were more than 24 hours in a day. This place never closes. 24/7 this place is rockin'. They really do turn day into nighttime, and night into daytime. The Strip is the perfect place to do this. All the glitz, the glamour, neon, and words with the letter ""x"" 
The Strip affords the best views of the casinos, with such cool things to do as the Bellagio fountain, and the Mirage volcano. It's a very pedestrian friendly street with walkways that connect you to the various destinations so you don't have to worry about stepping into traffic. 
I love coming here! Even if it costs me my very last dime, and I wind up broke as well, I'll always remember that I had a swingin' time!",5
Local Flavor,"I love the Strip... There, I said it. So many eateries, so many boozieries, so many characters, (some intending to be, some not knowing they are), to take in and eye FUC...

Aside from Bourbon Street, I'm not aware of many places that you can meander up and down the streets of a major metropolis, booze in hand... My kinda place ;-)

The lights in the evening are a feast for the eyes as are the aforementioned characters, from the Transformers to Disney characters, KISS bandmates to WWE Wrestling superstars. (Not to mention a bevy of near naked peeps, both male and female). As Whodini would say... ""The Freaks Come Out At Night"". Go on out and enjoy the show. It's free!!!",5
Local Flavor,This place reeks of shame and cigarettes and suffering. Here for a conference and won't return if  it's in Vegas again.,1
Local Flavor,"Didn't know I can write a review on the Great Las Vegas Strip...been here twice already and still has not been able to walk the whole strip...I love Vegas and it has to offer.  I love the fact theres entertainment everywhere on the strip.  The interaction from people is great like honestly you can have a good laugh and fun with strangers.  

Now Las Vegas has desert heat nothing like Texas heat so it does get hot.  Walking shoes will be smart to wear too.  I had flat open toe sandals and boy my feet were crying.

Enjoy what Vegas have to offer explore the hotels and shops too.  You will discover Vegas is much more than just drunks and strippers",5
Local Flavor,"Well...it's the Las Vegas Strip...the sinner's....mecca...the drinker's resivour....the gambler's haven. It's fun...for awhile. There is tons to do and see, even if you are being good. The street performers are awesome. There's good food and booze to be had. It's definitely the tourists' part of Vegas...and there's nothing wrong with that. Enjoy!",4
Local Flavor,"I don't know why anyone really needs to check Yelp for ""Las Vegas Strip"" but if anyone reads this one day, you gotta come. It's a Vegas feature!

Las Vegas Blvd, known as the Strip is a beautiful place, morning or night. You get a huge gamut of hotels. You can go to Mandalay Bay. You can go to MGM and look at their exhibits, the M&M store is down there as well. Luxor, New York New York. You can ride the tram/Monorail. You also can see Bellagio and their fountains. Celine Dion and Caesar's Palace are also there too, making sure they are the emperors of the Strip. Shop at the Forum Shops. Planet Hollywood has their own shops as well! Bally's and Harrah's, although old, are still here today. Aria/ Vdara/ Mandarin Oriental? are the hotels that make CityCenter, and you can shop and spend your money at that luxorious place. 

Still need more places?

You can visit Wynn/Encore. There's a Premium Outlets there as well. Venetian and the Grand Palace shops are there. Palazzo? Mirage? Treasure Island and their show? Heck, I bet I forgot a lot of the other hotels because there are SO MANY HERE.

One bad thing though is that there is a LOT of traffic. They have 4-5 lanes per direction but somehow traffic still exists here. People walking maybe? Probably. A lot of cars and honking are here as well.

Still not sastified?

There are probably some rooftop clubs and strip clubs here if you do so seek pleasure in Sin City. 

Of course, whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, am I right?",4
Local Flavor,"Die bekannteste Straße von Las Vegas ist sicherlich der Las Vegas Boulevard, der einfach nur ""Las Vegas Strip"" genannt wird. Mittlerweile ist dies das gefühlte Zentrum von Las Vegas, obwohl dieser Bereichsich außerhalb von Las Vegas in den Vororten Paradise und Winchester befindet.

Hier findet man eine beachtliche Anzahl von Hotels und Casinos der Superlative, die einfach nur beeindruckend sind. Wer hier lebt braucht nicht mehr nach Europa, da hier perfekte Kopien von Venedig, Monte Carlo und Paris stehen. Aber auch viele andere Themen wurden eindrucksvoll umgesetzt.

Der Strip beginnt unweit vom ""Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas"" Schild am Mandalay Bay Hotel und endet am Stratosphere Tower, wo wir übernachtet haben. Das sind genau 6,8 Kilometer, die an einem heißen Sommertag sehr lang werden können. Wir hatten uns für unseren Bummel über den Strip bei 40° Grad im Schatten für ein klimatisiertes Auto entschieden, da auf den ersten Kilometern doch eher uninteressante Gebäude stehen.

Entgegen der üblichen Regeln in den USA ist es am Strip erlaubt, Alkohol auf offener Straße zu trinken. An den vielen Wedding Chapels kann man schnell und unkompliziert heiraten. Das ehemalige Zentrum von Las Vegas, das Vergnügungsviertel der Fremont Street, kann hier nicht mehr mithalten.

Der Las Vegas Strip wurde im Jahre 2000 wurde zurecht als Sehenswürdigkeit zur All-American Road ernannt. Einen schönen Überblick kann man sich auf der Aussichtsplattform des Stratosphere Tower verschaffen. Gerade bei Nacht ist es besonders spektakulär, wenn die ganzen Neonreklamen leuchten.",5
Local Flavor,"Let's face it, Vegas is cool.  And the Strip is the coolest place in Vegas.  No where else will you see magnificent structures that is equally gorgeous inside them as well.  There is plenty to do off the strip, but believe me, the strip will keep you happy, busy and in a continual state of disbelief.  It is kind of divided in a few sections.  South strip goes from Mandalay Bay to about about Monte Carlo/Planet Hollywood.  Mid strip goes from there to about the Encore.  North deals with everything from there to around the Stratosphere. The best places day or night is south and/or mid strip.  The best place to stay is mid strip due to the geographic convenience, but most of the hotels are closer to each other making it an easier walk to everything.  Pull out your camera and snap away.  You cannot take enough photos.  Then you go inside; so many great shopping centers, restaurants and wonderful shows.  Oh, then there is this thing called gambling.  It's the only reason everything is there.  You must go to Vegas once in your life and if you do, this is the place to be.",5
Local Flavor,"Vegas is not the same anymore its all quantity no quality left the Police lost their power by NOT enforcing crime  on the strip what I saw in October of 2015 pretty much its just unbelievable and this is  why i dont want to come back to vegas  #1you see black guys pimping young girls on the stip #2  homeless problem everywhere you go #3  half of strip looks like Venice Beach with street  performers #4  you have Mexicans selling beer out of ice box in the corners without license or even asking for ID to verify age  you got people walking down the street smoking marijuana and all this time I have NOT seen one Police Officer on the stip wtf , you know what weed the real  Mafia back this new management is playing  politics they need to stop with this FREE rooms crape if you cant afford Vegas then go to the beach its free",1
Local Flavor,"When people find out we live in LAS they almost always always ask how often we go down to The Strip, answer, every time we have company. If you have never been you gotta go. Something to remember is everything is a lot farther away than it looks. Wear comfortable clothing/shoes and stay hydrated (even in the winter.) The sidewalks are often crowed so just relax and enjoy the journey. In the summer you will often find entrepreneurs on the over crossings selling water. (this is not an authorized activity.) Speaking of winter, it gets really cold in Vegas in the winter...but it is a dry cold. 

Suggestions are City Center, Fountains at Bellagio, Daquri Bar at Coyote Ugly in NYNY. M&M, Coke, Hersheys and anything else that looks interesting. 

During your journey you will likely encounter TimeShare reps wanting to know how long you are in town for. Remember they are just trying to make a living like everyone else, i am always polite and often joke with them. If you are up for a high pressure sales pitch you may want to grab the free show they offer for 3hrs of your time. You will no doubt also encounter the porn slappers. Just keep walking. I ask a police friend why they don't shut them down because prostitution is illegal in Clark County. He said they are not selling prostitution and when you pay the $99 the girl will show up to your room and be offended after you proposition her, storming off. (with your $99...so you do end up getting scr**ed after all.) So just take in the sights, grab an adult beverage (you can drink while walking) and just enjoy yourself.

Local Flavor,"Visiting Vegas without checking out the strip is like visiting NYC and not visiting Times Square.  My last visit to the strip I was with my mom and she enjoyed watching all the ""live entertainment, cartoon characters and the beautiful lights at night."" The strip can be a bit challenging when you have to walk up and down the ""bridges"" to cross the streets.  Definitely wear some comfortable shoes and be prepared to maneuver in and of crowds.  You have easy access to different attractions, restaurants, bars and hotels from the strip. There is a bus that goes up and down the strip to the downtown Vegas area. 

The sad part of this area is just like NYC is the amount of homeless people we saw up and down and near the strip. Some appeared with their crazy and creative signs asking for money and others were just there. If you feel to keep giving, make sure you have a few dollar bills close by. However, even with the big presentation of homeless people, the strip was clean and appeared safe. 
.",4
Local Flavor,"The Las Vegas strip is NOT the place for those who are easily offended, lack any kind of self control (why do you think they make so much money?), or lack the ability to see through the smoke & mirrors

.Remember kids you're NOT here for a bible study, ethics & morals class, and you certainly aren't here for an economics class unless it's a hands on class that teaches you how to rake people over the coals.

You'll see the rich, the poor, luxury, and everything in between. Bargains are far and few between, but it's all relative when you are in a tourist area. 

There is always some kind of hustle going on ranging from street gambling schemes, pan handlers, tawdry advertisements for escort services, strip clubs, bars, etc.. 

Take it for what it is and don't be that pissed off tourist throwing a temper tantrum on the sidewalk.",4
Local Flavor,"It's the Vegas strip where you will always see something new and something different. Every time I go back something changes whether it be a new hotel going up , new shops , or just new acts being featured.",4
Local Flavor,"Crowded, lots of walking, lots of people shoving flyers in your face for their strip clubs. Colorful, magical, upbeat, fun, trendy... the bad doesn't even seem bad; that's how great it is. Lots of cool things to see, even for free.. lots of performers doing cool things. Tons of fun.",4
Local Flavor,"The Strip is simultaneously one of the best and worst things about living in Vegas: it's an amazing concentration of great dining, lots of friends and family visit, there are some of the most talented entertainers in the hemisphere here, and a significant portion of the local population makes their living working in the casinos.

But the traffic! The inflated pricing! The traffic! The smoky, run down casinos, tacky ""street performers"",  scammy dudes trying to hand you escort cards, and homeless people everywhere without resources to get real help! And did I mention the traffic? But when I get frustrated with any of these things I just have to spend a minute wondering what Vegas might look like without the glitz, glamor, and tourist monies generated by the Strip.

Love it or hate it, 99% of people never would have come to Vegas without the Strip.",4
Local Flavor,"Most of people who read this review will not remember the days when organized crime ran Las Vegas, but I was there for the end of ""mob rule.""

In May of 1946, Bugsy Siegel altered an agreement with William Wilkerson (read coerced under threat of death) which eventually gave Siegel and the syndicate control of the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas.  Siegel wanted to provide gambling, food & drink and entertainment at reasonable prices.  A business model the mob used until its dying days in Vegas not only to attract high rollers, but middle class vacationers willing to lose smaller amounts of money at their tables.  Siegel borrowed millions from the syndicate to get the hotel off the ground and the initial results were a failure which caused Siegel to temporarily shut down the Flamingo.  The hotel would reopened in March of 1947 with Meyer Lansky present and started showing a profit.  

This was too little, too late as far as the syndicate was concerned.  In 1946, the syndicate met in Havana, Cuba so an exiled Charles Luciano could attend and the rumored end result was a contract being put out on Siegel.  Siegel had also told associates he was running a ""California syndicate"" on his own and he would repay the loans in his own time.  On June 20, 1947, Siegel was gunned down at the home of his girlfriend and the crime went unsolved.

I can still remember the first time I saw ""The Strip"" and the billions of bulbs lighting up the night sky.  It made for a very exhilarating experience.  Today, it is bathed in neon and the feeling just isn't the same:

( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-strip-las-vegas-4?select=JoTS9yZ0uvmebTt4ISp3Sw )

Most of the hotels I remember from my first days visiting ""The Strip"" are gone, but The Flamingo ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-strip-las-vegas-4?select=zXOH3W4hcQrdAinFPmdH-Q ) and Caesars Palace still stand.  

I am not saying ""mob rule"" was better than the corporate model of today, but it was definitely different.  If there was a vagrant population, it was hidden for the most part, but today ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/las-vegas-strip-las-vegas-4?select=yY4gIcD4wa_UgbJe-sbw-A ) the homeless are everywhere with the exception of hotel property.  In addition to the vagrants, the scam artists are out in full force.  People peddling timeshares, free limousine rides (to places the drivers are paid to take you) and free show tickets (wonder why these shows are free?).  If the mob was still running Las Vegas, anyone trying to hustle this stuff would have ended up in an alley with a ""Columbian Necktie"" for their trouble.  When I first walked the strip, the only peddling I saw involved strip clubs and prostitution (which were controlled by the mob).  

Another notable difference were the employees.  Criticize the mob all you want, but they took care of their employees.  Good wages, health care and retirement plans were available for all hotel and casino employees.  The result was practically every worker I met having a smile on their face and friendly personalities.  In the corporate Vegas, these smiles and friendly workers are far fewer.  If I was at a table or a one armed bandit in my early days, when my drink was empty there was always a waitress asking if I needed another.  The drinks were also strong (splash of Coke with my rum).  The drinks I had during this trip were either nicely balanced or void of alcohol and the servers few and far between for the most part.  Another huge difference were the uniforms.  The mob understood sex sells and if it was the toga wearing girls at Caesars or the low cut blouses and high skirts at the Barbary Coast (R. I. P.), there was plenty of eye candy for the guys!  

Rohlinism:  Give a man a free drink and he will stay until it is finished.  Give a man a drink in a low cut blouse and he will stay until he passes out!

The uniforms today are pretty nondescript, the cream colored one pieces at Caesars needs a particular figure to pull off and most of the women wearing it lacked said figure.  Not to mention the short cape reminded me of Elvis circa 1970's.  Bleh!

The corporate Vegas has improved the hotels and food, but the mob wanted all your money at the tables, so they would have never contracted a Gordon Ramsay or Wolfgang Puck to open a restaurant in their hotels.  They gave you a $1.99 steak and egg breakfast so you could cheaply sustain yourself and return to the casino.  The mob didn't make hotel rooms fancy cause if you are in your room, you aren't in the casino giving them your money.  My wife recently stayed at the Venetian and felt obligated to spend time in the room because it was so nice and sooooooo expensive.

For others, the corporate Vegas may be a splendid thing, but I find myself longing for the days when the mob ran the town!",3
Local Flavor,"There is no place for elderly or handicapped to sit or for others to rest.  Many say because of the homeless the city had to remove all possible seating fixtures.  They also have aggressive street performers that don't really perform they just stand there in costumes; transformers, minions, women in bathing suits and wings, etc.  They want $10-$15 to take a photo.  They will block your passage to form a crowd to attract ""suckers"" to get ripped off and some say this is ripe for pick pockets.  These ""performers"" belong on Fremont Street.  The hotel owners need to bring the CLASS back to the strip.",3
Local Flavor,"A CHRISTMAS &  HOLIDAYS EDITION REVIEW

   The Las Vegas Strip is a special place that I had reserved for a landmark review. After the joyful times that the Strip gave me for Christmas this year, I am going to share a landmark Christmas adventure that this review will lead you on. This adventure begins at Mandalay Bay and follows the west side of the Strip  into the Fashion Show Mall at the northernmost point, then takes you into the Wynn and South into the MGM Grand where it concludes. This is an adventure through the Winter Wonderlands of the mega resorts and public spaces. This review will be themed as a hike. The only flaw is some grammar errors to avoid the Yelp character limit. 

Mandalay Bay to Fashion Show:

   The adventure begins at the  Mandalay Bay lobby where a Christmas tree stands against the backdrop of the beach. From here the hike leads into the luxor where Christmas trees hug a spyinx. An escalator overlooks a Winter Wonderland lobby. Leaving the luxor, Christmas wreaths border the people mover with a Christmas tree on the right. Now in the Excalibur the hike leads to 3 Xmas trees by the rotunda & one at the lobby. 

   NY-NY has a nice Xmas tree by the lobby with a few surprises including the doughnut Xmas Tree at America. 

  Now outside on a cool December day, the walk leads to a towering Nutcrackers & Xmas Tree guarding the Monte Carlo. This is the time to take a warm coffee break in a Christmas themed Sambalatte. 

  There is little in Monte Carlo, & the next stop is Crystals. I recommend doing a circle taking in the large Xmas tree, the small Xmas trees & public art. From here you enter the Aria where the lobby goes out for Christmas. Inside the Aria, Jean Philippe presents a chocolate Grinch. From here you'll turn right where you pass a reigndeer at the exit. Now you continue toward the Bellagio. 

  The Bellagio Conservatory is the highlight. One word describes it: Breathtaking (fighting character limit). From the Bel., you want to exit at the lobby &  walk along the Lake. Chances are you'll catch the fountains show. Now at the Strip, you want to take a short detour into the Cosmopolitan and up to the pool deck to see the ice rink. 

  Back on the Strip, head to Caesar's. There are a couple of Xmas trees. The wreath bordered hall of the Forum shops offers jolly window displays. 

  The Mirage Atrium turns into a Winter Wonderland with frosty dolphins and snowmen. 

  Even T.I. gets into Xmas with a couple Xmas trees. 

  Inside Fashion Show you reach the north pole of the hike. Here Shriek & friends pose in front of the Ave. to Santa house. This is a good stop for a meal or coffee at the E Bar. 

The Wynn to MGM Grand :

   Now on the east side of the Strip, you want to hike into the Wynn to see Steve Wynn's touch on the Holidays. 

   The Palazzo Waterfall Atrium is a Winter Wonderland leading into the wreath decorated Grand Canal Shops where you can enjoy Christmas in Venice. 

   The next stop is the Linq where the Promenade is a jolly Christmas lane. There is a Christmas performance at night & all day a Xmas Tree stands against the High Roller not far from 2 Christmas decorated Flamingos.

  The Bazaar Shops offer a unique view of a menoroah & Xmas Tree with the Eiffel Tower. 

  In Paris, the main Christmas display is the tree in the lobby. I don't recommend walking Bally's & most of Paris. 

  The adventure concludes in the MGM Grand where Leo the Lion is decorated for Christmas with a rodeo hat. Now you can say, ""roar."" You completed a landmark Christmas adventure. 

Final Notes: There is so much more to write but there is a character limit. I might review other businesses separate. Another decision I had to make was to place the pictures with the appropriate businesses. I intend to keep this Christmas edition review up to at least January 2017.",4
Local Flavor,"2016 NYE was pretty interesting.

Much like 2015 NYE in South Beach, the main strip was closed for the evening.  However, I was a bit surprised that it was not closed for the entire day or the following day.  I guess South Beach does a bit more hanging out...

This strip is a big mish-mosh of clutter that leads to sensory overload.  However, people clearly flock to this place.  I don't much care for the smutty solicitors of ""girls, girls, girls,"" but I guess everyone has to make a living.  The beggars are also off-putting, but that should give everyone reason to take pause and contribute to someone else's well-being.  But what I really don't understand is why so many families bring their children (and even young babies) to this place.  I don't know that Vegas is (or ever was) a family destination.  The experience of children running a muck in casinos, babies crying during my dinner, and seemingly being attacked by strollers is not what I consider a vacation for myself.  But to each his own, and I gotta share this planet with someone.

Be careful of this deceiving strip:  while destinations seem close, walking can be a beast and take far, far longer than expected.  As a pedestrian, you also need to pay close attention to the walk signs and follow them accordingly.  Traffic can be a bit tricky, but if everyone acts responsibly, things will go well.

In short, the strip is the strip...",3
Local Flavor,"For my 300th review I'm Yelping about the Vegas Strip. I can't seem to get enough of that place. You'll never run out of things to do. The hotel and resorts are spectacular with a multitude of things that will keep you busy. Vegas isn't really for kids, but on the Strip, there's Circus-Circus and the Excalibur. On the very bottom floor of the Excalibur, they have a game room for kids. They just gave my son stuffed animals when he played the games, whether he won or not, lol.

My favorite things to do are shopping and eating. There's no better place for me to hang out at than on the Strip. There's an abundance of both. The Fashion Show Mall and The Miracle Mile Shops are two of my favorites. You can find anything and everything that you're looking for at those two spots. If not, there is also the Caesar Forum Shops, on the pricier end. 

If you like shows, almost every hotel on the Strip has some kind of show going on. Since all the hotels are so close together, you can catch one show right after the next. Some of the shows happening now are Michael Jackson One, Le Reve The Dream, Zarkana, The Beatles Love, David Copperfield, Ka, and Criss Angel.

At night, when the Strip lights up, it's breathtaking. Some of the things I did on the Strip this time around: 

1. Fountains of Bellagio Watershow
2. Eiffel Tower at Paris
3. Gondola Ride at Venetian
4. Volcano at the Mirage
5. Criss Angel at the Luxor

I also went on the High Roller Ferris Wheel. It technically isn't on the strip, but if you go on that, you get a great view of the Strip. It's 550 foot-tall and is the world's tallest Ferris wheel.",5
Local Flavor,"Where all the Vegas magic happens. When you get some good weather make sure to take a stroll down it. May take a while, but there are so many hotels, attractions and great places to shop and eat.",5
Local Flavor,"I get it.  Many straight guys will spend any amount of money to get laid, and there are plenty of beautiful women waiting to get pampered and drunk.  They meet here at this mecca.  For me, this is a huge complex designed to bilk the willing of their dollars.  I moved from Oregon to LA and the LV Strip makes LA seem not only affordable but living at a discount by comparison.  With every swipe of a card or selection of any product or service you can expect to pay a $2-$10 premium per item for spending your money at loud, dark, meandering venues full of drunk horndogs and the hos craving their attention.  I have met more people with success playing lottery tickets than gambling here.  And I know far more people who have gambled here.  I think it has changed in recent years for the worse.  Whether it is a soft drink, taxi, beer or a FAX, it is fully normal here for things to cost double what you pay anywhere else but maybe Manhattan.  There are fewer people handing you porn ads on the sidewalks, replaced by more people separating you from your money legally.  Bleh. Leaving early.  Everything here is available in any big city but for much less.  I am not in this venue's target market.",2
Local Flavor,"Vegas Statement...
I have to start off my stating information for ""families"" and not singles and couples...OK?  All the advertising pitching Vegas as a family vacation area is crap, BS, full of holes. This is SIN (SCAM) City folks, plain and simple, I know it, you know it, so don't act coy if you bring your family here. Smoking is allowed every where here, in-door malls, bathrooms, all large casino hotels, etc. So if you're a non-smoking family, get ready. Also, open alcohol consumption is allowed every where as well. Pan handlers are every few feet apart along every single walking path that any tourist would take. Either ignore them or bring a stack of ones. Just stating facts. Being out on the strip when the sun goes down is not the same as where you're from. The locals come out and the hash tag should be: #craziesRout. If you don't want your kids being exposed to the deep reaches of the minds black hole, head back to the hotel.

Prices. The prices of everything in Vegas has shot up 20 fold in the past 3 years. There are no $1 dollar steaks or $1 buffets to be had. A bottle of water is anywhere from $3.50 to $7 on the strip. ""Gouging Tourist"" should be the new city motto!   

Family things to do. I highly suggest you call around to check on events daily. Don't have your heart set on doing 1, 2, 3 in that order or for that matter, that day. Why?  We did and got burned. 

Welcome to Las Vegas Sign (A Must Do!) ""https://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/welcome-las-vegas-sign/""  This is cheesy but hey, you came to Vegas with your family. Go, and have fun!  

Harley Davidson Showroom at 5191 S Las Vegas Blvd (Gotta Go!) This one is walking north after you take photos at the Welcome to Las Vegas Sign. They have an attached convenience store with cool trinkets and reasonable prices on everything from Ts to water to single beers. It's extremely clean and even kids will appreciate all the shiny bikes. Hey, you're doing cheesy so go all out! Note: if you want to rent a bike for a day, or several days, they can accommodate you. As for their prices...WOW...ridiculously high.

Local Flavor,"All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend.

Good cocaine, hobos sleeping on the sidewalk outside Bellagio, and racist Pokemon card dealers. Life is cray on The Strip.

That said, the strip is also an incredibly cool place to walk. Endless sights and all sorts of characters everywhere you look. I was lucky enough to walk the strip on a cool winter's night. The lights were all lit up and the brisk night air was alive with that Vegas atmosphere. It was absolutely one of the most memorable experiences of my life, thus far. Nothing that I have experienced is even close to how awesome it was on the strip. And I didn't even walk the whole thing!

Though there were a lot of families out, walking the strip, it's not really someplace that I would take my kids (same goes for Vegas in general, to be honest), due to all of the aforementioned (not so PG) colorful characters. Of course, if you do, it's certainly something that they're bound to remember. Just don't let them get their hands on any of those ""Pokemon"" cards that they hand out there.

All in all, walking the strip will always be one of the standout memories of my time in Vegas. Whether you're in Vegas for business or pleasure, I'd make it a point to get out and walk the strip at least once.

On a side note, it really helps to share pockets on those chilly winter nights! That was one of my favorite parts of walking the strip!",4
Local Flavor,"This strip is very famous... You have to beware as there are lots of people and some not so nice... It is safe to walk around as there is security Round, but there are some places where the amount of people and the tight spaces, makes it seem not so safe... You can walk from hotel to hotel and shop around as well... 
Enjoy",4
Local Flavor,"The Strip is what it is: a perfect representation of Sin City. The glitz and glam of the casinos mixed with piles of trash, drunk and homeless people, and shameless buskers doing whatever they can for a buck. Honestly, I do my best to stay indoors. The streets are crammed at all hours (except early in the mornings) and it can often be so incredibly difficult to get around. Don't even try to drive down there if you're expecting to get anywhere fast!",3
Local Flavor,what can I say it's Vegas to much booze food and what ever else you want I always have a good time even thou I don't gamble,5
Local Flavor,"Avoid the strip at all costs. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.

Every time I go there, I regret it.
And now that paid parking is approaching, it's even more unappealing.

The strip is absurdly expensive due to revenue-sharing between the businesses and the casinos (about 1/3 of what you pay goes to the casinos), and it's full of mostly trailer-trash in shorts and flip-flops, and overweight Taylor Swift wannabes awkwardly walking around with what seems like concrete blocks for shoes, all pretending to ""live the dream"".

For those who have a brain, that ""dream"" is nothing short of a nightmare.

There are so many wonderful restaurants, shops, and forms of entertainment off-the-strip that are more worthwhile....especially in Chinatown....just do a little research....starting here on Yelp.",1
Local Flavor,Free entertainment. Lots to see. Lots of walking exercise. Great hotel architecture. A variety of restaurants.  Lots of tourists.,5
Local Flavor,"I defiantly have to say, it has improved over the passed year! I was going to give is a 3.5 but unfortunately, there is no half so I did round up because it seems like there are a few more positives then negatives. 

Last year I would have given it a 1 star nothing more. The sidewalks were horrible and trash beyond trash everywhere. So a bit nervous to come this time. Unsure what to expect. 

This time (March2016) the sidewalks were much cleaner. There was no boarded off sidewalks. The people passing around X rated pictures tried to avoid families with kids but still standing strong with couples. 

Walking the strip, all I have to say is wear comfortable shoes. Very comfortable!!! Break up the strip in sections. ( my experience was walked the whole strip in 5 hours from one side Luxor to the other circus circus ) making a  few stops I between (Bellaggio garden, Caesars Atlantis, circus circus few games, and the mile mall inbetween) well is was about 16 miles we walked and just so happens super windy and light sprinkling. Near bother me much. But my feet and my families hurt so bad that even the next day they were sore. My hubby even got a huge blister in the middle bottom of his foot.) So be prepared, make frequent stops and rest those precious feet! 

Also the strip is doing continuous constructions. However, the one recommendation I do want to give is DO NOT WALK all the way to circus circus. That place is not worth it. That place is a smelly dump.",4
Local Flavor,Yay! I get so excited when I think of The Strip! The casinos and night life are amazing! People are plentiful and meeting tourists is so fun! I love the choice of shops and places to eat on the Strip!,5
Local Flavor,"The Las Vegas Strip is very tiring to walk from one end to the other. Don't make the mistake of thinking you can do it. If you are staying at a hotel, book one in the middle or else your legs will feel like they are going to fall off. Especially if you have little legs like mine!

I like the bling bling on the strip. It looks like how it looked back 15 years ago, back in 2010, change is moderate speed. Last time I went which was December 2015, I did noticed a few new casinos popped up. Only issue is air quality in the winter is not as great as in the spring or fall. I don't recommend summer time, it could be super crazy and hot. Yes Burning Hot. Las Vegas is located in a desert.

One thing that bothers me is the truck with advertising board driving super slow on the strip. yes I do understand, its their way of advertising for other business. But it does hold up traffic. There is a monorail but its limited to certain hotels. 

At night time, there are a few things happening on the strip like Mirage volcano show or Treasure island pirate show etc. But they all seem to start around the same time. 

It is definitely a good tourist location to be in. I did enjoy my stay.",4
Local Flavor,"Always a good time and has been for several decades.

I've been coming here as a child and as an adult and have always enjoyed the glitz and glamor of the World Famous Las Vegas Strip.  It's definitely the place to see and be seen. It has evolved many times from being the adult Disneyland to being more family oriented to back to being the adult Disneyland. 

The waves change every ten years and so does the profitability of the strip.

When the economy is running on all cylinders there are high occupancy levels and gaming revenues. When the economy is slow you'll find less people and more homeless people on the walkways and streets.

With the closing of several iconic hotels to make way for openings of newer and more lavish mega resorts I've come to enjoy the transitions.  Being able to pinpoint where establishments used to be and what they are now makes me feel old and nostalgic.

The Las Vegas Strip has always been the iconic place to visit when you turn 21,22,102! 

So much to see and so much to do in so little time.  

From binge drinking, boxing, buffets, concerts, fine dining, gambling shopping, to sight seeing, UFC - whatever you want to do, you can and at any time of the day or night. You can do it by foot, car, monorail or simply by sitting in your room.

Something about Las Vegas and the strip still entices me to come back and always yearning for more. I've vowed to stay in every hotel on the strip as well as downtown before I kick the bucket. I've amassed many room keys and do not disturb signs as well as a few matches. Consider it hoarding... But I want to be able to tell my grandkids that I've been here and there and this is my proof of the good times I've had in Vegas.

Whether your rich or broke attractive or ugly- it doesn't matter in Vegas. When you're here you own the world even if it's only for a weekend.

Do yourself a favor and visit more frequently! 

See you around. Cheers!",5
Local Flavor,"Duh! Isn't this why we come to Vegas. The Strip! 

I love Vegas, so I love the Strip!",5
Local Flavor,"Vegas neverrrr gets old. Epic moments of a lifetime. This is my 4th time visiting this year. I Love people watching, walking on the strip, the gambling, world class restaurants, beautiful hotels, and of course the nightlife and clubs. I Stayed at the encore, Wynn, palazzo and the Venetian. Want to try Aria or Bellagio next",5
Local Flavor,"This big street in the middle of nowhere is awesome. This is one of the best places i have been. Here is life 24/7. So many different people. The hotels were so big and so beautiful on their own way. We have started the day by beginning in the lowest way of the street, at Mandalay Bay. After that you will pass New York New York, MGM Grand, Luxor, Aria, Bellagio, Paris, Ceasar Palace, Flamingo, Mirage, Venetian, Wynn and Encore and Treasure Island. Every hotel has their own speciality. We have been to the show Mystere by Cirque du Soleil in the Treasure Island. A great experience to see this show. We have also been to a show of David Copperfield in the MGM Grand hotel. If you have time to see some shows in the evening it is a must do ! The streets were very clean. The only minus was the southern American people on the street who asked you for stripclubs and bars. Every 10 meter. I really want to go back to the Strip !",5
Local Flavor,"What an overrated city that so many people spend their wasted time in. The city of Las Vegas is known and popular for one thing gambling, my guess would also be prostitution. 

Everywhere you turn, you see desperate females throwing themselves on older men. Young what used to be beautiful women passing out their ""sex-cards"" to potential lovers. 

Psssh, what a pathetic city that used to have so much to offer. The city of lights as some would say, but the city that never slept as what I'd seen. 

Sinful city as the Christians would call it, or the place that Tupac was killed. So much history was placed into this mysterious wanderlust city. 

My main objective coming to Las Vegas was to enjoy my visit and explore the mountains, I did just that. 

If you are like me and don't care too much for gambling, then Las Vegas isn't for you. 

It was truly beautiful to sightsee all of the big bright hotels and their fountains, but like everyone walking through them, it gets old quick. 

You think there's a lot of people cluttering the streets of NY? Think again, those same people are here too, most of them looking to pick-pocket you and have you look like the dummy when the check comes. 

The job industry sure does please most residents cause you can either work for a casino or hotel, your pick. 

But what the heck, like all cities there comes no perfection, just residents trying to make a living and tourists trying to find the ""best"" spot to relax.",3
Local Flavor,"Although most of the party life happens after the sun goes down, you will get a good appreciation of life's ups and downs if you take a walk along The Strip during the day. There is little shade (apart from inside shops) but there's plenty to see. The central strip from The Venetian to MGM Grand will probably take about 40 minutes to walk, but there's a lot of distractions along the way. I enjoyed the shopping - particularly in the Miracle Mile, Caesar's Palace Forum and Venetian shops. The crowds are easy to navigate during the day but in the weekends and at night it's a lot busier.",3
Local Flavor,Everyone should see the strip at least once. It's too large to do in one day. We stopped here on our way home from a road trip so we just stayed a couple hours. It may not be for everyone but it is worth seeing.,4
Local Flavor,"Gamblers paradise! Casinos, buffets, gun shops, hookers, strip clubs, alcohol, tattoo shops, clubs, shopping, marriage chapels, tours, shows, anything you can think off you will find on or near the strip. This is an adult's disneyland, so leave the kids at home!",4
Local Flavor,"The Las Vegas Strip is just a whole different planet. An unknowing person would be able to see alien species walking all around. I have never been to a place that was better for people watching. There is no telling who, or what, you will walk past next. At any point you may encounter costumed characters, superheroes, Michael Jackson, drunk bachelor parties, people high as kites, slutty cops, bright flashing lights, artists, pimps and escorts, Elvis, showgirls, sports cars, people who shouldn't be wearing that, brides and grooms, homeless disabled panhandlers, fire, fountains, and Wonders of the World...The Las Vegas Strip has it all...And more!

Though, for so many of the people I encountered, I truly hope that what happened here, stayed here...",5
Local Flavor,"Tons Of Pokestops in the Mandalay Bay all threw out the property
From Casino floor to Shark Reef to the Pool area and many other stops! Have fun and be safe Pokemon Hunters!",5
Local Flavor,"Nothing too special, but I would definitely recommend walking down the strip at night when all the lights are on! It makes everything prettier. Cool theme across some of the hotels; I would definitely recommend checking out Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, and Venetian. Cool themed hotels!",4
Restaurants,"I hate to slag on this place since their location on West Flamingo is one of my go to spots.  But I gotta call it like I see it.  

For reasons I won't go into..I'm vegetarian for the month of January.  I am pretty much hating it so far and I'm only 5 days in but I figured I would try this place out since they offer a few things the W.Flam location doesn't.  These things include gyros, beef shawarma and FALAFEL.  

I got the falafel plate since the only alternative was a ""falafel burger"".  I would've ordered a falafel sandwich w/ pita had that been a choice.  

The atmosphere is pretty much set up for people on the go.  I imagine people on conventions might get a quick bite here.  Drunk bastards/bitches would be fine here since they're open til 3am daily and all their furniture is plastic.  

So I was a bit excited when they brought out my plate.  4 huge falafel balls along with the usual things Shish Kabob House offers like the roasted pepper and tomato.  But they don't include salad at this location and the rice isn't as good here.  

My excitement completely died as I had my first bite .  Dry, bland..almost like eating an overdone oatmeal raisin cookie and it kinda crumbled like it too.  They also served a side of super thick kinda tzatziki sauce which didn't go too well with it.  I would have much rather had tahini or hummus but I am not shelling out $4.95 for a side order of it.  Really unsatisfying.  

I have no question that their kabob menu is just as excellent as the original location but they shouldn't be serving falafel here.  The W. Flamingo location is better to go to..ambiance (even though they use folding tables), side salad with your entree and music from their country as opposed to Fuse TV playing at the strip location.

I might be back here...but it'll only be for LAMB CHOPS!!!",2
Restaurants,"There was a sweet lady behind the counter with the cutest accent.  She was helpful in recommending a combo plate since it was our first time there.  My co worker and I ended up getting the combo plate...it had pork chops, beef lula, regular beef and chicken.  On top of a large bed of rice.  Oh man, just $12 for this hearty carnivorous meal.  Comes with a grilled tomato and jalapeno for garnish.  I was only able to eat half.  Service was fairly quick.  We got ours to go, but atmosphere is fun and colorful.  If my feet didn't hurt, I wouldn't have minded eating there.  That day, I just wanted to get home in a hurry.",4
Restaurants,"Nice place on the strip. Not expense at all (most, if not all meals are around the $10 price point). Good kabobs. Plate come with a choice of fries, salad or rice. Alot of food for the price. The jalapenos are fiery! Be warned!",4
Local Flavor,"Ce quartier est l'un des plus anciens de la ville, là où ce sont installés les premiers colons. On y retrouve d'ailleurs une architecture typique et d'adorables ruelles pavées. Côté boutique, ce sont plutôt des galeries d'art et des antiquaires et bien sûr de très nombreux restaurants. Le quartier est idéal pour une balade, que ce soit à pied ou dans l'une des fameuses calèches. Vous pourrez aussi vous promenez sur le vieux port juste à côté. Je vous recommande de faire le musée de Pointe-à-Callières qui explique merveilleusement bien la création de la ville et également à la saison chaude, la balade « Les fantômes du vieux Montréal »...
Si vous envisagez de vous établir ici, sachez que les loyers sont particulièrement élevés...",4
Local Flavor,"Petit, peut être un peu trop petit d'ailleurs, ce petit musée situé juste a coté de l'entrée de la banque de Montréal nous montre en détail l'évolution de la monnaie canadienne :)


 Par contre, ne manquez pas le hall d'entree principale de la banque! Magnifique!! ;)",3

On y trouve pas mal de restaurant sympathique et des magasins pour touristes.

Local Flavor,"Bien que ça soit un endroit extrêmement touristique, en même temps, il y a tellement de recoins cachés et qui valent la peine d'être découvert dans le Vieux Montréal, donc je ne peux pas m'empêcher de lui donner une assez bonne cote. C'est l'endroit parfait pour des ballades en amoureux, ou même pour y passer une journée ensoleillée en famille avec un pique-nique tout près du Vieux-Port. C'est rempli d'histoire et avec les anciens bâtiments de pierre, on peut facilement s'imaginer comment c'était ""dans l'temps"". Les amateurs d'arts seront comblé vu le nombre et la variété des galeries d'arts qui y sont, la plupart cachées entre une boutique de souvenirs quétaines et un resto qui dit faire la meilleur poutine authentique du Québec! L'hiver, les décorations de Noël donnent un air féérique à la rue Saint-Paul, puis l'été, l'accès de cette rue est réservée aux piétons et donne l'impression de vivre dans un grand village où tout le monde est en vacances.",4
Local Flavor,"I Adore the Old Port of Montreal. I don't care that there's too much tourist and that it's full of Restaurants that are overpriced. I got some of my best memories there. There use to be the Just for Laugh festival there: Way better place in my opinion.  Same thing around X-mas with the winter activities. Even though in the beginning of the 2000's they made renovation it's still pretty authentic and didn't lose his nice feeling to it. There's lot of Statues, lot of them created by Louis-Philippe Hébert an ancestor of my friend who's also an artist . He created lot of historical figures of the 1700-1800's Montreal important people.  I like St-Paul with their Art Gallery, The Pointe-A-Calliere Museum that pretty much every elementary school visited at least once. The huge clock with like 250 ish step and the Canon just close, enough to make every kid feel happy being surrounded by thing that make BOOM. Place Jacques Cartier with they public entertainers and the City Hall (that's quite a piece of History too). In front there's one of the oldest house (350 yrs) and the old wall surrounding the city during wars with the Natives. McCord Museum, nothing that's soo wow for me but still. George-Etienne Cartier's Museum pretty a Federal institute with old time dressing and acting. Crèmerie de l'Érablière, nice place to eat a ice cream cone in Summer times. Les Trois Pierrots, a place that play folkloric and popular music. You need to go once: you end up hating it or loving it: Nice for parties.  The Gizillion Steakhouses. The Labyrynthe and IMAX that's now a Science & Technology museum or something like that. The Centaur Theatre, the only or one of the only anglo Theatre and a Architecture jewel of Old Port. Really Old Port of Montreal is Beautiful and IT IS understable that it would be such a big tourist place. I just love the fresh smell of Fleuve St-Laurent in the Summer and the Ice Skating ring in Winter. Cool place!


Moi J'ADORE le Vieux Port. J'm'en fous qu'il y ait plein de touristes et que ça soit plein de resto OK qui vendent trop cher. J'ai des souvenirs inoubliable: L'époque ou le Festival Juste Pour Rire était dans ce coin c'était la belle époque. Même chose pour les hivers avec les activités de traineaux de chien, le look du Vieux-Port est vraiment superbe et malgré les rénovations, ça a garder un côté authentique. Les statues un peu partout de Louis-Philippe Hébert (un Aieuil d'un de mes amis aussi artiste) et les monuments historique. Un coin qui s'étale assez longtemps. Les Boutiques d'Arts sur Saint-Paul. Le Musée de la Pointe-A-Callière qu'on a tous visité quand on était des petits culs du secondaire. L'Horloge avec ces quoi, 225-250 quelques marches et les Canons: De quoi énervé n'importe quel petits gars qui aime les trucs qui font BOOM. La Place Jacques Cartier avec ces amuseurs publiques et L'Hôtel de Ville. Pas loin en face on a la plus vieille maison de plus de 350 ans avec un Musée. Le Musée McCord ,qui m'énerve pas le poil des bras mais tout de même important à souligné. Le Musée de George-Étienne Cartier: un chichi du fédéralisme avec un certain charme pour les amateurs de musée-acting; parfait pour les petites madames. Puis la Crèmerie de l'Érablière puis Les trois pierrots. Une place qui existe depuis que mes parents sont au monde qui est une boîte à chanson qui faut au moins faire une fois (on aime ou on hait après). Les Trillions de Steakhouse sur St-Paul.  Le LABYRINTHE pis le IMAx qui est rendu le Musée des sciences des technologies ou de quoi du genre. Le Centaur Theatre, un des seuls Théatre anglophone vraiment magnifique. Très vieillot. L'hiver la Patinoire. L'été les marches ensoleillées avec une bouffée d'air du Fleuve. Vraiment pas juste un endroit touristique pour rien! C'est juste vraiment bien comme endroit.",5
Local Flavor,"Although it is incredibly touristy, you can't deny the beauty of old montreal. In the summer it is the perfect place to just walk around, find a terrace and have a drink with a friend. It's also a great spot to watch the fireworks, or to go for a bike ride along the water. In the winter it is a little dead, but there is always a great cozy restaurant to eat at",5
Local Flavor,"NIce cobblestone streets, street performers, local artists, great food, great sightseeting....it is one of the prettiest areas of a city in North America.....lots of French flair.    You can get there by foot, metro, bus, car, bike, etc...nice and convenient to downtown Montreal...",4
Local Flavor,"I'm always impressed at visiting Old Montreal, a neighborhood that's almost 400 years old. so much to do, see, eat, and drink!

here, you can find an amazing variety of culture: science and history museums, cafes, boutiques, farmers markets, pubs, art galleries, historic buildings and monuments, live music, street performances, restaurants, churches, and more. 

cobblestone roads, many of which are closed off to car traffic, make walking around the ideal way to see it all and soak in the glory. quite a few metro and bus lines stop nearby; my recommendation is to  take the metro to Champ de Mars and walk south.

most importantly, it manages to cater to tourists and locals alike without being condescending to either. if only Times Square could do that instead of just being a flashy cesspool of overpriced chain shopping - yeah, I said it!

hot tip: on New Year's Eve, it's a great place to watch the fireworks from Place Jacques Cartier.",5
Local Flavor,"Le Vieux Montreal offers so much to see and do.  Best part of it all is a lot of it doesn't cost a single penny!  The views are stunning, the skies are always blue and just about everything is beautiful.  The cobblestone roads give it the most character & the people are very friendly.  Definitely a very memorable experience.",5
Local Flavor,"I don't tend to hate on other Yelper's reviews but really, how can you not give Le Vieux Montreal five stars?! I'm questioning your review skills all of yous who deemed this historic center and old port four stars. 

For those who've never been, Le Vieux Montreal is the old part of Montreal consisting of an area made up of cobblestone streets, amazing restaurants and ever so hip pubs and bars, the St. Lawrence River, museums, beautiful old churches, European architecture, art galleries, and so many more uncovered gems. I have spent days walking along these streets and enjoyed every second of it. I have yet to be during the summer but, even in dead of winter, with snow blanketing everything, and the cold numbing your face, I can't imagine a more special place in a North American city. You fall in love with everything around you. Yes, it can be touristy but, that's because it's f*%&$* amazing. 

J'adore Montreal, j'adore le Vieux Montreal.",5
Local Flavor,"Je suis passé la première fois pas le vieux Montréal sans même savoir que j'étais dans ce quartier. En effet c'est tout petit. Donc après avoir fait quelques minutes de marche j'ai fait demi-tour pour retourner voir le vieux Montréal. 

Bon il n'y a pas grand-chose à voir sauf peut être l'architecture qui est sympa mais pour le reste ce n'est pas exceptionnel : quelques boutique (surtout pour touriste) et café/resto.",3
Local Flavor,"If you visit Montreal you must spend an afternoon in Old Montreal. There is plenty to see and do, there is a lot of history here as well as museums and theater. You can take a horse-drawn carriage ride to see some of the sites if you wish, but I think that walking on a nice day is better. You can go down to the edge of the St. Lawrence River to what we call The Old Port and see a few ships as well. There's a lot of dining options and cute boutiques, but since it is a touristy area you should be careful of paying a lot. In summer you will find street performers and artists, so stop by when the weather is warm!",4
Local Flavor,"What else can I say that hasn't already been said? Old Montreal is a beautiful area that is filled with history, great restaurants, and a great bit of charm. The cobblestone streets are a personal favorite of mine and I loved walking around and seeing all the old, beautiful buildings. There are many things to do around here (such as seeing gorgeous churches like Notre Dame) and it's a great area to take a lot of pictures. The people are also very friendly here and the food is really great. It's true that it's a touristy area, but it's popular because it's wonderful and definitely a place to visit when you're in Montreal.",5
Local Flavor,"Read Mathieu B's review (bilingual) for a great description of why Vieux Montreal is such a special bucket list kind of place.  I cannot improve on his words. 

Some places transcend petty descriptions like, ""touristy, overpriced, self-conscious, all that.""  Not despite, but regardless of anything that might detract from a lesser place, Vieux Montreal is simply magic.  None of that other stuff matters. 

Walk around the narrow cobblestoned streets, imagine yourself in the 18th Century walking the same streets and living amongst the gentry of that day.  Sit and people watch at one of dozens of outdoor cafes. Listen to the romanticism of the French language and the intermix of English, Spanish, German, and the other tongues spoken around you. 

 Know that this is one of the best restored old urban cores in North America.  It will capture your imagination for the day, and become a highlighted memory for life.",5
Local Flavor,"Old Montreal is like the one place in all of Montreal that tourists flock to but this can not take away from the beauty of this area. I just enjoy strolling through this area of souvenir stores and over-priced restaurants, watching buskers and there long drawn out shows and relaxing in the Governors garden. The square in front of Notre Dame Basilica is also a nice place to sit and people watch. t is a beautiful area filled with history that makes for a nice stroll anytime of the year and I can't recommend it enough just for its beauty.",5
Local Flavor,"I love the Old Montreal. It's got this amazing, old feeling that makes you travel back in time. 

The buildings all have wonderful architecture (even though I don't know much about architecture), the restaurants are good and not much pricey compared to some other places (depends on where you go) and everything's so pretty at night here.

Perfect for a romantic stroll.",5
Local Flavor,"Very beautiful, but very expensive!  I only had a few hours in the city so I asked a friend of mine who'd lived there for a few years where I should go if there was only one place to visit. I wish I had more time and discovered the poutineries sooner, and a bigger appetite! We left only taking in the sights, and having an expensive, diluted sangria with ""free"" nachos which were really gross (I never knew you could screw up nachos!). I'd give this place a second chance though and check out some other parts of Old Montreal.",3
Local Flavor,"The cobblestone streets are amazing as is the architecture of the buildings.  Lots of great shops and places to eat.  There was a French Christmas store that was to die for....the colors, sights and sounds.  What a great place!",5
Local Flavor,"Ah ce bon Vieux-Montréal! L'épicentre de l'histoire de notre belle ville avec tes attractions touristiques les plus traditionnelles et typiques, tes milliers de touristes et tes nombreux restaurants qui surchargent... Mais c'est drôle, je t'aime quand même. 

Je t'aime parce qu'avec chaque pas, je me retrouve dans un coin important de notre histoire. Les dalles y sont depuis tes débuts, les murs des édifices nous racontent la fois qu'ils ont vu le feu, et le cœur du quartier nous rappèle sans cesse de notre origine bien pieuse. Ah! Vieille ville! Je t'ai dans le sang (ok. peut-être pas le pieux...)

En hiver, comme en été, tu trouves de quoi nous amuser. Et avec tes soirées bien tranquilles, une fois 17h arrivé, et tes terrasses sur les toits les plus huppés, tu nous réserves des soirées romantiques inégalées! 

Je ne te demande qu'une chose : n'oublie pas que notre ville n'est pas composée d'un seul quartier, mais bien d'une douzaine d'univers uniques et inusités!",5
Local Flavor,"Great city, restaurants, points of interest and shopping.

However, they sort of run a nanny state here. The poor citizens who live right downtown are subjected to parking patrol harassment.  A meter maid/guy for every two blocks. Constant ticket writing, etc. The poor citizens who live downtown and rely on street permit parking have to move their cars, I  believe 3-5 days per week, by 1pm, from one side of the street to the other for cleaning purposes?  The meter police patrol these areas and are Johnny on the spot writing tickets right away. What a bunch of parasites, and the City manager as well. They raise 30 million a year on this, have hundreds of ticket writers, and all seeming on incentive programs. Poor citizens, who also acknowledge  this as a problem.

Also, last week I noticed two cops standing on a corner of Saint Catherine Street, a major shopping street. They were waiting for citizens to cross the street on red lights?  What city does this? Certainly none in the good old USA. Then they confront the person, extract their Visa card and process fines on the spot. Again, parasites! I hear in Paris its even worse? I can't even imagine.

I know now they are on incentives. My temporary roommate showed me her records after living there for 12 year. Over 100 parking tickets, many bogus but she has to take time to go to court tom address them. Can you imagine a world where cops have incentives for more pay based on constant ticket writing?",3
Local Flavor,"Vieux Montreal was the last place on our list of things to see this past weekend, mainly cause I had a feeling it would be a super touristy, pseudo-historical area... and I was pretty much spot-on with my apprehensions. At first glance, the cobble-stoned streets and old architecture may delight you and give you the impression of visiting a historically accurate site, but upon closer inspection, you realize that this part of town has been overrun by tourist traps, gaudy souvenir shops, corny horse-drawn carriages (again, tourist trap), and strange people in medieval costumes. Everything is over-priced. There are no family-owned boutiques or hole-in-the-wall restaurants to sample authentic, local Montreal cuisine, like I'd hoped there'd be. It's just one big money-making farce of a historical site. There are museums nearby, sure, but why look at history behind glass display cases when history should be all around you in food and merchandise and music. Instead, all you see are chain stores like Dairy Queens and McDonald's and Ben and Jerry's. Even the maple syrup shop was a tourist-trapping, money-sucking horror. I wanted the charm of a true historical city, with local cuisine, family-owned shops, etc. What I got was Times Square wrapped in a nice cobble-stoned, medievel-esque giftbox.

If you want real history, check out Montreal's best family-owned restaurants, local cuisine chefs, etc. Vieux Montreal is not worth more than a 30 min walkthrough unless you want to waste more time wandering around an inane tourist bubble.",2
Local Flavor,"My first time back to Montreal in 10 years and had to re-visit Old Montreal.  It's one of those rare historic areas in Canada where you can pretend you are in the 1800's.  From the cobblestone road to the Old Port to Notre Dame, there are plenty of historic buildings and structures to tour.  

I loved walking on the Old Port as you get a great view of the St. Lawrence  river and see some other attractions such as the Science Centre.  In addition, there are plenty of benches.  

Verdict: One of the must-visit sites in Montreal. Don't miss out.",5
Local Flavor,"Location: I guess I'll state the obvious just in case... it's in the old port. Start walking down University or St. Urbain and just on keep going until you reach Notre-Dame or St. Paul. The closest subways are Champ-de-Mars and Square Victoria, both on the orange line. If you get the bright idea of driving, you're going to spend most of your day trying to find a parking spot. If you're lucky enough to find one, you will then have to remember to feed the meter OR pay ridiculous prices for day parking in a lot. Personally, I refuse to park my car in those lots - they're tiny and your car is sandwiched in, making it easy to scratch or dent.

The place: Yes, it's touristy as some reviewers have stated. But what big city doesn't have touristy areas? You can't sh*t on Old Montreal for being touristy when it's such a beautiful part of town and offers so much history. The architecture and lovely cobblestone streets alone make it worth a visit. If you want to avoid tourist traps like restaurants and souvenir shops, then just don't go into those places. No? Anyway, I personally love to go into the old town to shoot pics or people watch. It's got a very European feel to it and like I said, the architecture is fantastic. If you're a first-time visitor to Montreal, you SHOULD add this to your list of places to visit, even if it's only for an hour to do a quick walk-through.  Unlike what one of the reviewers said, there ARE local shops and restaurants - you just need to do your research and find them. That said, as with any touristy area, you will find many over-priced restaurants and stores - some may be worth visiting while most won't. 

What to know: 
If you're staying in the downtown core, it's very easy to walk down into the port. Depending on where you're staying, it might take between 20-30 minutes. For example, if you start walking from the McGill campus, you'll be there in 20 minutes. No need for a car or transit!

In the summer, the place is overrun with tourists so bring your patience!",4
Local Flavor,"If you are visiting Montreal you should make some time to walk this part of the Island. Beautiful little stores, cafes & the port are a few of the things to take in. Great to walk thru with your camera. The restaurants here are usually quite busy so book ahead and parking is limited so be sure to walk or take public transport! Be sure to spend a night or afternoon exploring this part of town. Old cobblestone on the streets so ladies leave your heals at home!",5
Local Flavor,Take a page out of a French 1800's guidebook and you've got living history. So beautifully maintained and such happy and pleasant locals. had a blast walking around especially to Jacques Cartier square where its simply happy. Floral pots and street artists. Ice Cream GALORE! Perfect way to spend the day,4
Local Flavor,"how many tourists does it take to change a lightbulb? i don't know but you can always find out, you won't be running short of tourists!

beautiful beautiful part of town that is simply magical when its a snowy night during the holidays!

the truly bad is mainly price related. since its a tourist trap, its so expensive! you're basically paying to be seen at a trendy popular spot most of the time. some restaurants are truly great but its quite unaffordable.

it does get dead (day or night) when its cold out or rainy though.

as for shops, they are either quite expensive or they are just souvenir boutique. not much quirky interesting shops in old montreal.

on the other hand, the many museums are simply great.

anyway, great for sightseeing and discovering new things and maybe hear a couple of ghost stories and maybe indulge in one of those restaurants.

ps. if the air around you smell like shit, you know you're in old montreal unless its october/november then, it may be farmers spreading manure in the townships",4
Local Flavor,"An iconic MTL landmark to celebrate my review # 600! 

The old port is one of the best magical tourist destinations in Montreal, south of downtown right along the water.  In spring + summer and early fall it's bustling on the weekends with people walking up and down the streets and in the alleyways. It's a great adventure for a sunny day (not too shabby for a rainy day also)!  In the winter the crowds are less but the charm is different very tranquil winter wonderland feel none the less. The best I can describe it is in the winter if you shake an old ""village scenery"" snow globe, this is what old Montreal feels like! Simply amazing like a Santa's village! 

The old port offers some excellent boutique hotels. Some of the top are :
The St James, Nelligan, Auberge du Vieux port, St Sulpice

If you want to stay somewhere a bit further but more chain style the Westin, Intercontinental and W Montreal are just a bit of a farther walk away but closer N to St Catherine's. 

There are restaurants, evening lounges (a plenty) in Vieux Montreal and the food scene there is quite vibrant. Some of my faves to name a few in the old port are:
Gibbys, Jardin Nelson, The Keg, Modavie

Lots of tourist shops, high end art Galleries on the West side but lots to explore. 

Parking is a royal PITA and very expensive. I'd recommend ""biting the bullet"" and paying by the water the hefty rate (you can encircle the area for 30 min with no luck) or parking further away and walking down from the Subway (champ de mars or Square Victoria). 

All in all it's a must see when in Montreal no matter how much time you have! It's fun to wander the cobblestone streets and get a feel for the charm and feel of the neighbourhood!",5
Local Flavor,Great tourist area with lists of shopping and dining. If your exploring Montreal I'm sure you'll want to stop in here!,5
Local Flavor,"Yet another throw back to a more simple time. The architecture is superb and is a testament to the old world pride of craftsmanship. I could wander around here all day and let my mind dream of what it must have been like back in the day when horse drawn buggies were the norm. 

  All I can say is I highly recommend everyone take a trip to MTL and take the time to appreciate the old world charm before that too gets replaces with some awful modern monstrosity. I hope that never happens, but weirder shit has. 

   Yes it is a tourist trap, but its a tourist trap like none other. Just go and then you'll understand what I'm talking about. At the edge of Old MTL is a beautiful park like setting to view the Saint Lawrence river. Take a picnic and have a nice lunch down ther and avoid the over priced, mediocre cuisine offered at many of the sidewalk cafes.",5
Local Flavor,"Very beautiful feel of Montreal that resembles a European setup with the cobbled steps and architecture. Simply wandering the streets alone is a pleasure with its romantic appeal. Even the McDonald's looks gorgeous.
It's also conveniently close to Old Port and China Town in case you'd like to check out other tourist attractions.
There are many nice places to dine at or grab a drink although some of these options are pricy.
Take a stroll through this dreamy part of Montreal. I'm sure you won't regret it.",4
Local Flavor,As a horse person and grew up with them I find the carriage horses very under weight!,1
Local Flavor,"Like being in Europe without leaving North America!

Compared to the predictably ordinary downtown district and regrettably shabby look of the outlying suburban areas, Old Montreal is a delightful change of atmosphere, with beautiful old-world architecture straight out of Paris, Rome, or Budapest. Don't miss the narrow cobblestone streets, wrought iron streetlights, horse-drawn carriages clacking by, regal public squares flanked by flags and statues, and more. It is really a sight to be seen, and offers some great neighborhoods to take a scenic walk throughout.

I highly recommend a visit to Old Montreal when visiting the city.",5
Local Flavor,"Cobblestones, narrow roads, charming old word euro-facades... no visit to Montreal is complete without strolling through the city's historical quarter. On a Monday night, all the restaurants seemed packed on the thoroughfare, including the Ben & Jerry's and Montreal Poutine. As efficiently smart ""touristes"", we had dinner elsewhere and did a simple walkthrough. 

Let's be real, the architecture's the reason why people flock to the area. Once you get past the supposed ""traps"", whip out that camera, snap away, marvel and just enjoy.",4
Local Flavor,Old Montreal is just spectacular! For day one and night time it was lively and vibrant!! Definitely a must when in Montreal!,5
Local Flavor,"I have been to Old Montreal numerous of time in various season.

I would not comment on all those cheesy souvenir stores as I never set foot in any of them. I would not comment on those overpriced restaurants as I never ate in any of them.

I just love wandering around the cobble streets and admire the beautiful historical buildings.

A great area to have a stroll and take some photos.",4
Local Flavor,A must see if you come to Montreal. I love the historical building and you'll see a ton. We plan to take the walking tour tomorrow after which I'll post a review. We sat in the square in front of Norte Dame and people watched.,4
Local Flavor,"So beautiful at night!

The architecture is just amazing. I would come back just to be able to see these buildings during the day. 

I sat in front of Notre Dame with my dinner and just stared at the buildings and people watched. 

Nothing can beat cobblestone streets and tall historical buildings!",5
Local Flavor,"Touristy. However, with a lot of history attached. Some interesting areas, but somewhat disappointing to see all the tchotchke shops and stores hawking tasteless tee shirts.

A lot of high end restaurants and bars, which were nicely designed. At any rate, any trip to Montreal is worth a visit here.",4
Local Flavor,The architecture is amazing! Walking the streets is like walking in Europe. Visiting Old Montreal makes for an amazing experience when visiting Montreal.,5
Local Flavor,"There's cafes and shops all around. The cobblestone streets and interesting architecture is awesome. If you want a mid afternoon snack, make sure you wander around Old Montreal for a little bit.",4
Local Flavor,"I loved wandering around Old Montreal.  Montreal by itself is a great city for pedestrians and public transportation users.  Old Montreal kicks it up a notch with its historic architecture, cobblestone streets, restaurants and their outdoor dining, small boutique shops, souvenir shops, open plazas and statues, etc.  Definitely walk down Saint Paul street.  You can't miss it, it's the oldest street in Montreal.

I highly recommend checking out Le Robin Square (small family restaurant) and Notre Dame Basilica (closes ~4pm) while in Old Montreal.",5
Local Flavor,"I had been to Old Montreal couple times and still love this place.  The favourite travelling seasons will be between early Summer and early Fall.  The weather is usually nice and warmer for walking and exploring the very European-style cafes, boutique shops, historical scenery and buildings around this old town.  

The Horse & Carriage tour is a must try.  The driver takes you to all major historical scenes with informative guides and humorous tales.  As far as I remember, the tour charges a minimum of a half-hour tour.  It is expensive for one person for sure.  However, it worths to try when you have a group of two or more.  The Carriage is spacious enough to accommodate four adults and just enough for add two more kids.",4
Local Flavor,While visiting Montreal we made it a point to stop in at Old Montreal. We loved walking through the area and exploring the history associated with this portion of the city.,4
Restaurants,"Coffee is made here, sandwiches are not. Ordering 2 coffees and 1 sandwich, I asked for soy in the coffee, 1 hot peppermint mocha and 1 iced chai and some how received a cold peppermint mocha and hot chai both with soy. I couldn't taste the peppermint in the mocha, not sure if it was served cold is the reason. The sandwich, I requested it to be cut in half and made without cheese, the lady responded back with the sandwiches are pre-made. I'm just wondering how long before was it made? At least the second lady who was making the coffee let me take 2 apples from the basket. If you are short on time and can't run out to a different location, this is the spot for you. If you are able to get out and have time to stop somewhere else, I would do that instead. Service may be kind of slow too.",3
Restaurants,"***E Go Cafe is located in the Renaissance hotel and their Greek yogurt parfait is pretty good--topped with sweet and crunchy granola, good candied pistachios, and fresh fruit; unfortunately, the lines can really build here (due to its small size and kitchen) and the prices are high (but that is kind of the case with food in Las Vegas)***

Like most hotels in Las Vegas, the Renaissance hotel offers both valet and self parking.",3
Restaurants,"Coffee is fresh and ready but the sandwiches are pre-made and meh. Everything is grab-n-go which is fine, but because it's in the hotel, it's over-priced and makes you feel kinda like they could have at least asked your name first before they...well you know. Convenient though and the Illy coffee is pretty darn good!",3
Public Services & Government,"If you call their phone number, and press ""0"" to speak to a person on any of the prompts; it will forward you to a voicemail box of someone named ""CC"". After the voicemail plays her personal greeting the phone just hangs up everytime.

Public Services & Government,"I'd give this place zero stars if I could. Let me set the scene: I sleep during the day and a loud knock interrupts my slumber. By the time I get to the door, the person is gone, but a letter is shoved into the crack of my door. The name on the envelope makes no sense to me, so I open it. It's a court summons for a guy I've never heard of, at an address that isn't mine. Really? The guy who delivered this must be REALLY bright, because I'm on the odd numbered side of the street, and this guy being summoned address is on the even side of the street. Derp. So, I call the number on the letter, like the good, law abiding citizen I am, to let them know they made a mistake and should probably resend the summons so this guy knows he has to show up in court. The lady I got on the phone was a complete, how should I put this eloquently... Oh yeah, a total b**ch. She made ME feel like a criminal, although I was only trying to be helpful. She told me if I didn't do anything with the letter, it's be like I was holding someone else's mail. What? Your guy delivered it to the wrong address and I'M in the wrong? So effed up! Although I don't think I should have to take any action at all, because this is literally NOT my problem, I'll send it back to the court house, only because I feel for the guy who would miss the court date if I didn't. If someone from the court is reading this right now, feel free to contact me, because I am furious at the way I was treated over the phone for trying to be a kind and responsible citizen.",1
Public Services & Government,"Simply Truth
in the last week-Edit
This court house works with lawyers who represent cases from this jurisdiction. They are used to seeing the same lawyers and they all work in conjunction with the lawyer. They are NOT for the person trying to seek real justice against any business or person. They side with the lawyers and they railroad cases.

 The presiding judge was a lawyer and sides with lawyers no matter how you may want to express injustice. This court will laugh in your face as the deputy clerk did to me the other day. The clerks will yell at you to sit and wait an hour for a late lawyer to show up. 

They will move your case from a small claims case to a civil case just so the lawyer can represent the client and if you don't get a lawyer you will not be able to defend yourself. They have rigged the system here as a kangaroo court.

 Cases just get dismissed and all they want is the fees for filing the cases from everyone. You will not get justice here.

 They will say they mailed a letter to you when they didn't and the lawyer will say the same. The cases which are heard are before a lawyer not a judge. There is no justice here. Don't waste your time, energy or money if you don't get a lawyer here to represent you. It is already fixed with the decisions as they have tried the same cases for different people and they just trick you through each phase as they are just playing a game watching you get upset.

 They are unprofessional and the defendants lawyer I was fighting knows just how to swindle and lie just like the defendants she represents. All they do is push one paper upon another through to the court and no one ever gets a trial even if you ask for one because the judge has already decided to dismiss the case halfway through. They know at what stage to do this too. It's a timed game.

 If you have a case in this jurisdiction for this courthouse  try to move it to another district court because this one is tainted and seems like no one cares.

 If you already had a case dismissed even from the past file a complaint online against the judge and courthouse and see if you can get a different court to hear your case.Someone in the judicial system has to do something about the court and how they are rigged with these lawyers and the judge.",1
Restaurants,"I just moved into the Matthews-Indian Trail area and I was soooo happy to know that their was a local place that serves Pho and Banh Xeo (Vietnames Pancakes)! I met the owner and he was so friendly, told me it was family owned and operated so I know that the food is going to be AWESOME and it sure was!!! This will be my place for Pho that's for sure! If you've never  tried the cuisine, you should, it's very very addicting! And healthy! :)",5
Restaurants,"Last night was my second dine here and my second Bahn Mi here (2nd Bahn Mi anywhere).  If you are a sandwich fan and a fan of Vietnamese BBQ Pork and fixings: Cucumber, Daikon, shredded Carrot and Cilantro -  No Mayo PLEASE (I remember to tell them to skip the Mayo)!

Also I had a side of Grilled Cured Sliced Pork and an order of Fresh Rolls with Shrimp and Pork with Fish sauce!  Service and Food Fantastic!

Note: Most of there food is Chinese and understandably as they are still a new business and more locals will recognize favorites and hopefully the Vietnamese selections can increase over time - The Owners are here and are very friendly and outgoing!",5
Restaurants,This restaurant deserves a full five stars because of the service they provide and the fresh food that they make. As a business owner I can tell what place has the most authentic Vietnamese food and Saigon Kitchen makes it authentic ladies and gentlemen!!,5
Restaurants,"Sometimes I just don't feel like driving up to Le's to get a Banh Mi - maybe it is because I really don't want to get the car aligned for a sandwich, no matter how good that sandwich might be. Plus, some places are just closer. So we'll pop on over to Saigon Kitchen.

Even better is you can get a nice bowl of pho to go along with your sandwich, or if you are feeling like something else entirely, you can go off in that direction instead. Plenty of options on the menu, and the staff has always been very welcoming and will help you choose a dish that fits your mood.

Not much to look at from the outside, but well worth a stop!",4
Restaurants,"Really, it's the Banh Mi sandwiches that do it for me.  Tasty cured or roasted pork with fresh ingredients on a perfectly crisp crusted, soft and chewy roll.  Simple but so delicious.  Get there early because they have limited quantities of the bread.  Get two!",4
Restaurants,"Okay, I drove out to this place because of the yelp reviews.  I order several items just so I could get a taste for a few things.  The Banh Mi as everyone before me has reviewed was really good. Very fresh tasting and the pork had a wonderful flavor.  I will be back for that.  However, I ordered the lemongrass beef with rice noodle and was sad to see that beef lacked any real flavor and the noodles were so overcooked that they were mushy. (yuck!)  I saw they had a shrimp fried rice (isnt that chinese?) so I ordered that for my boyfriend at home.  It came with a light pink shrimp sauce that was pretty good. (like the one you get at hibachi spots) lots of big shrimp but it really needed that sauce. The spring roll was pretty good also.  I will go back but not for their noodle bowls, havent tried the pho yet but update when I do.",3
Restaurants,"So let me tell you about my journey with this place, I live about 20-30mins away and I made a special trip up to this place on a Sunday, to find out that they were closed. Pic I submitted. I was not a happy camper about that. Anyway, my husband was coming home one day the next week and I asked him to stop by a pick me up a banh mi. I could not wait to get my sandwich, so I was very disappointed once it did. The flavor and texture just was not right. I could not take more then 3 bits switch was to bad because the herb salad on top was very fresh. 

I might have to go there and eat in house",3
Restaurants,"Great pho. The noodles can become too soft quickly- so slurp that pho up fast! The egg rolls rock, and the owners are as nice as can be. Please check this place out for the pho and banh mi. This place deserves a look if you haven't been.",4
Restaurants,"This place is great! Authentic banh mi, pho, and all other Vietnamese specialties!
They have a few generic Chinese dishes but if you want a winner stick with the Vietnamese! 

Bbq pork in or on anything its amazing, on the banh mi, or in rice best i have ever had. Great bread on the sandwich, crusty outside, super soft & fresh inside. 

Every ingredient used looked and tasted amazing and could not be more fresh! 
Already planning what i want on my next visit! Can't wait!",5
Restaurants,"I'm so happy I have a place for pho close to me! The viet summer rolls were delicious too with fresh  herbs and clean shrimp! My pho had a nice broth, thin rare meat, and a plate of fresh toppings to put in. I thoroughly enjoyed it! The owner or only woman that was there was extremely friendly and loved my toddler which is a plus with me! 
I only wish it was bigger like more of a restaurant rather a sit in fast food place.
But please check it out, it needs to stay in business, 
Also hubby had beef and broccoli which was very good as well, not your typical greasy Chinese.",5
Restaurants,"GOOD FOOD. GOOD PRICE. NICE LADY.

Pho is great. Let me tell you, I am a PHOnatic and Saigon Kitchen has some great pho. The broth is very good and cleanses my soul haha. 
Chicken Fried Rice is also good. Spring rolls were on point, Haven't tried anything else yet, but I will soon. Nice lady, too friendly.",5
Restaurants,Very good Bahn Mi sandwich,4
Restaurants,"Fantastic, as usual!!! The new Avocado Spring Rolls were delicious. Can't wait to have them again!! The owners are awesome, as well!!",5
Restaurants,"I love this place already and it's only my first time here!! Food is authentic and delicious and a good portion. The bubble tea is wonderful on a hot day. The owner is a sweetheart, like a mom away from home. I definitely want to come back for bubble tea every week!!",5
Restaurants,"Let's start with the positives, banh mi and banh xeo were great. The other three dishes we got to sample, not too flavorful. Perhaps because we went at 2:30 pm and it's an off time (still no excuse) but the entrée dishes were bland with only 4-5 pieces of meat. Can I get some meat in flavorless sauce with my rice? Shesh.  

Perhaps they should just specialize on banh mi sandwiches. We'll make the drive into town and continue going to Central for better Vietnamese food.",2
Restaurants,Seigon Kitchen is an excellent place to eat. All the food is wonderful especially the sizzling cake.They make the best fish sauce I have ever tasted. I am always telling the very nice lady that she should bottle it. Great food and the nicest people you could ever meet. Go! Enjoy!,5
Restaurants,"Finally went by and tried this place...banh mi was yummy, excellent pho, absolutely loved the bbq pork fried rice (ours was very flavorful, not bland as a previous review stated). Eggrolls were crunchy and small and delicious, spring rolls were also very good. Finally, our chicken lo mein was much tastier than anticipated, we ate more than the kids! All together we were able to feed the family for $32, not bad at all! Most definately going back!",5
Restaurants,"I was trying to find places for Chinese food in Indian trail, I came across this place because of the good reviews. Unfortunately they didn't make the meal that I requested and made something they said I will like. The meal was okay, I wouldn't get it again, and I had to wait an extra 10 minutes for the meal. I was under the impression they didn't even have it made until I arrived, 30 minutes after I ordered.",3
Restaurants,Try the rice noodles with cured pork...delicious and light...my husband thinks they are a little slow on service (even for take out) but the food is totally worth it!,5
Restaurants,"What a great take out place,  we have tried the Pho Beef soup which is my wife's favorite and Sizzle Cake which in my favorite.   I was a little worry about the Sizzle Cake, but it is wonderful.   Dip it in the fish sauce and you will think you are in heaven.",5
Restaurants,"Outstanding food & service.  Had the Vietnamese Spring Rolls (Delicious), Avocado Egg Rolls, & Papaya Salad (Absolute Best).  Highly recommend all 3 dishes.",5
Restaurants,"First time here for lunch so I was very excited. Ordered goi cuon, grilled chicken sandwich, banh xeo/sizzling cake, and beef pho to share with my lunch date. True to Vietnamese dishes, vegetables were very fresh - bean sprouts, basil, jalapeños, and lettuce. Sandwich and banh xeo were delicious. Pho was average with a lack of spices in the broth. The rice paper for goi cuon was not soaked well and was hard in certain areas. 

The service was also average. We were the only people there and it took longer than expected to get the food. Five minutes the first dish of goi cuon and 20 to 25 minutes for the pho and banh xeo. I imagine if there were a few more tables, the wait would be much longer.",4
Restaurants,This place is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've ever eaten in I love the food there I love the owner she is the sweetest woman and a great cook so if you're looking for  great Vietnamese food stop by here you will not be disappointed,5
Restaurants,"Saigon kitchen is one of the few restaurants that I would never return to, if I could rate it a no star I would. The owner was the rudest person ever!!! Their restaurant was completely dead, and they have a B for their sanitation grade. Don't waste your money or time.",1
Restaurants,Take out pho not assembled...raw meat in container with noodles. Gross! Egg drop soup was neon orange. Everything else was just like any other greasy Chinese takeout.,1
Restaurants,"The banh mi and pho are really good, as some people say the raw meat is separate when you get takeout. Just heat your broth and assemble it as soon as you get home.

The different egg rolls are some of the best i have had, they are super fresh and always good.",4
Restaurants,"After pulling in front of the shop. I'll admit, we were hesitant to turn around and go to our usual pho joint BUT we gave it a try. Looks can be deceiving so don't be quick to judge this tiny gem. 

This restaurant appears to be a mom and pop shop. With that being said, don't expect anything too grand when it comes to the pho. It's simple yet, I admire it. I like simplicity. It reminds me of something my mom or myself would throw together when making a quick pho. There are only two options, chicken pho or beef with meatball pho. Go with the beef and meatball. To me, it's a lot better than other places I've tried. 
Spring rolls were the usual. It's the usual good. Their strawberry boba taste more of a strawberry smoothie but I'm not complaining. It taste as if fresh strawberries were used instead of the typical flavored powders. They only offer strawberry, green tea, or taro. There may be one other flavor but I cannot recall at the moment. 

This place would be perfect for a quick bite of pho. Or for anyone passing through and are hungry. Also, CPCC students or teachers may find this place as a good choice to grab lunch or dinner as its nearby the Levine campus. 

I would personally revisit. The staff were kind and sweet.",4
Restaurants,"This was not a great experience.   We waited at least 3-5 minutes before anyone came out of the kitchen to the counter to take our order.  We placed our order and took a seat.   We waited more than 10 minutes for our drinks.  The summer rolls (spring rolls Vietnamese style) were subpar.   They tasted fishy, we're not rolled tight and the peanut sauce was bland and did not have peanuts in it.  The beef pho was ok.  It was warm but pretty bland.   However it was the perfect size.  Not too much, not too little.  Overall not a good experience.  Food wasn't that great and the service was les than desired.  I doubt we will be going back.",1
Restaurants,This review is strictly for the banh mi sandwiches.  I was really hoping that they would be delicious as this is the only place in the area that serves them but I would say they were just average at best.  I tried the pork and grilled chicken banh mi's (i preferred the chicken).  The veggies did not even taste pickled which I feel is the signature part of the sandwich.  They were also missing fresh jalapenos!,3
Restaurants,"I came here because of a previous review I was looking to saves some money.  At first glance the restaurant didn't look like much, as its in a strip mall like many Chinese restaurants have with a few tables in.  They do have a lunch menu that starts at $5.99. The menu looked like Chinese so I thought maybe this wasn't Vietnamese at all.  So I ordered Chicken with mixed vegetables.  The cokes (store bought 16 oz) variety are 2 bucks.

The food was really good. It did have a Vietnamese style and flavor to it so I was pleased.  I finished the plate right off. You get enough for one person so no left overs.  

I would probably come here again, but might get a cup of water next time to save the extra $2.  My total bill was $8.16 which wasn't too bad. Recommend.",4
Public Services & Government,"Unprofessional every step of the way. Have filed multiple LLCs, all were delayed and met with rude and lacking service (was even hung up on once). In Minnesota you walk in, file and they hand you your approved documents. Not sure why it takes months to file a legit business in AZ.",1
Public Services & Government,"In recent correspondence with the Corporation Commission, i have had the pleasure of speaking with Allison regarding questions or concerns happening with my filings. She has been a joy to have there because my previous experience were like many state employees that kind of treat you like trash and want you off the phone. Allison goes above and beyond what  I need and I have been filing with the Corp Commission for about 5 years now. Thank you so much for your poise and expertise. I appreciate it so much!",5
Local Flavor,"Soccer fields, softball fields, and a playground in a big safe area! Love it!",4
Local Flavor,"I am NOT a fan of this park.  At this point in the fall, the grass is completely dead.  It gets everywhere when you walk on it.  I am sure that the kids practicing here who fall on it are not enjoying it at all!  I am not sure why, but they are putting fences up around and through the park.  Why would you purposefully divide a park?  It makes no sense.  The only thing, and I mean ONLY thing, that I like about this park is that in putting the fencing in and making changes, they have flattened out some of the dirt lots, which make it easier for driving.  If someone asked me if they should have their sports practice times there, I would tell them that there has to be a better place out there!",2
Local Flavor,"As of today Clark County bureaucrats have raped this park, and stolen it from the people. 

Just a few days ago, New Silver Bowl Park was a 150-acre open grassy field in which you and I were free to run, play frisbee, play tag football, walk your dog, play the drums, have a picnic. But the idea of a unfenced park is intolerable to bureaucrats. Today, at a cost of $1.2 million, they are installing menacing 9 foot high metal spike fencing around the entire park -- not merely chain-link fencing but the kind of fencing you would expect to find at a prison, military base, or the Berlin Wall.  

At best, if you are physically challenged and can't walk long distances you'll have to hike hundreds of yards to find an opening in the fence. At worst, you'll have to use the park at a time and place when your civil masters deign to unchain one of the few openings in the fence.

None of the photos on this page reflect current reality at this park. When the fence is complete maybe I will post new ones.",1
Local Flavor,Great little place to go running. The park for the kids isn't great. There's a trail and lots if space.,4
Local Flavor,"I've been going to this rather large park regularly several times a week since I moved into the nearby area 13yrs..ago.It was Great till last year when they put up an expensive ,very tall, menacing, iron spiked fence ! You think they could have done something more constructive with the tax payers money ! While it was being put up I attempted to contact the City Council with no response of course as to why this was being done. I also contacted CH.13 who did an interview with me at the park regarding the installation of this fence that looked very much to keep people out ! It obviously was too little too late to have any real effect ! Now they've split the park in thirds with the fence and have at least one third or more of the park locked at ALL times ! They also took out the baseball/softball diamonds so no more of that ! It appears they Only cater to the soccer tournament crowd now ! So much for a public park to be used and enjoyed by everyone ! The only part that's accessible to everyone anymore is the kiddy area !",1
Local Flavor,"It's ok if you need a playground for the kids to run around.  Almost every time we've gone, there's either homeless people wandering around or sleeping somewhere.",1
Restaurants,"Ok, second time here and we got here a bit late.. If you want the dinner hour, don't come late, almost everything is gone.
Over all great selection of food here, salad bar, pasta bar, pizza, donuts and a list of other delish carbs I can't eat.. boo for me..
Coffee, soda, milk, who drinks milk? Might be for the cereal bar.. hummmm
The cat that serves the grilled cheese, chicken breasts and hamburger pattys is always smiling and happy..
This place is pretty big, and it is clean, large selection of food and a pretty decent price. Im pretty sure the dining hall is open until 7 on most nights, but get there early for the best selection..",4
Restaurants,"If you don't spend extra money for food, get swiped into the DC forsure! If you're looking for amazing food, this is the wrong place to go. Whenever I'm not really caring about what I eat, I'll be here and hope they are serving decent food. Whenever they don't have anything I like, I usually just either make myself a salad from the salad bar or I just eat cereal. There are also a few very rude staff members.. -_-",2
Restaurants,"Tonight I ate a crunchy piece of burnt pizza out of a styrofoam takeout box , there were no cups to drink , the food was extremely mediocre . The chef wouldn't give me the pineapple. The customer service was great however ! dining commons , you are somewhat despicable.",2
Restaurants,"The dining commons excels in offering an impressive array of desserts, beverages, and salad bar options but could use a boost to its main entree selections. Here's my beef with the DC: there's a sandwich station that boasted a menu with a pesto caprese option. Being that I love caprese (and it was the only vegetarian option), it was the logical choice to go caprese. Come to find out, the ""pesto"" is actually pesto mayo and there is no basil on the sandwich! You simply cannot omit basil from caprese. It's one of the main goddamn ingredients! I made do with lettuce instead, and my sad faux caprese ended being okay for a light lunch snack. 

Besides the salad bar and the sandwich station, there's a pizza and pasta bar and what looked like a Chinese food section. I grabbed some fries that were set up to a hot dog station to finish up my main course. 

Dessert is where it's at! There was brownies, cupcakes, cookies, and a Dryer's ice cream machine complete with chocolate sprinkles waiting to be scooped up. The brownies and ice cream were yummy. Beverages available include a Nestle hot chocolate machine, coffee, soda, juice, and lemon water to name a few. I was super impressed that they had chocolate and vanilla soymilk on standby!

When you're all done eating, there's a conveyor belt where students drop off all their dishes. I'd compare the quality of the food at the dining commons to EDR food or any other cafeteria type place. Most things are just okay, but there are a few standouts. My lunch date got a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and stuffing, and she absolutely loved her food.

Restaurants,"Ce bar n'a aucune prétention, le prix des bières est normal (5$ la pinte pendant l'happy hour il me semble et un peu plus le reste du temps). La terrasse est très agréable, les serveurs très sympathiques et attentionnés. Il y a plusieurs écrans avec des matchs retransmis. Coté bouffe, la carte est assez bien garnie et les serveurs sauront vous conseiller.

Mon conseil: Prenez une poutine, avec un supplément bacon (un délice).",4
Restaurants,"This is a very unassuming resto-bar. I've come here several times, at different times, and I've been impressed most times. The servers are very friendly, and will strike up a conversation with you. The food is consistent (not too extravagant, but quite good). Their pastas are rather decent, the pizza isn't too shabby either. They do however have a very good smoked salmon bagel (piled really high with salmon). Great happy hour specials, very good drinks, and quite inexpensive! Worth checking out.",3
Restaurants,"I truly have mixed feelings about this place. I ate here three times while staying at a hotel down the road. The first night I had pizza which was absolutely horrible, and one of the worst pizzas I have ever had. But the other member of my party enjoyed her fish and chips, so we went the next night. The second night, the club sandwich special was absolutely amazing. The third night I had an order of nachos, which were quite bad. The meals here were hit and miss, with the hits being grand, but the misses being dreadful.

There are two other problems I had with this restaurant. First, the service was extremely slow. Waited nearly 30 minutes from meal being finish to paying the check. The water was never refilled either. While the servers were nice, they were very slow. Looking at how they were running the place, I think that the front-of-the-house was understaffed, but also that the servers were not trained properly, as they would bus tables during a dead time while not dropping checks to customers who were impatiently waiting to leave, like myself. Second, the place was quite dirty. When the sun comes through in the afternoon, you can see that the floors had not been mopped.

While this place can serve up a good dish, one must proceed with caution.",2
Restaurants,WORST service I have ever experienced. I don't normally write reviews but the service was so bad I needed to let people know. Waiter never came to check on us and we had to leave after an hour of not getting our food.,1
Restaurants,"Not really the best place

But let's say that at Galeries du Parc the ""competition"" is fierce. For the biggest disappointment, that is.

The appetizer soup is as bland as it gets, one of the few times I didn't bother finishing it. Then the main dish was probably as exiting as something from a chain restaurant, if not less.

I won't bother again, maybe for a drink, but only if I'm out of options.",2
Restaurants,"Fine establishment. It is usually not very busy, and as a result they are low staffed. At the same time, the price is reasonable and they have some good food deals. I used to live in the area and it was a favourite of ours. Definitely a good place to stop for a drink, especially in the summer when they have the patio open.",3
Restaurants,"J'habite au-dessus de cet ancien Giorgio (ce l'était durant mon adolescence, i.e lors de la préhistoire) et le faible achalandage ne m'a jamais incitée à m'y asseoir. Mon intuition aurait du prévaloir sur mon jugement. Inutile de palabrer jusqu'à l'aube: une visite suffit. On m'a servi de banales ailes de poulet assaisonnées de Frank's Red Hot. Suivies d'un spaghetti... déjà ""mélangé avec la sauce"". Pas mauvais mais me rappelant mon assiette que je n'ai pas achevée la veille et que j'ai gardée pour le lendemain.",2
Restaurants,"I have been going to this place for 4 years since I live right next to it. They always have great food for great price. The deals they do are really great. They also have slot machine you can enjoy. In summer they bring so get on the terrace and the atmosphere is soo cozy and friendly. 
The owner and his wife are super nice. They always make sure the customers are happy. And nothing beats their happy hour from 4 to 7 and always enjoy talking to France best staff they ever had. The atmosphere watching hockey games it insanely exciting and watching the allouettes games there is even nicer since they r just meters away from the stadium. 

I recommend that place for their amazing food nice atmosphere and great friendly staff. You pay barely anything for what you get in return",5
Restaurants,Pretty standard western diners type of food though the fries were really tasty. If you're looking for a fuss free experience Hielo is a good place to head to. Service was good and overall it was a pleasant experience.,3
Local Flavor,"Now I am not one to shy away from reviewing an oddball item now and again, so when Stephen K. steps up and beats me to a review of a bridge I have to think I might be slipping.

The Matheson Bridge is indeed a gateway of sorts to NoDa.  Like most bridges, you probably pay it little attention - it is a bridge, after all.  To get into NoDa, you simply drive under it, and since it is a fairly standard road overhead, you spend all of a half a second underneath.  Most people probably do not get out in this area of town, so you likely will not stop to look at the art on the columns, but if you do, it might be worth your time - the mural developing will likely never be shown in a museum (who would move an entire bridge?), but it is both unique and historic in its subject, as well as sprucing up the place a bit.

Beyond that, you are looking at a bridge, albeit for what is likely bound to be a very short time.  Just remember - other than your monumental bridges like perhaps the Brooklyn or Golden Gate bridges, how many such spans do you know that actually have their own web pages?  And more importantly, those are usually run by the transit authority to tell you about tolls and such.  This one tells you about the art and the soul of the bridge, and important distinction, n'est-ce pas?",4
Local Flavor,"Though the bridge itself is simply a means of foregoing the need of an intersection on the west side of NoDa, the beautiful mural makes it stand out and a more memorable part of Charlotte's art flavor. Brainchild of local artist Will Puckett, this gorgeous mural tells a wonderful story of Mecklenburg history. There's a brilliant explanation of this at the listed website. 

Though you may not find yourself walking down North Davidson Street most days, take the time to walk by and take in this gorgeous story/work of art. It's quite remarkable and more memorable up front rather than from your car window.",5
Restaurants,"OH YES I DID!

I have to give this Aliberto guy some credit. While your favorite brand of engineered beverage, personal hygiene liquid, or processed food snack is proudly helping you through the recession by offering 11.5 oz of product in the same 14 oz container- this guy sticks to the game plan.

You can still get the original 3,500 calorie taco salad for less than six bucks, and the Beef Chimichanga STILL comes with a heart stalling wad of shredded beef, fajita vegetables, and fried tortilla smothered in alarming portions of sour cream, guac, and cheese. They are just too legit to quit.

This Aliberto's is also family owned- Mom, Dad, Uncle, two son's and a daughter all work here. And the place is squeeky clean inside. All of the ingredients in the requisite Burrito fixins' bar are always fresh- sliced cucumbers, limes, carrots, red and green sauce.

...and you can get the ice cold bottles of Coke from Mexico that have real cane sugar. So, it's (ahem) actually healthy.",4
Restaurants,"Darn good Mexican food in huge portions and a reasonable price. Although the staff might not all speak fluent English, they're always polite. It's a family owned and operated business, too!",4
Restaurants,"ya wife likes the place, i found it to be funky tasting chicken beans not good   mama not that friendly she was more friendly to my wife",2
Restaurants,I had the rolled tacos. Heavenly!!! With ample guacamole and sour cream and shredded cheese.  And the price can't be beat.,4
Restaurants,"Chorizo breakfast burrito was fairly good, but a bit dry. Could of just been the potatoes though. That being said I would order it again.
Overall a nice place to drive through on the way to work to grab a fast breakfast on the go.",3
Restaurants,"This place is GREAT, I am Latino, invited other  Latinos, and friends all loved it. Tried a lot not everything but will try.",4
Restaurants,always mess up my nachos. never give me back change. i ask them not to put pico de gallo and then they take off the beans or anything else. sometimes they just put everything in it. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE. & ASK FOR A RECIEPT. like if my total was 8.23 they round it to 8.25.. they've done it to me many times on the drive thru.,1
Restaurants,My boyfriend and I love going here for their breakfast burritos. Always fresh and the guy cooking the food always double checks with us to make sure we want everything that comes in the burrito or whatever we get. Their guacamole and chips are great and they give you a ton! The rolled tacos and carne asana torta are a couple of our favorites. This place is great!!!,5
Restaurants,"This location has been open for 14+ years and there's a good reason why...great food and great service!! We've had rolled tacos, quesadillas, several different burritos and of course, horchata! I've always been impressed with their service and the consistency of their food. I try to eat healthy most of the time but when I feel like eating greasy, this is my #1 spot!",5
Restaurants,The food here is always delicious and excellent.  The service can be slow but the staff is very friendly every time.  I would recommend this place to other for sure.,5
Restaurants,"For what looks like the typical 'bertos chain, this was surprisingly good.  I just got a standard Combo Number 1.  It was a Tostada, Taco, Rice, and Beans.  Everything was good.  A lot of these places have very sub-par beans which is a shame because it is such a foundational component of Mexican cooking.  I thought they were pretty good and they weren't all crusty like you see at a lot of the 'berto chains.  I would definitely go back.",5
Restaurants,"I like this place. It is a classic BERTOS chain. I always get the bean and cheese burrito. The only thing I would change would be please improve your RED sauce! Red sauce is kinda iffy each time and wish the red sauce was tastier. Also the workers are very friendly. They don't speak too much English, (hablan un poco pero no entienden mucho del inglés). Also please wear gloves when preparing the food!!",3
Restaurants,"I was there nearly two weeks ago and ordered a chicken burrito. They asked if I wanted grilled chicken and I said yes. I took it home and ate it. It was a good size, so I was psyched. But the chicken wasn't grilled. It was like chicken that is par-boiled. That didn't bother me too much, but what DID bother me was that I bit into TWO chicken bones! Needless to say, I was not pleased. Not sure if I'll ever go back. Too bad, because it was my first time.",3
Restaurants,Been there a lot in the last year. My husband is addicted to the fish tacos and I have a love affair with the the rolled tacos!,5
Local Flavor,"The Pittsburgh Skyline - that iconic view of downtown (mostly photographed from Mt. Washington) was once a hallmark of Pittsburgh, something at which was naturally beautiful to look now suffers from a scorching case of corporate herpes.

I noticed this because today (Aug 17), Bing.com's homepage was a very old late evening photograph of downtown from Grandview Ave, complete with a full moon hovering slightly above and to the left of the USS Tower.

For those of you who don't know: Corporate Herpes is a condition caused by a city whoring out its skyline to the corporate dicks located within the city. Corporations leave their mark forever to be seen on the skyline in the form of logos or names. They scream out ""Yeah, I hit that!"" While everyone else is thinking, ""I DON'T CARE"".

So thanks to Highmark, UPMC, Reed Smith and other ambulance chasers, BNY Mellon and all others for overcompensating.",2
Local Flavor,"Our skyline has to be one of the most beautiful skylines in the country. It's a mixture of concrete, steel, glass, limestone, aluminum and lights. 

The tallest building is the US Steel tower which is the building that has UPMC's name in screaming white letters. It's 64 stories and 841 feet tall. Originally, US Steel wanted to build the tallest building in the world when their new headquarters was being designed, but due to costs and decline in the steel industry, it was scaled back. It's built with a steel invented by US Steel called Cor-ten, the outer skeleton is actually rust, and as the building ages that rust becomes harder, stronger and darker, and non-corrosive. The university of Pittsburgh Medical Center is the largest tenant and had their logo put on top of the building in 2008.

The second tallest building is the 54 story, 750 foot tall BNY-Mellon center. Originally built to be the home of Dravo, before the building was even completed Dravo moved their headquarters to Tennessee and Mellon Bank bought it and was headquartered there. Mellon merged with the Bank of New York and the headquarters moved to Manhattan. BNY-Mellon center is the local headquarters for that company and 3200 people are employed here for that company.

In 1985 the city went through a huge building boom, such buildings as 5th Avenue Place, Federated Investors, and what is now the Westin Convention Center Hotel were changing the Skyline. But, the crown jewel was the forty story, 660 foot tall PPG Place. It's actually 5 buildings, 1 PPG place is the tallest building, 2 PPG place is fourteen stores and buildings 3 through 5 are all five stories. A mixed use building, it's home to shops, restaurants, and office space. It's the home of PPG Industries, formerly the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company. Founded in 1883, at one time PPG out produced all the glass manufacturers in the United States by a 2-1 margin. Over a million square feet of glass cover those five buildings. The HJ Heinz corporation is a major tenant at PPG Place. The decorative spires that adorn the roofs of all five buildings were inspired by Parliament's spires in England.

When looking at the Skyline from Mt Washington along the river fronts edge you'll see a row of smaller, older buildings called First Side. Many of these buildings were built after the 1845 great fire, which destroyed much of the area today known as downtown. First side is a reminder of how downtown looked in the late 1800's.

There has been a great debate about the corporations in the city putting their names and logos on the buildings. recently, UPMC, Highmark, PNC Bank, First Niagara, Reed-Smith, BNY-Mellon, K&L Gates, and Citizens Bank have added to the ""sky-graffiti"" of the skyline. Some people love it, saying it give Pittsburgh that big town feel, while other say it distracts from the beauty of the architecture. It's an ongoing debate. 

The skyline will be changing by 2014 when the new 40 story PNC bank international headquarters will be built. PNC promises it will be the ""greenest"" building in the world.

The Grant Building was Pittsburgh's first skyscraper, completed in 1930, it's 485 feet tall, with 37 stories. This iconic building is known for the beacon on top. At night, the beacon comes to life blinking the word ""Pittsburgh"" in morse code. 

Other iconic buildings in downtown are the art deco Gulf Tower and Koppers Building. Each building has unique lighting. For many years the Gulf Tower with it's pyramid shaped top would light up at night in either orange or blue, (the corporate colors of Gulf Oil) orange meaning fare weather, blue meant fowl weather. It's 44 stories and 585 feet tall, and was completed in 1932. The Koppers building has 34 stories and is 475 feet tall. It's chateauesque style roof makes this building one of a kind. These two buildings along with the Grant Building were the tallest building in the city until 1969 when the US Steel tower was completed. 

Yes, we have a unique skyline, one that is a mixture of old and new, glass and steel, at one time the two top industries in the city. What a beautiful city we have. The most livable in America!",5
Local Flavor,"It gives me tingles and chills each time I approach Pittsburgh and pop out of the tunnel and start to see the familiar skyline that boasts the stadiums that house the Steelers and Pirates and you see why it is called three rivers.....You see bridges, buildings, iconic things like the incline and the point.  You start to imagine the people and events that are taking place in the heart of the city.  It makes me yearn for chipped ham, pierogis, beer, and small talk with the various polish, Slovak, and Italian grandmas and grandpas......makes me thirsty to swill a rolling rock or iron city with some of the colorful characters that reside in this little treasure of a city and have probably resided there their entire lifetime.  You can walk into so many little neighborhood bars in all the cool little suburbs and it is like time has stopped....

I have traveled through many cities and this always remains one of the most impressive skylines I have seen.  There is nothing quite like a little river town....Sure it may not be the most shiny or newest but it will always be the house that built me.",5
Local Flavor,"Amazing looking city.  Pain in the ass to drive in with all the zig zag streets but from afar its dope!  Lots of gritty, old buildings with a touch of modern here and there.  Now, just gotta do something about all the Stiller fans...",5
Local Flavor,"I recently was told by a visiting assist I interviewed that ""Pittsburgh had a soul you can see"". How amazing is that? From the North Shore,  PNC Park or Mt. Washington,  the view never disappoints. You can walk from one side of the city to another in 20 mimes and see why Hollywood had made so many movies here recently.",5
Restaurants,"I really don't expect much out of a food-court place, but even so, this place was pretty disappointing.

First off, I was planning on ordering a brisket plate with mac-and-cheese and hushpuppies, and an iced tea. They were out of brisket, out of mac-and-cheese, and had discontinued the hushpuppies even though they were still on the menu. Oh yeah, and there was no iced tea and no ice (they did refill the ice). So zero percent of what I wanted was available.

I ended up ordering pulled chicken, with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. The chicken was pretty dry and tasteless, even with the rub, and the sauce was pretty bland. The mashed potatoes were old, and had some kind of weird skin (not a potato skin, more like the skin you see on pudding). The corn on the cob was actually ok.

To their credit, they did give me a discounted price because of everything being unavailable.

If you're stuck eating at the food court at the outlets, I'd suggest going to one of the safer places, like the Chinese place, or the sandwich place.",1
Restaurants,Van is a huge asset to this business.  He is always friendly & helpful.,5

Restaurants,Fact: All the food comes from Walmart!,1
Restaurants,"I agree with the other reviews that the sides are lacking, specially in flavor. Pork and brisket were surprisingly good and I really liked the chipotle BBQ sauce.",3
Restaurants,"I don't normally feel the need to write a review, but we stopped in to grab some ""memphis rub bbq"" the other day while passing through. Sounded good, slow-roasted memphis rub bbq, right??.  NOT.  This was without a doubt nothing more than boiled meat with regular bbq sauce on top. Bland, watery, stringy boiled meat. The entire family felt the same way. I think what bothers me the most is the very obvious lack of care and effort in making ""bbq"" and then charging $9 for a ""platter"" that consists of scant portions of ordinary potato salad (walmart or costco came to mind) and a few tablespoons of baked beans (which were the best part of the meal). I don't like being ripped off, and definitely felt this place is out to rip off people. NO effort whatsoever to try and make realy bbq.This is NOT slow roased ""memphis rub bbq"". It is boiled meat in water. Horrible.",1
Restaurants,"BBQ sauce was good and so were the sides. A bit of sweet and a bit of spice. Not bad at all and we will be back. The sides are a bit lacking, but, add more sauce to the beans and they're MUCH better. Try the coleslaw on the pulled pork...very nice.",3
Restaurants,Horrible service!  Waited 45 mins just to order and we are the ONLY customers here. Terrible nut from reading the reviews I am happy to take my business elsewhere.,1
Restaurants,"Blah, bland, flavorless pulled chicken. Needs bar b que sauce to make it edible. Brisket was probably boiled as well. Corn on the cob was mooshy. Mashed potatoes were of the instant flavor variety.. Service was friendly. Won't eat here again.",2

We picked our own painting to paint, but typically, the artist has one piece of art that everyone paints and the artist goes over each step with you to completion.  Staff is very nice.  Good deal.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"A couple of friends and I went to Paint and Party last night and had a BLAST!  The women there were great hostesses and helpful as instructors.  We all left there with paintings we were proud to call our own.  Everyone is planning on going back with more friends as well as our kids.  I highly recommend this fun, creative experience!",5
Arts & Entertainment,went with my girlfriend and we convinced out boyfriends to come!  it was so much fun.  we all brought wine and painted pix and just had a lovely time.  we totally took over. it was small and the staff was so friendly.  Love it.,5
Arts & Entertainment,Had my daughters 10th bday party there and it was great. I  would recommend this place to anyone..,5
Arts & Entertainment,"What's really amazing about paint and party is that you can go there was no artistic ability whatsoever and still come away with a great painting.  I had never painted before in my life but the instructors walk you through step-by-step so that you really can't make any kind of serious mistake.  The end result is that you have a painting that you can actually impress people with.

As far as it being a party, that depends on whether you go as a group or whether it's just you and a friend.  If it's just you and a friend it's going to end up being more of a painting class than a  party.  But it's still an enjoyable time and I highly recommend it.",5
Arts & Entertainment,I have been to Paint and Party numerous times and love it more and more every time!! Donna is amazingly helpful and always has a smile! The Morelli's love love this place and will continue going!!!,5
Arts & Entertainment,This is a fun and unique way to play in Las Vegas. The instructor was wonderful at giving guidance and direction as we completed our masterpieces. She was great at reminding us it was about having fun. All the supplies and materials were provided (except the bottle of wine). It was fun to be able to leave with a nice painting to hang on the wall as a memento. A great place that I would recommend to anyone visiting Vegas. A great alternative to the hustle and bustle of The Strip.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"This was such a fun experience! It was our first time ever doing this since art class in 3rd grade!

We worked with Donna during ""open paint"" and had such a nice time. We went during an afternoon and timed it perfectly so we had the place to ourselves (we didn't want to be amongst children).  It was like our own private studio and private lesson. 

They supply everything from ideas/inspiration to canvas, supplies, and smocks.  We did not have to set up or clean up, it was awesome! The music was relaxing and we were in our own little world. 

Although you cannot drink alcohol here, that was not a problem. There is no time to drink and I realized that even if I did have a glass of wine at my painting station, I would not drink it because I wouldn't want to screw up my painting and my paint brush would probably end up in my wine glass! We had brought our own waters and I maybe took two sips in the 3 hours we were there. I was so focused, I forgot to hydrate!  However, we did go have a drink afterwards! 

If you have questions or concerns just call them, they are super friendly and very accommodating.",5
Arts & Entertainment,I had so much fun painting for the first time!  Donna is so sweet and helpful!  This is such a fun activity to do with friends or with a date.  I would definitely do this again!,5
Arts & Entertainment,"I haven't picked up a paintbrush since like, Kindergarten, but this was so much fun!  I was a little intimidated at first, but with help from Donna and Matt, I created a painting that I am very proud of.  Relaxed, fun environment and you can create whatever you wish - you don't have to stick with the ""painting of the day"".  

My friend and I went over the scheduled time, but Donna and Matt were willing to stay the extra few minutes and help us to finish up so we wouldn't have to come back another day - that was very nice.  I love that all the set up and clean up is done for you and also that they have a permanent studio instead of mobile locations.  

The only improvements I would make would be to have the ""instructors"" do more instructing - there were times I felt a bit lost and there were 8 or 10 of us to just 2 instructors and everyone was painting something different so all of us were looking for individual help.  But when I DID get the help, Matt was great about showing and demonstrating the different strokes and techniques that I wanted to achieve.

A very fun girls night and I look forward to bringing my kiddos here - they will love it!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"My wife and I came here in July 2013.  Although neither of us had much experience painting, with Donna's guidance we produced paintings better than we expected we were capable of.  The price was extremely reasonable as well.  I highly recommend for children, adults, couples, parties, etc.  Hope to be back when next in Vegas.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"My first and only experience with Paint and Party was at the Yelper Party: 89XXXhibition Event.  

They were set up immediately to the left when you walked in, so it was hard not to miss.  When we arrived, no one was painting yet as I think most people were a bit shy to be first.  But by the time we returned, there was definitely a wait to get a seat.

They had small canvases set up, along with a smock to keep your clothes clean and they provided you with all the other necessary materials like paint colors, paper towels, and paintbrushes.  This was an open painting session - so you can paint whatever you wanted.  The staff walked around to assist you with any other things you might need and were quick about getting each station set up for the next person waiting.

The Husband and I had such a great time and spent most of our evening here.  As a result, we started looking into other painting activities.  I recently came across their brick and mortar location on Eastern near the Regal Colonnade Theater.  They also do private parties and can bring everything to you.  The Husband spent a bit more time talking to the staff and thought they were great.  Definitely a company we'll consider visiting again.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I came here for my girl friend's birthday. She decided to celebrate her bday in a deferent way this year. It was my first time to paint on canvas.  Everything was prepared before we arrived. (Brushes, color paint, canvases) I have to admit I have no talent in drawing, painting and whatever. However, instructor made everything seemed easy! She showed us step by step. Time went fast. An hour and half passed, and I had my first painting in front of me. It came out pretty good! I was very proud of myself. Everyone in our group had tons of fun. We all got a very good deal from groupon. Class was hold inside Havanna. So, I got to eat, drinking sangria, and paint at the same time. It was a great experience!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I have now been to their studio two times for painting parties.   The first time I went it was taking my daughter to a kids painting party.  I was very impressed at the amount of time and patience they gave to each and every kid (Party of 14).  We had kids (ok adults too) who were afraid to pick up the brush and swore they cant even draw a stick man. (Yes that was me the adult).   Donna gives such clear instructions that there is no way you can not turn out your very own masterpiece!     

The second time i went it was an adult ladies party.   I had a little more confidence this time around and tried something a little more daring.   Yes I did a beach scene.   I just knew I was going to come home and toss it in the trash.    That painting is now hanging in my husbands office at his work.    Even I am proud of the work that I was able to create.    

Now understand none of this is something I could have or would have done alone.   Donna is wonderful and showing a stroke and then letting you do it.   She helps you to think outside of the box!    

Thanks Paint and Party, I look forward to visiting you again!",5
Arts & Entertainment,This is the first time I had done this and had a lot of fun.  Went for a bachelorette party and actually painted a fairly good painting for my first time.  Had good instruction. I would definitely do it again.,4
Arts & Entertainment,The artist was very helpful and allowed the group (of 8) to paint different paintings from one another. She balanced the unique demands of each person and supplied paint refills as needed. The vibe is relaxed and a good environment for kids and groups. They are no frills so don't expect wine as most painting parties have.,4
Arts & Entertainment,"Had a great time out with the girls! A great idea for getting together and getting creative! Donna the owner is really helpful and sweet. She let each of us choose which painting we wanted. Great experience, will definitely go back!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I enjoyed my first visit so much, I brought the family with me this time. It was the kids 13th birthday and we ordered pizza which was delivered and had root beer floats for lunch after we did our painting. I wasn't sure if the kids would like it or not. They actually enjoyed it very much.  Each was able to pick their own painting and got personal instruction which was great. They said they would want to do it again.  Success!!!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Paint and party was TURNT. Had a blast with the squad, Donna was down, she's awesome. Come through for a good time! It's lit fam.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I came here for a private party and had a blast. Donna was the hostess and had everything all set out for us when we arrived.

On this particular outing we were painting glasses. There were several types of paints (the types escape me) and various sizes brushes. Donna gave us templates to choose from, tips and tricks, and encouraged our artistic creativity to flow. She also was quick to grab extra paint, brushes, alcohol, water, whatever we needed.

Classes can be private or you can walk on. There are various mediums to choose. Various paint patterns. Stencils too!

Definitely a fun and creative way to spend an evening or an afternoon. Donna is great! Definitely a great studio and warm, friendly environment.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"My husband and I came to this plaza for the movie and diner, we stumble up this secret spot for art lovers. The paint workshop has everything I need to paint a picture of my choice, great place to spend some time, for yourself/with friends or they host parties too. Good for all ages, you will get all the help and advise or just do your thing. Will definitely be back.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Donna, the owner, is very sweet. She is extremely helpful and allows you to be creative. It's nice that you can choose what painting you'd like to do. It's also cheaper than other painting studios.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"If you're looking for an unique painting party experience, this is the place for you. I have no desire to check out the other wine and canvas places bc they always look packed, over priced and everyone is doing the same picture...boooring. At paint and party you can walk down the hallway and check out all the paintings; see what inspires you. Or you can create your own masterpiece straight from your noggin. If you want lots of help it's available, or if you're more of a solo painter and just need someone to change your water and refill your paints then that's available too. I've been here 4 times and it's one of my favorite places; great for birthdays, dates, and Mother's Day. I recommend it to everyone.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Considering my less than glowing feelings about the ""Immortal"" show, I wanted to see if anything could be salvaged out of this rush of new MJ related entertainment.  So in order to try to find some sort of balance and sense out of this experience, I tried this ""Fan Fest"".  Was this truly ""for the fans""?

I'd have to say ""Yes"".

It's striking how a bunch of inanimate objects and some livelier selections in music tracks could provide a much more entertaining event.  This event focused on costumes, props and sets from his music videos and live performances, numerous awards, and a glittering wardrobe and attention to lavishness that would give even Liberace pause.

Best of all, it was far more interactive than your average self-guided tour.  The staff encouraged you to sit on some of the prop items, and were all too happy to take photos.  The room was alive with Jackson's more pop and rock driven tunes, and while it played a slow song every once in awhile, it wasn't as heavy as the Cirque show was.  This seemed more like a celebration than the actual ""tribute"".

But how could one not be charmed by a recreation of his study with bookshelves and giant chess set, or the popcorn and ice cream trolleys from the Neverland estate, or a sampling of his arcade games, or the massively huge castle, or the Disney created dioramas that used to be in his movie theater?  There were also the lavish interiors of his numerous cars, or the collection of fan art, or people playing the Wii version of ""Michael Jackson: The Experience"".  Seriously, for someone who mourned the loss of his childhood, he had an amazing adulthood.  Or at the very least, he had some REALLY cool things to play with.  I was excited for the chance to play with the few items offered.

But the Fan Fest wasn't as large as I would have hoped (I know, we're never really satisfied, are we?).  After seeing online catalogs of an auction that would have taken place to sell his things years back, this almost felt like the tip of the iceberg of what could have been seen.

Don't believe me?  Here:

http://www.juliensauctions.com/auctions/2009/michael-jackson/catalog-list.html

Some of these things were at the Fan Fest, but you just wanted to experience more.

Regardless, I had fun at this Fest.  To see these things up close, and in select cases, touch them, made for a very personal, informative, and entertaining tour.  It makes me wish that they would just turn Hacienda Palomino (his old stomping grounds here) into a museum, because I think THAT would just be awesome.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Would I have paid the full $30+ per person ticket? Probably not. But I snatched a deal on Living Social for tickets to the Cirque de Soleil show as well as the fanfest- totally worth it. The fanfest is basically a showcase of MJ's props, clothes, memorabilia and more. They have a recreation of his living room, the castle he had made for his house, the video games he had at neverland. 

There were lots of staff and everyone was super friendly and enthusiastic. They were always offering to take pictures of you by the props and music video backgrounds. You could sit in the same chair he sat in- it's all rather nostalgic. The number of sparkly gloves- too many to count, I was distracted by the shiny. 

All in all, a great oppurtunity to see the blood, sweat, and materials that went into Michael's life and music. Check it out.",4
Public Services & Government,Great landfill. Most of its inside and well maintained the only landfill that doesn't stink!!! If your a city of Phoenix residence you are allowed one free dump so go check it out!,5
Public Services & Government,"I can't say I have very much dump experience, but I think this place would spoil a visit at any other dump. It's well organized, the people are friendly and best of all, it doesn't completely reek! The last time I was there, they gave us a friendly reminder that any uncovered load would be fined starting soon. So remember that you must throw a tarp over your stuff, no matter how little!",5
Public Services & Government,What a line on the weekend....the people in the office could be more organized and the rent a cop could stop trying to wave his arms and talk less!  Get people in and out!,1
Public Services & Government,Citizens of Phoenix utilize a benefit that you pay for monthly!!!!  Bring an id and a current water bill and drop your bulk trash monthly!  Thus place is awesome and if you have a child bring them for the display of heavy machinery at work. I love coming here although it is a chore it removes unwanted bulk items from my home. Time to live yelpers!!!,5
Public Services & Government,"Best freakin dump ever haha. Helpful employees, doesn't stink, and well organized. Seriously awesome!",5
Restaurants,"A good neighborhood Indian restaurant. Food is tasty, service and setting is nice.",3
Restaurants,"This is A-OK Indian food in Verdun. They have quick delivery and the food is ok. Of course I have tasted better, but that would mean that I would need to go to Parc Extension or Downtown to get better stuff. If you live in Verdun, this is a good place to order your take out or delivery from.

I have not actually sat in the restaurant, but I have walked by it, and it seems ok.",2
Restaurants,"Bon resto indien, bon rapport qualité / prix !",4
Restaurants,"WARNING - never eat here.
I went here for dinner with my wife and I don't think we ever had such terrible food. We ordered lamb biryani and mushroon biryani, both dishes were horrible. The lamb meat was stale. We could not eat more than few bites and had to send the food back. Also, the service there is not good, we asked the waiter twice to get a glass of hot water but he never got one. Dishes are very expensive for the quantity they provide.
Finally, it is not an authentic Indian restaurant (even though they use name of New Delhi), but they are actually from Bangladesh.
Don't ever dare to eat here.",1
Restaurants,Worst service ever. They will make cheap replacements without warning you. American cheese has no place in Indian food instead of accepting their mistake they made the same dish again using American cheese again except cut up smaller to try to hide it. Then refused to refund when I decided I didn't want it.,1
Restaurants,"Products are good but preparation and service is so slowwwww... don't trust the indicative time they d give you if you ask, add 50% to it.",2
Restaurants,"Tres bonne nouriture. Souvent nous le commandons par telephone et allons le chercher. 

Avons mange quelques fois sur place. Deco sympathique. Sieges moins confortables avec les coussins. Mais la nourriture vaut la peine.",4
Restaurants,Ordered a take away twice.  The pizzas were extremely delicious. The smoky flavour of the tandoori meats was delightful. Indian food however was mediocre. Nothing for which you might want to make a special visit since it's not cheap either.,3
Public Services & Government,Usually in the past they have been pretty fast and getting people through.  At least that has been my experience. I'm here several times a year relating to my daughter.  Today is not that case. They have more windows then I have evr seen open at once with sllllooowwweesstt service I have ever seen.,3
Public Services & Government,If you need a replacement card..save yourself the time and go to the Buffalo location.  Wasted 45 Minutes here.  Put that on your memo board!,1
Public Services & Government,"Went all the way there on a Wednesday at 2:00 PM (the middle of the week) and they were closed.  For no reason and with no warning on the website, they close at noon on Wednesdays.",1
Public Services & Government,"It's Social Security so obviously expectations on customer service is already low to begin with but during my recent visit to this office, the customer service I experienced was beyond contempt. I usually don't like pointing fingers cause I think it's unfair but I feel that it's important to be specific or else my experience would fall on deaf ears. Beware not to get the customer service representative that speaks with a Spanish like accent, she was continuously condescending and belittling to the point I had to summon a supervisor since the miscommunication got so bad that I couldn't communicate with this person on a intelligent level.  You would think that people employed here would have some type of customer service qualification or have a social service background that requires a certain level of compassionate and sympathetic demeanor since their position requires everyday contact with people, I honestly don't know how this particular Social Security person I had the unfortunate luck of transacting with at this office gets hired here, it is so blatantly obvious that this line of work is not suited for this female representative. I won't need to post any pictures or names, if you have trouble understanding her and feel like she is condescending than you will know who I'm talking about.",1
Public Services & Government,"Sick Sadistic Bureaucratic Clowns run this place. The ""security guard"" plays with his ""smart phone"" and is not very aware but packs a .45. Not very smart haha...I'd fire him, incompetent. One man was with his grandad trying to get help filling out forms due to inability from a seizure disorder, denied assistance. Another man on oxygen was having a difficult time with another SSA worker just to get copies of a few medical records to submit and was told ""we don't make copies"" right after he copied something. He told the SSA man ""If you can't do your job then find a new job.""  My 90 year old mother was denied my assistance to help her understand and hear and is hearing and physically impaired. My sister was denied my assistance and is also disabled. I was told to sit down and was denied my right to help my family understand and go through a process that we pay for through taxation. They used repeated threats of calling the security guard on myself and others that were there for help. One SSA woman was talking about my sister, making snotty derogatory untrue statements within her presence. When I confronted her, she demanded I leave the room and I did so and said ""I am writing you up"", pointing to the woman and walked out. There was no provisions or concerns for people which are disabled and there were many there including my family. The wait time was 1.5 hours in the first line. Total time was about 3 hours. Government.",1
Public Services & Government,"If I could give zero stars I would. I arrived 30 minutes prior to opening and the line was already long and out the door. 
I waited 45 minute once doors opened to get up to front lobby to see a hand written sign that says no cards here, must go to South Buffalo location. Maybe, just maybe, they should put that out by front door so as to not waste people's time. Totally ridiculous. 
***no social security cards cards issued here***",1
Public Services & Government,"Yelp has the location incorrect. The Yelp map took me about 2 streets south of where the office is located. The office is off of Eastern and Coronado Center Dr, not Eastern and Sunridge Heights. It is in the same plaza as Hooters, U-Swirl, Massage Heights etc. and NOT in the plaza by Egg Works. 


Anyways, on to my review! I got there about 10:30am, and was out of there by noon. I was expecting to be there for much longer, because the place was packed when I arrived, but was thrilled to be in and out in less than 2 hours. I'm not sure how their wait system works, because some people who were there before me were still there when I left. And some people who arrived after I did were out of there before I was. 

But the man at the check in desk and the lady that helped me at the window were both nice and respectful towards me, so that's awesome! (And hence the 4 stars) The only thing I didn't like was how you have to tell the person at check in your SSN. People in line behind you can probably hear.",4
Public Services & Government,"Went to this location to register for Social Security. Three hours before we were out the door. Got home and had a call from the woman that helped us and she informed us that she did the paperwork wrong. She said we should pay this incorrect amount ($200 too much per month) until Social Security catches it, and sends me a refund. WOW.....she must have a lot more money than I do.
The thing she did wrong, was something we brought to her attention three times while we were there. She kept insisting that she was right and we were wrong. Now, because of her mistake we have another 100 hoops to jump through!",1
Public Services & Government,"Social security cards,  names changes,  citizenship updates are done at the 1250 S BUFFALO Dr office.",5
Local Flavor,"Want to know the steepest street in the world?  Is it Lombard Street in San Francisco?  No, it's right here in Pittsburgh and it's Canton Avenue!  Canton Avenue is an obscure little street tucked into a corner of Beechview.  It's a block long between Hampshire Street and Coast Avenue.  There is a northern stub, blocked off by Jersey barriers, but what it once led to, I have no idea.   I passed by it when I had to do a site visit for work and I thought, ""Holy macaroni!""  The second drop on Kennywood's Phantom's Revenge doesn't seem as steep as this!  And I always thought nearby Boustead Street was bad!  

So when I came home, I looked it up.  Did you know that Canton Avenue has its own entry in Wikipedia?  According to the entry, Canton Avenue has a grade of 37%.  That means in 10 ft of horizontal distance, the elevation changes by 3.7 feet.  Let's look at it another way.  The Mon Incline has a grade of 35 degrees, 35 minutes.  The Duqusene Incline has a 30 degree angle.  Okay, so I exaggerated on the Phantom's Revenge--that ride has a 46 degree angle drop.  

No matter, this street is almost gravity-defying!  Could you imagine going down this on ice and snow?  Or trying to get up it with a manual transmission?  Could one of those little Smart Cars even make it up this thing?  

Or imagine this hill in horse-n-buggy days!

Just go to Google Maps, type in the above address, go to ""Streetview"" and follow Canton Avenue downhill.  You'll see!

UPDATE 02/28/2012:  I had a look at Streetview on Google Maps.  This street is so steep, you cannot drive downhill on it.  Halfway down the block from Hampshire Ave, there are ""Do Not Enter"" signs.  Presumably this is to allow access to the few houses via the easier (easier being a relative thing) grade from Hampshire Ave.",5
Local Flavor,One scary street! Don't drive down it unless you want to wreck your car!,1
Local Flavor,"Yeah it's steep, but it can be safely driven. Definitely keep off this street if its A: Snowing, 2: going to snow, C: you've been drinking, 4: you plan on drinking, E5: you have vertigo, E5b, you plan on getting vertigo and finally, 6: you're planning on selling the car you use to travel this hill. It's a unique part of Pittsburgh and its he land upon which the city is built.",5
Local Flavor,"Hmm. One star or five stars? One star for being absolutely dangerous. It is such a ridiculous grade that, yes maybe it should be illegal. How would you even access it at all in the winter? There are people living on this street but it would be completely impossible to drive up or down with snow on it. Actually believe it or not, it's even too steep to drive on it when it's wet. Driving down it Is actually illegal, but do it anyways to get the full experience. 

I shall give it five stars. For being the steepest street in the world. For its vast amount of character. Character above practicality in this case. It's an old cobblestone street that is not very kept up. You could argue that that is a bad thing. Nah, I say. More character. Where but Pittsburgh would you find a street like this?",5
Local Flavor,"To the reviews who say this street is too steep to drive on and give it one star, I say ""duh"". 

I found this spot thanks to Atlas Obscura. After decades of traveling back and forth to the Pittsburgh area to visit family I'm constantly looking for new opportunities to explore. 

Yes, it does appear to be the steepest street in America with 37% grade. 

No, there are not any markers or signs for those of us liking to learn more. Womp womp.",3

Public Services & Government,It was super quick to get a marriage license here. Came in at 8:23 and left by 8:40. All it took was a little money and a few moments away from my drivers license now I'm inches away from being married.

Restaurants,"S'il est vrai que pour moi l'ambiance d'un restaurant est importante, très même, à quoi peut servir une belle déco et une vue imprenable sur le tarmac et sur les avions (hey pour ceux qui comme moi adorent l'aviation c'est génial), si la nourriture est moyenne?
Ce restaurant est un vrai «attrape touriste» alors un conseil: Mangez AVANT d'entrer dans la zone réglementé, mangez chez vous, ou encore... attendez sagement votre repas d'avion.... c'est à peu près pareil!",2
Restaurants,"Si j'étais vous j'éviterais. La qualité de la nourriture est mauvaise, le service précipité et les prix élevés pour ce qui est servis. Pour moi ce n'est pas même pas du niveau de la cafétéria d'école et pire que de la nourriture d'avion.",1

J'ai fait quelques visite à la Cabine M. La première fois j'étais déçu de la qualité du burger avec la galette sèche. Lors de ma dernière visite, j'avais plusieurs heures à passer, j'ai donc décidé, de prendre mon temps. J'ai commandé du vin et le plateau de charcuteries (charcuteries et fromages). Ce fut un excellent choix pour attendre tranquillement mon vol avec un livre.

J'ai aussi goûté aux raviolis aux fromages. Tout simplement divin!! De bons raviolis dans une superbe sauce à la crème, aux champignons shiitake,  au porto et au canard confit. J'en salive juste à y penser...

Pour le désert j'ai pris une tartelette au chocolat, c'était correct sans plus.

Public Services & Government,"The worst ever experience in a government office I had to encounter. I went on a  Friday at 2:30 PM assuming that the crowd will be less. There was a small line outside with 3 people on front of me. I waited for 20 mins and the lady let 3 people in front of me, but said she can't do ITIN today since it too late. Seriously lady, there is about 1.5 - 2 hours more for the day and there are only about 5-6 people waiting and you can't take anymore?? I went again on Tuesday, there was a long line of 25 people in front of me. I waited for 2.5 hours and finally got my chance. I go in there and she says that I have to get the tax document signed from my wife and she can't certify my mom's passport. I asked what does my mom's passport attestation have to do with my wife signing the tax return. I begged her to certify the passport (I had my mom as well available physically all the time) and I will send the document through certified mail. She refused and said come another day.

Please find another IRS office if possible.",1
Public Services & Government,"Unlike previous reviewers, I had an excellent experience here. My Canadian mother's 2014 refund had been delayed forever.  Phoning the IRS was only a waste of time.  After dealing with three different agents in Austin and a supervisor, we were still unable to break the logjam.  The grump at the local IRS ""advocate's"" office was only interested in telling me what I couldn't do, not how I might resolve the problem.  She basically told me I would have to drag my 83-year-old mother from northern Canada to an IRS office to make anything happen.

Raul Corella, at the Mesa IRS office, was a godsend.  Because I was listed on the original tax return as being allowed to participate in the process, he was able to look up the information and finally tell me what the problem was.  Our local IRS guy was more knowledgeable and more helpful than anyone I dealt with at the main office in Austin, TX.  Thank you, Raul!",5
Public Services & Government,"I had to renew my health card.  I had my paper work ready when I got there. As usual, they didn't have all their windows open to accomodate people faster (just like the dmv). When I got there my # was 20#'s from being called and it took approx 50 min. Once my # was called I was only at the window for a moment to show my paperwork, I didn't have to get a Hep A test since I've had one before from the last time I got my health card.  What I was surprised about was that they send you to another window to then pay for your card. They should be able to handle the paperwork AND the payment at the same time just like the DMV to speed things up a little.  When I went to the other window to pay, there were 4 people in front of me and I waited almost 15 min (it was a very slow line).  There was no reason that it should've taken that long since at that point paperwork is in hand and you're either paying cash or card.  

So after I paid I went to another window to get my card which at that point only took a minute or two.  

All in all I was there about 1 hr 15 min which I GUESS isn't too bad especially since you don't have to stay and watch the old boring 2 hr video anymore. I definitely like that it can be done online and the video/exercises are very current.  

I definitely have to mention that when I moved here in 1993, the price of a health card was $10.  Today's price is $50 which is totally ridiculous, especially since it's only good for 3 yrs.",3
Public Services & Government,Worst experience ever. Drove across town because this located stated they take people up until 5pm and I had rushed over here after class. I was denied at the door before that time. Please don't have state  you take people before 5 when you don't.... Waste of gas time and effort,1
Public Services & Government,"PRETTY DAMN FAST

I came here to re-new my health card & i will have to say it was the FASTEST i have been just in & out considering the fact that it was almost closing time as well. I got everything done & walked out w/ my card within 15 minutes! *bravo*

The staff aren't nice but not mean... they just do their job & want to get the day over with.

I drove HELLLA far from where i live for some reason because i couldn't remember the other location i went too... this was also where my stupid car navigation led me too...

I will probably NEVER be back to this location ONLY because of the distance from me! hahahaha but they were open the latest so i think that was also the reason for my going here.

ALSO you have to pay extra if you re-new your health card AFTER the expiration date!",3
Public Services & Government,"Thanks To The Carelessness Of The Heath District we are now being evicted. They told us that a landlord can not evict you for nonpayment of rent due to mold in the bathroom and kitchen also a sewage leak in the front yard after sending him a letter and 14 days later still doesn't attempt to fix the problem he can't evict you. WRONG!

Turns He Can! The Judge told us in order for him to fix the mold and sewage leak in the yard that we would have to pay him the rent in 24hr. or be evicted and even then he doesn't want us here. So we would still have to move out and he doesnt have the fix the mold or sewage. That's Great Now He Can Rent It Out Again like this and noone cares.",1
Local Flavor,Nice event. Lots of great craft beers from out of state.,4
Local Flavor,A fine addition to the bevy of alcohol related festivals that make Old Town Scottsdale such a great place to be. This one is new and will surely get bigger and better each year.,5
Local Flavor,Awesome! Best day ever!,5
Local Flavor,"This beer festival is always a great time.  The location is really nice at the Scotsdale Civic Center. There are plenty of trees to hang out under while trying all the awesome beers and it's never obnoxiously crowded.  The beer/event staff are always cheerful to those wandering around trying all the beers. They also have plenty of food trucks and live music to keep you happy all afternoon long. The only minor negative has to be the beer servers are just hired to hand out beer and to that end some some of them don't know a whole lot about the beer you are trying.  Which isn't a huge deal you either like it or not I guess.  If there is one beer festival to check out in the Phoenix area it is this one. It's always a good, good time.",5
Local Flavor,"Where else can you go with friends and have a great time?  Then to make this wonderful even better was the weather was perfect.   The samples of beers mostly great, just like everything else some were "" really you call this beer""?  Met alot of new people. Thank you for such a great event.",5
Local Flavor,A labyrinth of beer!  The live music was great and there was something for everyone! Djs for those that want the boom boom music and some great live bands to dance to! And the beer. What can I say about the beer other than there was a lot of it. And most of them were great. I am a fan of IPAs and they had some of my favorites. Ballast point sculpin. Try it. Seriously.,5
Local Flavor,"The Ameri-Can Canned Beer Fest is shaping up to be one of the best craft beer events in the valley.  With the addition of live, local music like Catfish Mustache and Dry River Yacht Club and a larger offering of food vendors this beer fest that encircles the Scottsdale Civic Complex becomes more of an event.  Not that over 250 different canned beer offerings aren't enough to come out for! 

I have to give a special shout out to The Draft Sports Grill at 1130 W. Grove Ave in Mesa...thanks for the free sliders and wings, they hit the spot!

The Ameri-Can fest is a great event to get out to try some of our great local brewers, most of them are pouring there, as well as brewery offerings from across the country provided by our local Arizona beer distributors and select local venues. 

http://cannedcraftbeerfest.com/",4
Local Flavor,"Best year to date helped along by the great weather and the Dry River Yacht Club who killed it.  It was my first time seeing them and they were really groovy, creative, fun, and talented.  Really a Bassoon player??  :)

The beer vendors were exceptional as always welcoming discussion and good pours.  The value for the overall festival is amazing considering everything is paid for up front with the exception of food which you get from the trucks.  

Many of the top notch breweries were represented including Ballast Point , Marble, Santa Fe Brewing, Ska, Firestone, and many more.  For $35 it was a great deal and I never waited in a line more than two deep.  

Bathrooms were always available and the general vibe was relaxed and chill.  Great job Ameri-CAN and I will be back year after year!",5
Local Flavor,This was a great festival and I highly recommend it if you like craft beer. The location was fantastic with lots of space and placed to sit while enjoying your beer. There were more than enough drink coupons to enjoy what you wanted to try and the breweries often were there themselves rather than volunteers. Always a good sign. I'll be back again next year.,5
Local Flavor,"This was such a fun fest!  One of the best ones we've been to.  The breweries were well stocked and prepared for a crowd.  The wait time was minimal, the weather was perfect and the bands were awesome!  Excellent planning!",5
Public Services & Government,"Very pretty building located in old town chandler if thats what you call it. So I happened to ask the nice lady behind the desk where can I get some coffee and she directs me way out of my way... so this building is full of office workers that work for the city and there are other city offices in the vicinity, and you are telling me that ther is no coffee anywhere in walking distance???? Whats up with that????",3
Public Services & Government,"Its is a pretty building near lots of places to eat. However no one who works at city hall doesn't have a recommendation for anything! Lame! I was hoping for a spectacular place to eat at while in this neck of the woods.....disappointed. Oh well, on my own I shall venture",3
Public Services & Government,"I'm going to tell you a secret so listen closely! If you are in need of a Passport City of Chandler is the place to go! 
They offer services Monday to Friday 8 am to 4pm no appointment necessary, can you believe that?   Did you schedule an appointment weeks in advance with the local post office?? I almost did!

I was in need of a passport and had my forms all filled out went down on a Friday morning, thought there was going to be a wait, but nope there was none, unfortunately I didn't have all my ducks in a row, so I had to go back home but found what I needed and headed back this time around noon. Again no wait, got right in. turned in my paper work and was out within 15 minutes!  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly, so if you need a passport or renewal go head on down to City of Chandler!

Just a helpful tip, it makes things more smoothly, have your paper work filled out before you get there.  You can find your needed forms here: http://travel.state.gov/passport/forms/ds11/ds11_842.html",5
Public Services & Government,"I could have printed the completed form off and brought it in but didn't understand that was an option cuz this was the first time applying.  But fwiw the ladies here were polite and helpful in getting me pointed in the right direction.
The expedited process is supposed to take between two and three weeks.  I hope that pans out ahead of schedule since I'm headed out of town at that three week mark.
Want to say parking right along Arizona Avenue made accessing this place so much easier (quicker) than using the parking garage.  For some, parallel parking is not a learned -or mastered skill, so maybe they should park elsewhere because there is traffic going by this parking area.  One of the other options is the parking garage which does provide covered parking -SHADE, almost a must in the hot summer months.  So even those it's maybe a block away at least you can park without testing your parking skills  ---too much.
Keep in mind, parking garage is like many others and high profile parking isn't going to work here.
There is a lot right across the street.  And all three locations are FREE!",4
Public Services & Government,The most pleasant and helpful experience I have had anywhere in a long time. I am so happy and wish I had a reason to return just so could leave happy again. Thank you.,5
Public Services & Government,"Came over from the US Post office down the street to this Passport city hall location! What a difference!! The worker named Ivan has be super helpful and pleasant. If you need a passport, renewal or anything regarding a passport this is the place. Be sure to ask for Ivan he is highly knowledgable and helpful ;)",5
Public Services & Government,"I went in to get a passport this week and thought I'd be late but as long as you sign in before a certain time they will take you. Just make sure you get there before 2:50ish (if you have all your documentation). 

The guy that was helping me was so kind and efficient and not just to me, but to everyone he helped. He was calm and patient with anyone's questions

What helped me, was knowing I could write personal checks rather than bringing in money orders. You need one check/money order  for the federal fee and a separate check to pay to the city of Chandler - so bring your check book, driver's license, birth certificate and forms completed online (although they have forms there).  Their signage walking you through steps is kinda small but helpful. Made this process so much easier than I thought!!",5
Local Flavor,"Some might say we aren't a very urbanized city, but I beg to differ. Take Food Truck Friday for example. Every Friday, the Phoenix Public Market parking lot is transformed into food truck fun! Misters cool the crowd, a radio station livens up the atmosphere with jams and several food trucks fill the parking lot ready to serve food to hungry Phoenix residents. I visited when Food Truck Friday first started last year and I went back again today. Both times have been a fun-filled foodie adventure! It also helps that Phoenix Food Truck favorites like Short Leash Dogs and Hey Joe set up shop for the day. Today, I only ate at Short Leash because my little cockapoo Harley was the featured dog of the week! After ordering my food, I made my way to one of the several shaded picnic tables and enjoyed the misters, music and a lively environment while I ate the Harley (a spicy dog topped with caramelized onion, chili and whiskey sauce!) This is a go-to lunch spot for anyone in the area from 11 AM - 1:30 PM on a Friday and once you visit, you will soon forget any thought of Phoenix not being urban enough!",5
Local Flavor,"Why'd the chicken cross the road?
To get to Food Truck Fridays in Downtown Phoenix!

I know that all you business Yelpers go out for lunch on Friday's, it's basically a rule if you sit in an office, a cubicle, or behind a desk somewhere from Monday through Friday; don't believe me, check the company hand book you were given on your first day of work. Somewhere between how to comb your hair, what you shouldn't wear, and please don't come in smelling like Nair, you'll find it. While Yelping about your Friday lunch is purely optional, I certainly hope you do ;-)

During your weekly 1 hour exodus into the space beyond the cubicles and plaster walls, ending up in the open air of Food Truck Friday will kick off your weekend right. It's not just for Burger King people, it's time to get it your way! 

Pick your favorite food from, Gourmet Hot dogs with Short Leash, or Mexican with Luncha Libre, Smoothies and Salads with Mojo Bowl, to Pies with Mama Toledos, and Creme Brulee with Torched Goodness. Bring your friends and your favorite gal; they can choose their own favorite too. Don't worry about bringing cash, everyone here will swipe your plastic just as easy.

This is your lunch hour, kick back and forget about work while you're here, if only for 45 minutes. Listen to the DJ's spinning popular music through their thumping sound system while you dine on your fine food. Chill out in the seating area which is cordoned off with misters, fans, and swamp coolers; bringing down the temp from a roasting 108 to a palatable upper 90's. 

This is your Downtown business Yelpers, it's time to kick off those business casuals, and make Friday lunch your own!",5
Local Flavor,"I work right across Central from Food Truck Fridays, so we look forward to walking over there almost every week. My fave is Short Leash Dogs. I'm a vegetarian and happy to say that they do have a veggie dog that you can fix up however you like! Short Leash always has a long line but there are misters and shade so you won't die during the summer ;)
There are a lot of options so it's great if you go with a bunch of people - the only thing missing is a taco truck!!",4
Local Flavor,"This is so much fun! The trucks line a square around the picnic area and everyone chooses where they want to it. I really dig it. The picnic area is swamp-cooler-ed down and it's an enjoyable atmosphere. Everyone from hood rats to high business rollers show up and it's like a little Lion King-esque watering hole, if you will. 

Must try it at least once!",4
Local Flavor,"Get yourself down to Food Truck Friday! 

My DH and I and our 7 year old grandson hit FTF (Food Truck Friday) this last week as there was no school for the kiddo that day. We aren't from around here, well we are, kind of, lately. We typically don't do well in really hot weather, but the reviewers from Yelp, even though I know they think 90 degrees is bearable, made mostly favorable comments about the seating, lots of shade, misters, fans.. so off we went. Thanks, fellow yelpers- on this, you were correct, it was remarkably comfortable for a mid summer day.
On the Friday before Labor Day Weekend, we found lots of available parking, Maybe everyone was already checked out of town for the weekend? However, we find Phoneix to be refreshingly uncrowded compared to what we're used to. Ok, so parking seemed to be a snap.

We arrived about 11:30 and there were really no lines and little wait, but we could see those coming. Seating was getting a bit scarce by the time we all got our different meals. Another story, considering a kiddo and a gourmand in tow. We might opt for a bit later arrival as it was thinning out by around 12:45.

Kiddo opted for Pulled Pork Sandwich, DH got Fry Bread piled high with yumminess, I found a couple of corn dogs and fried pickles from Short Leash. Feast!

We're definitley going to do this again (and again). Just thinking about it now makes my mouth water. It was fun, easy, and vendors were friendly and seemed genuinely engaged with customers. Great service, good food and fair value.",4
Local Flavor,"Food truck Friday is excellent! There is a large variety of trucks to choose from and the lines are never that long. The only problem with it is that sometimes it's hard to find a place to sit, but that isn't such a big deal. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you haven't yet.",5
Local Flavor,"This may be too 90's for y'all, but fo' sho', FTF is the Shizzle.

All them yummy trucks all lined up to serve us.  Foodgasms left and right.

If I worked downtown, I'd be there EVERY Friday.

Thanks to the Food Truck Coalition for doing this !!!",5
Local Flavor,"Awesome selection of food and great prices. Love the community feel and now that the weather is nice, it's even better. Get outside and enjoy some great local food.",5
Local Flavor,"Beep Beep!  Who's got the keys to my jeep?  Vroooom! (Missy ""Misdemeanor "" Elliott)

Food Truck Friday happens, well, every Friday in downtown Phoenix.  Located off Pierce and Central the the food truck phenomenum has arrived in Phoenix.  Thank you Great Food Truck Race on Food Network!  Actually Food Truck Friday was started by the Phoenix Street Food Coalition.  If you didn't know, Phoenix lags behind in the food truck scene like Los Angeles, New York, Portland, etc.  Who knew huh?  Yeah, like you didn't know!

The area where this event happens is not very big.  Seating is a B-I-T-C (shut your mouth!) I'm not even going to bring up the Shaft!  However, come early enough and maybe you'll get lucky.  Some people to do the ""I'm saving these seats for a friend"", thing, which really really is annoying!  

Needless to say the scene is awesome!  Hot dogs, burgers, pizza, rice bowls, and cajun burritos!  I guarantee you'll come back for more and to explore the different flavors!  You definitely won't have all Friday to do so, but check out their daily weekly schedule - http://www.downtownphoenix.com/blog/tag/food-truck-fridays/ - Enjoy!",4
Local Flavor,"When the weather is nice there is absolutely no better place for lunch!  The food trucks are one of the reasons my husband and I wanted to move downtown, and having them all in once place is nice! So many options, and everything is good, you really cant go wrong!
I recommend a luncha-rita from luncha libre, really great iced tea flavors!",5
Local Flavor,"I live and work in Peoria, so It's a rare occasion that I get to make it out to Food Truck Friday. When I am able to, I jump at the chance. It's a rough life being a food truck junkie and being banished to the West Valley, let me tell you.
Anyhow, there is not much wanting here. My only difficulty is choosing which trucks to buy from. I love Torched Goodness, and I'm always up for Short Leash. But there are intruiging things going on over at Hey Joe's and Mama Toledo's. 
There is lots of seating, something that is lacking when you come to the market on Saturday. 
My only sadness is that I can't get here very often.",5
Local Flavor,"Feels like part-carnival, part-picnic, and part-mall-food-court!    I've rarely eaten in one of those places and was disappointed!  

This is Phoenix's amazing stab at the good life of trucking good food that Food trucks in places like NYC provide.  In my opinion, Phoenix knocks it out of the park!   The event happens every Friday during the lunch time from 11-1:30pm.  The trucks form a perfect rectangle around the tables in the middle, making it easy for you to eyeball your next stop while you chomp down on your food.

Food truck Friday's has been on my to-do-list for a while.  After hearing how good the Jamborritos were at the recent Food TV food truck event that was held a couple Saturdays ago on the coldest day in Phoenix in a couple years, I decided I would check it out and today was perfect at 70 degrees!  :-)  

I came there with a friend and a very highly opinionated 3 y/o who is ripe for a Yelp! account of her very own!   So, we visited the Short Leash Dogs to get the 3 y/o's meal outta the way!  

We walked around the perimeter of the trucks to observe the menus of the other trucks and make mental notes of where we wanted to visit the next time.  Our mission was to try the Jamborrito's from Jamborrito!  The food there didn't let us down.  What I like best about each truck that we stopped by to say ""hi"" and read the menus is that EVERYone is so friendly and chatty.  I like talking and I love chatty people.

For those that are visiting and are not familiar with the parking situation in that area, there is some street parking.  there is a strange parking lot directly south of the PPM where you can park.  you must pay cash.  Today, each parking space was $6 and you slip the cash in the slot for your parking spot number.  There are other parking lots around, but I don't know on a weekday if those lots are free or paid.  On the weekend, for the PPM, they are free.

My one and only complaint about this place is that there aren't more trucks!   LOL, but other than that, this is such a wonderful and great atmosphere to enjoy.",4
Local Flavor,After a long time I made the venture down to see what all the noise was about.. Food Trucks.. Yeah.. so? Got some Lumpia from Hey Joe.. Checked out the different choices and was amazed at the variety. Can't wait to get time to go back.,5
Local Flavor,"Awesome stuff! Indian fry bread, bacon cheesegurgers, sweet potato fires, peach and brown sugar pies...all in one place! I'll see you there on Fridays!",5
Local Flavor,I wish it were closer.   I love sampling from each truck.   You gotta love when you can have a smoothie and burrito at the same table.,4
Local Flavor,"Have you been to food truck Friday? Have you heard about food truck Fridays? So I guess there is this thing where all the food trucks get together on Fridays? Yeah, I get it. I have heard about it, I guess we should probably go and see what it is all about. I hate being a trendy person but I guess some things you should experience.

The area isn't hard to find using a handy Android GPS. I don't really know my way around downtown Phoenix so I took the A driver role and the driver brought us right in to the parking lot directly north of the trucks. It is as they described. 10 to 12 trucks in a circle around a sizable seating area in the middle. Take a look around. What looks good? The pizza by the slice truck? The jambalaya/burrito concept truck? Vegetarian truck anyone? I recommend picking quickly and sticking with it because the lines are about to get long if they haven't started already.

I have dined at a few of the trucks including the aforementioned jambalaya spot. I am going to talk about the best one so far, though. Luncha Libre specializes in quesadilla and torta concoctions made with meats like carnitas and carne prepared and served in a very tasty combination. I really enjoyed the carne plate with the freshly prepared chips. And don't, don't, don't forget to grab a jar of their original beverages. You get to keep the jar and you get a discount on the next time you visit. And a discount is nice because this truck isn't the cheapest available. I would say go straight to this truck once you arrive so you have the bar set.

Unfortunately this is a review of Food Truck Friday and not just Luncha Libre, otherwise I would be in the 4 to 5 star area. I can't say that I am not to blame in any of the FTF's downfalls. We have to do what we call speed runs just to get the most out of the lunch. If you don't show up early, as in 11:15 or so, prepare to take a long lunch. Make your truck decision and stick to it or else you are in the back of a line cursing your procrastination. If you do find yourself behind in the pecking order expect to be scrambling for seating. If you are with 4 or more people, this could be a bad situation. I don't hate crowds or people but on a lunch I don't want to rush while fighting the masses.

So go do it. Get it out of your system. Maybe you are salary and the suit and tie need some sun. I will say that some of the clientele at FTF are easy on the eyes. Might be a good spot for the single crowd to grab a bite. Just saying. But for this married guy getting paid by the hour and not at lunch, I really need good timing to justify the trip. I can say that I have checked that one off the ole' food bucket list.",3
Local Flavor,"Yeah! We've been experiencing the Food Truck Fridays since last year, and look forward to it every chance we get to go. Me living in the West Valley, don't have many business doing over downtown PHX, but every once in a while we make it our business to go to FTF!!
It gets pretty crowded, the lines can get pretty long, but if you get there early enough as in as soon as they open, then you have no problem, or maybe after rush hour, like 1pm, but they might run out of your favorite dish!
We like Hey! Joe's Lechón, Jamburritos' Cajun food wrapped up in a burrito, Luncha Libre's Mexican-Mediterranean concoctions, Torched Godness' Sea Salt Créme Bruleé, Mama Toledo's Raspberry Cheesecake, Taste Rite's Pulled Pork Po'Boys, etc, etc.
If you get a chance to visit, go!!!",4
Local Flavor,"Luncha Libre has won my heart. Drinks in mason jars? Sold.

Lines are usually long, but so worth the wait. Gotta hurry though, everything shuts down at 1PM.",4
Local Flavor,Everyone should try food truck Friday.  It's fun and there's always something good to eat. Something for everyone.,5
Local Flavor,"I'd never been until today because I work in west Glendale but I had the day off so I thought I'd take the opportunity. It seems such a popular thing that I figured it would be worth it. Ha!

The parking is weird - it's all paid but not really regulated so I'm sure we weren't the only ones that ""didn't notice"" the parking signs. It's also basically in a big parking lot so there was very little shade when you're in line or if you're not lucky enough to snag a chair.
There was a radio station sitting right in the centre of the trucks loudly playing R&B music which I could definitely have done without. I couldn't hear my mom sitting two feet away from me. The entire space was over-crowded and not very organized. Overall, not the best experience. 

A few of the trucks had way longer lines than the others which I thought was weird. Why would you wait in a 30 minute long line for a hot dog when you can just get something else right away? Luncha Libre and Short Leash definitely seemed the most popular, but I went with Emerson Fry Bread (which had NO LINE) because I'm not much for queuing in the hot sun just for food (which I reviewed separately).
We were lucky enough to be able to find two chairs but it's not a sure thing. A lot of people went without. 

I do not get the food truck craze. It's mostly not worth it. Go to a nice air conditioned restaurant downtown instead that's just as locally sourced. There are plenty of them.",2
Local Flavor,"I love food truck Friday. I wish I could get down there more often. It has so many wonderful trucks. I love short leash, the creme brûlée truck, the Korean street food, and so many more. Its great to go with a bunch of people and share the dishes. You get to try so much variety for not a large amount of money. It gets busy, so make sure you get there early to get in line and grab a seat!",5
Local Flavor,"A great place for a group of friends or coworkers who can't decide what to get for lunch. They have hotdogs (short leash), creme brulee (try the salted carmel), and mexican (lunchalibre' - sorry on the spelling). If it's Friday, you'll probably find me eating here. It does get pretty hot in the summer, since all they have for searing it a big shade cover with folding chairs and folding tables underneath.",4
Local Flavor,Torched goodness is delicious single serve creme brulee. A must try. Incredibly tasty.,5
Local Flavor,"Head about it for some time and to day my son and wife invited us to go with them. This is a event I definitely want to go to again. Was a little disappointed as I was hoping for more choices of vendors. The selection was not bad. I chose Jamburritos Cajun Grille. The food was good but I probably will not get a Jamburrito next time. Nothing wrong with the food. It was taste but I am not necessarily a fan of the seasoning in the Jamburrito. Besides there is much more food to try. I also got a pastry from Mamma Toledo's. It was a cheese cake just don't remember what flavor. OH! It was good. 
If you have not done this I suggest you do. It is an adventure. As Forest says Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you are going to get. 
I will wait till it cools of a little. There are tents with evap coolers but it is still going to be warm. 
There are many more trucks around. I must search them out.
Enjoy",4
Local Flavor,"No its not the food truck lots like Portland has but this is very very cool by PHX standards for sure.  Of course I am spoiled living and working in downtown getting the opportunity to try just about every food truck in the Valley who tends to show up here, most in regular rotation, on Friday for lunch.   In the summer it gets a little warm but they have misters and shade which work really nicely while the weather is dry.  There are times in the winter where a few cool days can be an issue, but this is Phoenix people.  For the most part there is little excuse not to eat outside on the regular.  Plus in one location you get to choose from a variety of cuisines and desserts.  This is a must stop for anyone who is a fan of food trucks and good food in general.",5
Local Flavor,One of my favorite things about downtown living. Not sure how I spent $20 for lunch and didn't even have any booze but I did get some Creme Brulee to bring home. I highly recommend this treat.,4
Local Flavor,"Having Fridays off of work makes this spot a perfect start to my weekend.

Alone or with friends I have yet to be disappointed here. Wether a dog from Short Leash (amazing!), pistachio crem brûlée from Torched Goodness or drinks from the ladies at Luncha Libre I always wind up full and satisfied.

I love the fact that most of the food trucks are tech savvy enough that you can use debit/credit at most of them since they use the iPhone/iPad apps that you can charge with. 

Now.. If I can only catch that elusive Mr. Softee I'd be in heaven!",5
Local Flavor,"You can't go wrong with a parking lot full of food trucks.  They have Hot dogs from Short leash Hot dogs, Protein Shacks from Mojo bowl, Burgers from Amore and Pies from Mamma Toledo's.  

This parking lot full of food trucks happens every Friday from 11am to 1pm at the Phoenix Farmer Market in downtown Phoenix.  

Every time I come they have music playing.  Sometimes I will run into friends that I know or it will just be me and my co-workers.  

Normally I get an awesome hot dog from Short Leash.  One of these days I will try something different.  It is just hard for me to not get a hot dog from Short Leash because it is delicious.  :)",5
Local Flavor,Food truck friday was a really neat experience. There were 9 food trucks available today and offered everything from burgers to hot dogs to poboys to ice cream. It appeared a few of the trucks had vegetarian items as well as dairy free items for people with dietary restrictions. I looked at the menu from all of the food trucks and everything looked good. The burger place was by far the most popular with a line of about 20 deep. I tried the jan burritos Cajun truck and it was really good. 1.50 for a can soda was a bit much but the burrito was a large portion and really good. Worth checking out on a friday because there is music playing and its a really nice atmosphere. Only runs from 11-1:30 and it gets busy around noon so try to get there by around 11:30 to avoid longer lines,5
Local Flavor,"I feel like the Elephant in the room saying this but Food Truck Friday in Phoenix sucks.  The experience has disappointed me every single time I've been.

Don't get me wrong, I love supporting the small guys and will happily pay for great food but the value proposition of FTF is terrible.  I guess it's the hipster culture that commands the high prices but it doesn't excuse mediocre food.

Price: Don't expect to leave on a full belly with any less than $20 in your pocket.

Quality of food: I know this solely is on the vendors but I've yet to find a vendor that sells anything that wants me coming back for more.  ALSO don't be a fool like I was and buy something based on the ingredients listed - make sure you SEE what you're getting first.  

One time I basically paid $10 sight unseen for what amounted to a side of curry and rice from a vendor (I hate Indian curry and nowhere on the menu did it sound as if it were a curry). I was very not happy.  There was ""Cambodian"" something in the name which sold me on the ""dish"" (I am Cambodian).  Believe me when I say it was not Cambodian in any way shape or form, not even the rice was right.

The burger vendor is ok, it took forever and the meat was on the verge of rubbery, but at least it was filling.

Short leash is probably the best I've had, they are not bad in the taste department but you are paying $8 for one fancy hot dog all said and done.  No offense intended but they also serve their hot dogs in pita bread.  They call it Naan so they can charge you more for it and sound culturally diverse.

Ambience: It's like a Carnival, and that includes the crowd it attracts and the cleanliness.  Consider yourself lucky if you can find a seat anywhere, let alone a clean spot.  The parking lot is free I think which is super nice for downtown Phoenix.  It is a crappy rock lot though so don't bring your fancy car if you can avoid it.

In conclusion: Do it at least once maybe just for the experience.  If you want to feel like you are expanding your horizons or something go ahead, waste $20 for mediocre food.  I'd much rather eat most anywhere else though.",2
Local Flavor,This is such an awesome thing to do on a Friday night. My girlfriend and her family attended this a couple weeks back and it was great. We had great food at a reasonable price. We will definitely be going back again soon!!,5
Local Flavor,"This was such a great experience and I feel like everyone really should have a Food Truck Friday. Background... every Friday at Phoenix Market from 11:00 am - 1:30pm (give or take), select food trucks come together to serve the people goodness.

I arrived not knowing what to expect. I found a free parking lot (that turned out to be intense getting out of). I walked around to take it all in. Since I was relatively early I wasn't as pressed to hurry up and decide. I did notice a few vendors started before 11am which is nice. There was plenty of seating (including shaded seating) and good music piping in the background. By 11:15, the lines were already starting to form.

I opted for Jamburritos Cajun Grille. I got the house special: Fried Catfish PoBoy with the Creole Cabbage/Cole Slaw with hush puppies. It was fried goodness and definitely filling. I didn't eat all of the bread, but I ate all of the fish. This plate is served with two sauces that really pulled everything together.

I wish I would have found this place sooner. So good. Just note be prepared to wait because they are making it to order so your food is fresh with you in mind.


Tips: 
- Get there early
- Walk around to take in all the sites before deciding
- Order, enjoy
- Repeat and try something else",5
Local Flavor,"I can count on Food Truck Friday when I'm undecided about lunch. Today we got there around 1:10 and I tried Burgers Amore getting their veggie burger and curly fries. The fries were just okay, oilier than I would've liked, but the burger was filling, and I liked that they had the toppings separate so you could customize it. Other times, I've gone to Short Leash Hot Dogs. I used to enjoy The Bear but wasn't feeling it last time. I've yet to try other trucks but the grilled cheese place sounds promising. As long as it's a vegetarian or seafood friendly entree, I'm down. I like that the location is close enough to my work that I can walk and help burn off some of the calories.",4
Local Flavor,"Aside from crazy hot day, I was impressed with Food Truck Friday! 

It was my first time and I can't wait to go back. 

Music was playing, food smelled well from every direction and there were ""misters""!!!! I ended up getting short leash hot dog, no surprise there and also got Mojo smoothie to kill a hot day, at least temporary.

There are for sure many more food trucks that I would go back and try food from...in the mean time, I would recommend this experience for everyone out there. It's a ""must"" thing to do in Phoenix Downtown",5
Local Flavor,"BEWARE THE $12 LAULAU PLATE FROM ISLAND LOCO!  No chicken or fish, the whole container was dripping with fat (I got it all over my clothes and phone), when I opened the taro leaf it was full of big chunks of fat, and the lomi salmon had exactly 3 little diced pieces of salmon.  I took it back for a refund, and he would only refund half the cost.  What a ripoff!",1
Local Flavor,"Went to Food Truck Friday last week and now I'm obsessed. It was way to hot to be outside, but the atmosphere is fun and exciting. Even with the huge fans, it was too swampy. We ate at a taco truck which was okay - the pork was dry, but I will be back when it cools down to try the Indian Fry bread truck. Their food looks great and their Prickly Pear lemonade is crack. I bought a huge one and have been craving it since. Hope I can hold out until Sept. to go back!!

What's great also, is that most of the trucks offer samples so you get to try before you buy. That's helpful when you are stumped at what to order or what might be good.",4
Local Flavor,"The only problem with all these food trucks id deciding which one to go to for lunch. And if you know me, I couldn't narrow it down to one, so I hit two- Emerson's Fry Bread and Hey Joe Filipino...both choices I did not regret...but I regret not having enough room in my bloated gut for more.",5
Local Flavor,With 9 trucks around there was so much to choose from but can't go wrong with the Short Leash Dog,5
Local Flavor,"A dozen or more food trucks, shade, music with a beatiful view of downtown. What's not to LOVE!?! Can't find something you like? The Market Cafe (in the same parking lot) is terrific.",5
Local Flavor,I love food truck friday. You have so many options and the beat customer service. If you are in Downtown on a Friday this is a must go to event. The atmosphere is very inviting. The people who go here are all nice.,5
Local Flavor,Great place to go when you have people with you. There are several trucks to choose from. The reason I say go with friends family or co workers is so everyone can try something different and you all can sample each others goods. The down side about going with a group is that you need to find a place to sit all together.  I love the glass jars of fruit waters one of the trucks sell. You get a big mason jar of fruit infused water that sits ice cold in the truck.  I believe its the Burger Amore truck.  That jar will cost you 5.00. and you get to take home with you to reuse. Be prepared to take a few dollars with you because you do not realize that you want to try everything. Good thing they all take your credit card. Its getting a bit warm out there so dress comfortable and have fun! Oh parking in a dirt lot located north of the trucks. Go at a decent time before it gets packed.,4
Local Flavor,I'm in town for a conference and was able to get food from two different food trucks. I got food from Taste Rite and Horchata from Burger Amore. I got Jerk Shrimp from Taste Rite and it was soooooooooo delicious it came with choice of a side and I chose Mac and Cheese and it was also delicious. Everything was good.,5
Restaurants,Bonne bouffe bonne ambiance,4
Restaurants,"We discovered this place with a voucher - but would definitely go back.

Food : very tasty. The ingredients are of good quality. We ordered the octopus, chorizo, mussels as appetizers and they were all very satisfying. The main dishes are well seasoned and the portions are perfect.
I'd suggest the typical Portuguese dessert served in a verrine - exquisite.
Their wine list is short, but definitely delivers.

Service : our waitress was very attentive and took good care of us. Service was A+

Decor : very simple and modern. Friendly-romantic atmosphere 

This place is appropriate for both small and large groups.",4
Restaurants,Mmm trop bon! Tout ce que j'avais pris était très bon. Je garde surtout un très bon souvenir des palourdes grandes et super goûteuses!,4
Restaurants,"Went here to catch a soccer game, they weren't open but others were in there.  Fantastic fun.  Decided to eat there, had cod fritters, crudo, octopus, and scallops!  Spectacular!  The chef was sure friendly, learned a lot from him regarding food and Portugal.  Great experience, will definitely be returning when back in Montreal.",5
Restaurants,"Just walked in for a tapas sampler and a drink. Sampler was exquisite ! Tuna tartar, wild boat pate and a crackling sweetbread roll. Make sure you stop by!",5
Restaurants,"Excellente adresse.  Les tapas chauds et froids sont vraiment à l'honneur.  Nous avons choisi cinq plats et tous étaient réussis.  Que ce soit les calmars grillés, les poivrons farcis à la morue, la saucisse choriso, les fritas (miam, miam) ou encore les fèves légèrement panées, on s'est vraiment régalé.  L'addition est raisonnable pour la qualité.  Atmosphère détendue.  On y retourne?  Absolumment.",4
Restaurants,Ended up going to Boca Ibercia by chance. Waiter was always there to serve...he was exceptionally friendly and recommended a red wine that turned out to be fantastic. we decided to go with a few tapas instead of ordering main dishes super great idea the octopus was very very good and tender the rapini was fantastic and the stuffed calmar was nice. the atmosphere was very friendly and deafened we will be paying another visit  to Boca Ibercia. I recommend the restaurant and there's a nice terrace.,5
Restaurants,"Bons tapas portugais, rien d'exceptionnel, mais bon.
Par contre, excellentes croquettes de morue et ris de veau exceptionnellement bien apprêtés.
Bon service. Bel endroit. Rapport qualité-prix très bien. 75$ taxes incluses, avant pourboire, par personne, incluant le vin.",4
Local Flavor,"I am one lucky Yelper. First it was Sol Train on Monday now a Spa Night. This was a fantastic event and the greatest opportunity yet to mingle with my fellow Yelpers. Usually I park myself in front of food and booze and whoever is near me is my crowd.

This event was great because we all got to sit around, nibble, chit chat and of course sip some bubbly while waiting to be called for an express offering of some of Mood Swings' services which included chair massages, hand facials (to experience the product on your hands), manicures and make up sessions. I really got in touch with my inner metro and participated in all but the latter.

The salon is great because they have a spa on the ground floor and the actual salon on the second floor which is in one of Tempe's oldest buildings. All of the technicians were super friendly, they have local art on the walls (remaining from Friday Art Walk) and most importantly they play GREAT music.

I am definitely coming back here to get a hair cut so thanks to Lindsey and the folks at Mood Swings for a great event. I really hope we have more events that are so interactive. Don't get me wrong, I love me my food and my booze even more but it was great to really meet and interact with so many cool Yelpers!",5
Local Flavor,"Another Yelp event without a/c? Ugh! Other than that, it was an awesome night and I had a ton of fun. Fantastic chair massage and manicure! And I really enjoyed sampling the wonderful Aveda products. It was lovely to have a such a low key and intimate event in the middle of the week. Thanks to Lindsey and the folks at Mood Swings for such a great event!",4
Local Flavor,"Thank you Yelp for providing me the opportunity to learn about a wonderful local business! 

The General Manager, Brandon, told me all about how Mood Swings Salon is dedicated to giving back to the community as much as possible. They donate their time, money, services and wall space to local artists and the community at large. I never would have known!

We were able to get make-overs, massages with Aveda Chakra aromatherapy, sample facial products and get our nails done! So much generosity! AND we left with a goodie bag with samples and coupons for services. 

While we were there, the salon was fully operational and I was observing the stylists while they worked. They all have a unique style with clothes and tattoos and when their clients were having their hair washed, they received massages and warm towels on their face. Such service!

I can't wait to go back and try out this salon. Thank you Lindsey for introducing me to Mood Swings! 

And sorry for exploding that bottle of champagne everywhere!!!",5
Local Flavor,"It was so much fun getting to know other fellow yelpers at a very fun event last night.  Thank you Andrea S for getting the party started by opening up the first bottle of bubbly!
I am a little challenged when it comes to the make up department so it was really nice to have a pro show me how to create the smoky eye.  The massage was really nice too!  We got to sample some of their products as well during the hand facial.  
The best part was the goody bag.  Thank you guys so much and thank you Lindsey for putting this all together.",5
Local Flavor,"At my second Yelp event ever, I took full advantage of networking with fellow yelpers at the Q&A session (in person meeting) which left a lasting impression. Meeting likeminded individuals seeking world class service anywhere and everywhere leaves one wondering while holding Businesses and Products accountable to excellent service at all times. I am extra precise on whom and where I'd like to spend my time and money particularly in today's economy when times are tough.
 
Yelp at Aveda was nothing less than a successful event starting off with Lindsay; she was a great host!   While mingling with fellow yelpers, we were treated to h'orderves  and champagne - talk about a fountain of knowledge! This was an elite event (I yet have been able to earn the honor), but I am working diligently to do so! So watch out - I am determined to join your inner circle of trust (hopefully it's as good as the circle of trust in Meet The Parents).
But back to Aveda - the building itself has character its down town Mill Ave; historical in nature,  and once you walk in, it's like a breath of fresh air -trendy, hipster meets oasis loft ready to pamper your every whim! Services were marvelous and the goodie bags on the way out were just icing on the cake. I have posted pictures of what the gift bags included! Yes, be very jealous!",5
Local Flavor,"Thanks to Lindsey for another great Yelp event. And thanks to Mood Swings for having us Yelpers. It was a fun night filled with champagne, appetizers and mini spa services. 

The chair massage was great! They were even so nice as to let me get the mini manicure. I wasn't sure if I would be able to since I had shellac nail polish on my hands and I know it is a pain to remove...but they said no problem and just had me soak my nails for 10 minutes. Thank you! 

I look forward to coming back for a mani/pedi or a massage!",5
Local Flavor,"I did it! After 25 long, tense years...I got my first ever massage! And it was fantastic!! I'm going to be one of those people who leaves work early to get massages now.  A very big thanks to Rachel, the new masseuse at Mood Swings, who was gentle with me during my first time. 

Without Yelp's fantastic spa night - I would have never experienced such magical bliss! I also have to mention how attentive and friendly Mood Swing's general manager is! A big thanks to him as well!  

I had a lovely time meeting other Yelpers in this intimate setting and getting know them as more than a thumbnail pic and a name! There were manicures, facials, aromatherapy, makeup lessons, there were also appetizers and champagne and goodie bags for everyone! 

I am already a huge Aveda fan, but have never used their makeup so it was nice getting familiar with that and being able to take home  a full size lip gloss!",5
Local Flavor,"Last week, I was one of the lucky few got invited to Yelp's Spa Night.  Thanks to Lindsey for inviting me!   Unfortunately, the a/c wasn't working but everyone was in their happy mood.  I had a great time chatting with other Yelpers.  

Brandon, GM of Mood Swings and his team really treated us very very well!   Snacks, chair massage, hand massage, manicure, make-up lesson, and the goodie bag with Aveda products.  Oh yea, there was bubbly too!  

Thank you so much for a wonderful night of relaxation!",5
Local Flavor,"What a fun way to spend my Hump day! Thanks to Mood Swings for giving us a little taste of the salon and hosting all of us crazy yelpers. I really enjoyed learning about the product and am looking to going back in a couple weeks for a facial.  

Oh, and best goodie bag of the year, Free Aveda products? Yes, Please!",5
Local Flavor,"This was one of my fave Yelp events so far!

I enjoyed getting to know a few more lady Yelpers while sampling some of Mood Swings great services.

Much thanks to Cecilia for my mani and advice about what base coat to use for a DIY mani!

An even bigger thanks to Lindsey and Brandon for putting this together. So much fun!",5
Local Flavor,I have always wanted to try Mood Swings and thanks to Yelp I did!  I didn't know they provided so many services and the prices are so reasonable.  I loved the mini salon services that were provided.  I can't wait to book an appointment for a facial!  Thanks for the amazing goodie bag!!!,5
Local Flavor,"10 years ago I came to this place as a high school student ready to have an amazing haircut. I figured I would throw forth a few extra dollars to have an experienced individual cut my hair in hopes of attracting whatever girl I may have been trying to impress at that time. When I got home from that haircut my dad proceeded to make fun of my new do because apparently they did not cut the back. In all honesty, I had left the place with a mullet. It was my fault for not looking at the back before leaving, but then again - I didn't expect to have the back of my head barely touched. Anyways, I ended up going back to this place like an hour later and having them re-do the back which they obliged. I was also informed I had been the first individual to ever leave and come back to have my hair re-cut. It was a traumatic experience for both parties and I never stepped foot into Mood Swings until Yelp's Spa Night...

The event was fun, the staff was welcoming, and lots of yelpers were mingling. It seemed liked there were a lot of yelpers present - maybe more then they were expecting? We arrived 30 minutes after the scheduled time and we waited for a little over an hour before we got to sample the services. Even though the wait time was unexpected - they were very customer centered and offered my girlfriend a free manicure at a later time since they were not able to accommodate her. The massage service I received was very nice. I forget the name of the masseuse but there is only one and she seemed knowledgeable about her craft.  I am seriously contemplating coming back just to give the massage a try. They gave us some samples....the hand cream was pretty bomb. I wash my hands about 25 times a day and the cream really does keep my hands from drying out.

Will I be back for a haircut? I don't know. Only time will tell whether or not I feel daring enough. I'm pretty committed to Sports Clips ... yes, Sports Clips, but I may feel wild one day.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Over the summer, Summerhall was re-opened as a venue. It was quiet quiet about it, I didn't even realise just how much is going on at Summerhall. Gigs, fashion shows, there's a kitchen, I think they even have their own beer? I've not explored it fully yet, have actually only been to one show here, but I think I need to go - and soon - to see more of it and update my review.

I was here for the Mediterraneo show on a Saturday night. It was in a large hall up the stairs. It's a gorgeous building, huge stair case, really tall ceilings. I believe it was previously used for University lectures? 

The show itself perhaps didn't suit the venue very well. Or perhaps the venue itself needs a particular type of event. It felt a bit like a school disco - the very tall ceilings and one large open room with make-shift stage made it feel very airy and spacey. It got quite full by midnight but still not packed. I know we often complain clubs are too packed, but this just felt a bit stilted. The bar was also in another room and they ran out of water. Hmmm. There was also only one toilet for everyone to use. Long queue, not happy punters.

I've heard the dissection room is amazing, on different levels, an interesting shape and makes an interesting venue. I do want to go back and see it again in different forms. Perhaps as the club night was new and it wasn't really full made it feel a bit emptier. It is a stunning venue, just an odd choice for 'club' or gig nights.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I should be giving Summerhall five stars but there's so much of the place that I haven't seen, so I've opted to leave myself some room to grow when I come back to update this review in the future. A warren of gallery spaces, workshops, dissection rooms, events spaces and corridors make for a unique venue. Edinburgh is hopefully a city able to take advantage of the possibilities that this opens up: a space for every event, and in time I'm sure every event will find its way through these spaces.

There's also a very smart bar right at the heart of the venue, with an eclectic array of wall decorations - much of it veterinary, some of it anthropological in origin. During the summer months, and presumably also at times of inclement weather, there are performances and drinks to be had in the central courtyard, some of it from the on-site brewery. Is there anything this place lacks? Well, I shall go looking on repeat visits and report back.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Gorgeous. Lovely. Potentially creepy and kind of brilliant.

The Summerhall was once a veterinary school, then it sat, empty and unloved, until a madman with more money than sense bought it and gave it over to artists.

Artists who might, for instance, install a beam in a room covered in petroleum jelly.

This sort of thing happened in the late 50s, 60s, and 70s. Possibly even inthe 80s, but by then things were privatised and all sold off.

Events happen here. And there's a café with odd and cheap food and drink. 

It's a Good Thing for Edinburgh. And it appears to be getting better. Pop in and wander through.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I've only been to Summerhall for swing dancing events, held in the main hall upstairs, but it seems perfectly okay. It's an attractive venue, and being the old Dick Vet school there's a microscope in the bar and a room called the Dissection Room. The downside would be the toilets, which seem few and far between (and unisex). The two upstairs were clean, but there's only two which can result in a queue. Plus the hot taps didn't work. I don't even mean it wasn't hot water, they just didn't work. But apart from the loos it's really okay, and I imagine I'll be back for non-swinging events come August.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"This is one of those places where events happen all the time but not very many people know about it. It's a well kept secret. 

I've been to gigs, comedy, charity do's and quirky secret society events here and I've never been disappointed with the place.

There's a bar called the Royal Dick to satisfy even the thirstiest camel and a cafe serving coffee and the usual snackage if you're not in the mood for the hard stuff.

My advice - drop by and pick up a programme and keep an eye out for Fringe events that aren't in the main programme. You may very well be pleasantly surprised!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Being the old veterinary school, it reaps of history but some may be screamish to what hapened here.

Now it houses small firms, exhibitions, events and Barney's Beer with it's new lease of life.

I like the original part of the building, I'm not too sure by the added parts that were built in the sixties are the look ugly.

A good place to catch a beer is just at the old schools pub which is located at the back of the main foyer.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"What a great venue! We wandered over from the Meadows park, which is pretty close if you're walking. The building itself is very grand, quite beautiful. I can see how it can be quite easy to get lost inside. It's huge! We went for a fringe art exhibit which had been going on for almost 2 months. 

The exhibit itself was very interesting and some of the pieces of art were absolutely amazing! We found it quite fun to explore the different levels of the grand building. It almost seemed like we were on a treasure hunt, never knowing what we might stumble upon! The rooms are huge and the main hall is really large and fabulous. The back garden is  a very nice place to hang out on a nice day. There is plenty of seating and a table football available to play with! 

There is a wee cafe inside which was bustling with people and the smell of fresh backed cakes & coffee. Very inviting and warm. Excellent place for wee ones!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Summerhall is a great place to hold events. Being an old vetinary school, I've been to interactive plays (Zombies!) and talks here. Every Tuesday night, the Ceilidh club setup shop here. Outside of that, there are plays, other talks, events and yoga that run here. It's a great facility and highly worth a visit to check out what is on if you are in the area.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Not a bad place to see a band (& they're making the effort to bring in a good many of those) although the signage could be clearer so you're not wandering in to other events whilst trying to find the hall being used for the show.

We saw Eagulls play a week or so ago and the sound was pretty decent + there are a few sofas through by the toilets so you can lie around rather more comfortably than in most other venues in the city.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Stumbled in for a bit of theater during Fringe Fest. After hanging out in the courtyard and cafe, we decided to spend the rest of our festival hanging around. We saw great, experimental theater and loved the building and its culture.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I enjoy watching F1 and I've been to at least 6 races.  After getting off the metro station, we had to take a long hike to get to our seats at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.  They could have opened other gates  instead of going around through one entrance.  We had VIP tickets and you would think we'd have a special entrance but no!  There are no decent bathrooms.  You have to use portalets which were totally disgusting.

Food was average.  The only good thing about CGV is the view of the Biosphere in Parc Jean-Drapeau.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Durant l'été, le circuit Gilles Villeneuve est un endroit formidable pour rouler en vélo ou en roller-blade. La quasi absence de trafic routier sur le site en fait un endroit très sécuritaire pour s'adonner à son sport préféré. À cause de son revêtement conçu expressément pour la course automobile, il s'agit de la route la mieux entretenue de Montréal. C'est aussi un bon endroit pour courir si l'on préfère les longs parcours plats. À vélo, l'endroit est accessible par la piste cyclable du pont de la Concorde via le vieux Montréal. Pour le roller-blade ou la course à pied, je vous suggère d'utiliser le métro ou le pont Jacques Cartier. 

Bien sûr, la semaine du grand-prix, le circuit fait place aux amateurs de F1. Il devient donc inaccessible aux cyclistes et autres promeneurs. L'endroit devient bondé de touristes internationaux attirés par l'atmosphère glamour du grand cirque de la F1. À ce moment, les prix de la restauration sur l'île frôlent le ridicule. Je conseil aux amateurs de course d'apporter un gouter, ce qui vous fera économiser beaucoup. Malgré cela, l'Île Notre-Dame reste la destination F1 la plus abordable au monde !

En conclusion, le CGV est à découvrir, surtout lorsque la F1 n'est pas de passage à Montréal. Vous découvrirez un endroit paisible, dans un milieu naturel et charmant. Le calme garanti.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Went here for the first time for the 2014 Montreal Grand Prix and I had an amazing 3 days on the Circuit.

During downtime between the GrandPrix sessions, there were lots of vendors selling F1 merchandise, food and offering free samples! I think my party and I gathered about $200+ worth of free samples that weekend. 

We sat at Grandstand 31 which was in the heart of it all. It has a beautiful view of the Montreal skyline on the right, the track in front and the Casino de Montreal on the left. You can tell we were newcomers as everyone had coolers with beers, ready-made food and snacks while we just had water bottles in our backpack. Forced to buy mediocre food to save money, we came ready the last two days!
Note to people coming to the Grand Prix for the first time, you can bring WHATEVER you want to eat and drink at the Grand Prix! Just as long as your cooler fits under your bench.

At the end of the races on the last day, the crowd got to walk on the circuit which was an amazing feeling! A lot of people started to run and take pictures where cars had crashed and even picked up debris as souvenirs. I walked a few metres down the track before leaving but I am kicking myself in the butt for not walking to where it says ""SALUT GILLES"" at the start. There will definitely be a next time!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"For F1 fans it's a dream come true to be able to actually enter the circuit for free and with total freedom to move around
It has a lane reserved for sports, mainly cycling but you can also run or go for a walk
There also a beach in the facilities and you can get there by bike easily trough an exclusive road for bikes",5
Arts & Entertainment,"first came here in 2011 and then again in 2015. The event organizers still maintain a great job at running the Grand Prix. Everything is labeled properly and big signage on where everything is.

I really only come here during race day (Sunday) i don't normally come during the Practice or Qualifying. I'm pretty busy partying at New City gas or heading to the block parties in Downtown MTL.

This past season (2015) I wish i stayed a little bit to walk the course and try to get a souvenir like the DRS sign or something like that but maybe I'll do that when I'm back in another 3-4 years.

Over all, this place is amazing and I will most definitely be back.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Je fais la critique pour le circuit pendant la F1. Quel beau moment pour  tous les Montrealais et les touristes. Même si nous ne sommes pas du tout fan de F1, je promets que vous allez vous amusez en y allant. Je vous conseille d'y aller samedi ou vendredi, car vous voyez differentes courses et vous pouvez vous  promener sur le site. Aussi, vous pouvez amener votre propre alcool et bouffe dans unr petite glacière. Ce qui est bien quand la bière coûte 8.25$ chaque. J'étais assi à la section Bronze 34. Cette section offre des sièges préétablie. Par contre, si le budget ne vous le permet pas, vous pouvez acheter des billets admission générale où vous avez le choix à des estrades où bien des endroits réservé où vous êtes debout. 

Je met 3*, car ils ont enlever la section Bud light, où on pouvait danser et boire notre alcool. Il y a maintenant une section Terrasse Heineken, qui est magnifique, mais où il est interdit de rentrer avec notre alcool... :( Aussi, il est maintenant interdit d'amener de grosses glacière comme les années précédentes. Il n'y a que des toilettes chimiques ou presque. Les agents de sécurités ne sont pas très au courant des emplacement du site.",3
Public Services & Government,"What can I say - When this Sky Train is complete, it will be very convenient for all moving around the airport! You will even be able to go to station at 44th St for the Light Rail!",5
Public Services & Government,"Let me just start by saying that the PHX Sky Train is amazing! It's fast, clean, efficient and economical. Trains run every 3-5 minutes so you never wait to long either. The ride is smooth, plenty of room for your luggage, and the two biggest stations are air conditioned so your not drenched in sweat when you go to meet your in-laws waiting to pick you up in July! 

As of right now, being so new and all, the Sky Train or 44th Street Station rather, is a hidden jem!  This station located right at the corner of 44th St & Washington is huge, three levels with lots of waiting space. While great for light rail riders as it has an air conditioned bridge to the Metro stop, it is also built to be used as local passenger pick up and drop off. Neat,  right?!  It is built with the same style curbs as terminal 4 or 3 but without the hassle of driving into the airport. This makes it much easier to get family or friends flying through Sky Harbor with less traffic and closer to freeways 202 and 143! This station even has a Cell Phone lot just like the ones at the terminals and these actually include some metered parking so you can leave the car behind up to 4 hours and ride into the airport with your friends, super cool.

 The first floor has LOTS of waiting space, inside and outside covered. Second floor has bridge to Metro Light Rail with bag check for select airlines and third floor is the actual station platform for the Sky Train. 

 I urge anyone to skip the drive to the airport and use this whether you're riding in yourself or picking someone up. It's so futuristic and a great addition to our fine city. My buddy even said ""I feel like I'm in Tron"", can't complain with that! Great asset to Phoenix, you will love this service, really! Future extentions include to Terminal 3 in 2015 and to the Rental Car Center in 2024.",5
Public Services & Government,"Nice, shiny, new!  Already starting to get popular, the cars at times are full!  Time to add the third or middle car instead of running it in pairs.  

A couple of things that really bother me about this train.  It's the first train system I've seen that does not have posted instructions of where to go in an emergency.  

Usually on a Light rail or Subway type of train, they have banners posted on how to open the door and where to go depending on the type of track the train is on.
What do you do if there's a fire?  What do you do if the train looses power and stops?  In the heat? There is absolutely nothing to inform you of this at PHX. The SkyLink at DFW has stairways to get off of the elevated track bed, PHX does not. DFW has the same brand and model of train, Bombardier.  

The T-4 station faces the Southwest Airlines ramp on the south of the terminal.  During Southwest's busy times, the station smells like exhaust.  Probably not a problem if you're in the station a short time, but there are people that work right there.  They have station monitors to help newbies, they are sitting there and watching or mingling with travelers that need direction, for hours at at time. And you have the janitorial people there keeping that expensive floor clean.",2
Public Services & Government,"Best service to hit the Valley since I have been around. Luggage drop-off one hour before departure is convenient if you're traveling with Southwest or USAir. If you a boarding pass, go right to the gate. Please consider a departure board at the arrival platform so travelers can confirm gates and times.",5
Public Services & Government,"So now that we have the light rail, decent restaurants in our airport and a train in the sky, it's like Phoenix is a real city. I can't begin to describe how much easier travel is with the Sky Train. I've never waited more than 5 minutes for a train and if I get there early enough I can even pre-check my bags. The issue is, I'm never there early enough, even if I'm there 90 minutes before as it states. The station is clean, the walkways are awesome and it drops you off right near all the concourses at terminal 4. I never thought the shuttle was much of a pain, but man, this is so much more efficient. It's about time I actually look forward to heading to the airport.",5
Public Services & Government,"The sky train is fantastic. Almost hard to believe this is Phoenix and someone got it right.  But then there's news that when terminal 3 is connected they will be spending money to build a walkway to terminal 2.

A walkway really? Hope it's a short walk at least, but aside from that, what about the West economy parking and the rental car facility?  

I know it's not even in the budget right now, but they aren't even discussing it as part of the plan to make the airport truly connected the way it should be.  One would hope theres a plan for this. 

Otherwise, one poster brings to light a safety concern. Power outage.  What's the plan for fire escape, and trapped passengers in the summer heat? 

But otherwise I've used the train twice, one for US Air and the bag check is great along with the location in terminal 4 at the gate level, and then once for Delta, term 3.

Transferring to a bus wasn't the greatest, but the signage of where the terminal bus vs. rental car bus waiting areas are not clear. Lots of people including flight crews asking where the correct bus stop is. I answered, I thought you knew so I was following you LOL",4
Public Services & Government,Incredibly efficient way to save $16/day on parking compared to the close lot.  This airport gets better and better.,4
Public Services & Government,"Pretty awesome. You can park in the east economy lot and take this over to terminal 4. It makes the whole process of parking at the airport incredibley easy. The trains come every few minutes, so you're never waiting long. The trains themselves are really clean.

They also have a thing where you can check your bags before you even get on the train, we didn't use it but it seems like a great feature!",4
Public Services & Government,"First time on this train and it was great! We were able to bus, light rail and train so that we didn't have to take a shuttle, taxi or pay for parking. The train was nice, quick and easy to navigate. The only thing to remember is that it drops you off on the 3rd floor so you have to go downstairs to check your bag! Me and my husband were a little lost at first not realizing we were on the 3rd floor =)",4
Public Services & Government,"The more I use this train, the more I like it.  

Will be great when they connect the other two terminals! Hopefully sooner than planned. 

In regards to the emergency exits, I did notice the walkway in between the tracks and the emergency latch to get out in case of fire or power failure. 

Again nice job!

However: Flight monitors in the train station.   I know one issue is for T4,  you don't always know your gate ahead of time, so your not knowing which way you need to exit the walkway out of the train platform. It's a bit of a walk to one of the checkpoints just to find out your gate in in the opposite direction.",4
Public Services & Government,"We didn't like it, and here's why:

We parked in the covered garage at the East Economy Lot.  
There was no signage pointing to the Phx Sky Train from inside the Parking Garage.  
Found the sinage when up the SLOOOWWW esclator to the deck to catch the train.
The train only takes you to Terminal 4. Lasted about 3 minutes.
You then have to walk down a long corridor that takes you insideTerminal 4.
Very little sinage at the end of this corridor - we asked a stewardess and she pointed us to the elevators.
Get on the elevators down one level and out of the terminal to the curb to catch the Airport Shuttle Bus - make sure you are on the correct side - this is what I hate about the Phoenix Airport.
Take the Airport Shuttle Bus to your Terminal 2 or 3.

This took us about 20-30 minutes.  Another group was just as lost as we were and just as frustrated.  

Why in God's creation would I pay EXTRA DOLLARS ($11/day covered parking) to park at the Airport to go through all this when I could pay less at some off airport shuttle/parking company and be dropped off right at the curb for the airport Terminal that I'm flying out of.  

Sorry Phoenix Sky Harbor - maybe after you spend another $240 million to extend this train to ALL terminals will it be worth my while.",1
Public Services & Government,Way too many steps now in the parking process at east economy. Drive in park...walk to shuttle stop area....wait.......catch open air shuttle to train...train ride ....(cool)....home....down to baggage....back up to train.....train to open air shuttle...somewhere near car.....more expensive than off-airport parking....all that for one billion dollars....,2
Public Services & Government,"This is it! 

This is the best fucking tram, free or otherwise, in the goddamn country! 

This puts the Las Vegas strip trams, the ones built and operated by MGM Resorts Intl., and, that other useless one built on the East end (Monorail) that is bleeding arterial red like crazy, to absolute shame. 

The future has arrived motherfuckers! 

And it is in scary-conservative Maricopa County, U.S.A. ....

Make this bitch traverse the whole damn dame metropolis and we would all be heroes. 

That is all. - E",5
Public Services & Government,Pretty cool ride but a little bumpy considering the age. Might be more fun during the day when you can see where you're going...,3
Public Services & Government,I travel a good bit for business and use the east economy lot. The sky train is great for a quick transport to terminal 4. Seems to arrive the second I walk up every time. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't take you to any other terminals so leave yourself some time if your airline does not depart from terminal 4 because you have to take a shuttly to access any other terminals. Wait can be 10 minutes sometimes... plus the travel time to get there.,4
Public Services & Government,"This is a hidden gem and I shouldn't be spreading the word! Traveling with my wife and two kids on a Saturday, we used the curbside drop off at the 44th st and Washington station. There was not another traveler in sight. We headed up to the second floor to us the early bag check and again no one in line. Checked our bags, flying Southwest, and headed to the train. It arrived in less then a minute and we were in terminal 4 in 10 minutes. Seriously this is the only way to go if you are flying out of terminal 4.",5
Public Services & Government,"Well, I was lucky enough to ride on this the 2nd day it was up and running.
It is a good concept and it is free so you have nothing to complain about.
However for now it only goes to Terminal 4. You have to get off the train. Go down to level 2 ,take a bus over to Terminal 3 and 2. They are working on building more, so it will do that eventually.

It is quick and easy. One of the bad things is the homeless riders have no discovered it. They will get on it at 44th street and ride it over to the airport for a while and hang out ,then ride it back and forth.
So in the summer it can be probably a lot of fun for them. 
Just watch your bags and enjoy the ride.",4
Public Services & Government,Very impressive system.  Seamless transition from light rail to Sky Train - makes it easy to get to the airport using public transportation.  Highly recommended.,5
Public Services & Government,"I take this train almost weekly, and talk about punctual!  The driver is a machine, NEVER a minute late!",5
Public Services & Government,This is a great concept and works well if you're flying out of terminal 3 or 4. If you're flying out of 2 this is such a pain! The train does not have a terminal 2 stop but the shuttles will not take you to the east economy lot from T2 so you have to take a shuttle to terminal 4 then catch the train from there. Sounds easy unless you're dragging luggage up and down stairs like I was. Took me 45 min to get to my car after the plane landed. I'm hoping the phoenix city council is working to fix this problem. Use Blue Sky if you're using terminal 2. Way easier!,2
Public Services & Government,"This is not a train- it's a roller coaster! Seriously- is this thing safe? I don't see how we didn't fly off the rails last night it was going so damn fast, but I appreciated the speed cause I was tired and ready to go the hell home after my 5 hour flight from the east coast. It's like the Disney Monorail but it feels like it carries a higher personal injury factor.

With the rise in popularity of GPS based ride-share apps like Uber & Lyft, and the traditional cab companies trying hard to prevent pick ups and drop offs at the terminals, the Sky Train is the place to be picked up. 

Signage in & out of the Sky Train station could be more obvious and perhaps even lighted at night, and for a weekday evening when the airport terminals and baggage claim were packed, there was no one on the Sky Train taking it out to the Light Rail station. So it has that not busy or crowded thing going for it.",4
Public Services & Government,"Watch out here predatory ticket and towing!
My spouse parked at the cell phone lot at the sky tram on Easter Sunday. He walked up to the tram exit to meet me and help with my bags, in just the few minutes our truck was ticketed and going on the tow truck. Yes the sign said ""Do not leave your car unattended"" however, there were only two other cars in the whole lot and he just went up to the tram exit not more than two minutes' walk from the parking or standing lot. Really Sky Harbor is this the intention of the sky tram? If you don't want us to use it then fine we will go back to picking up passengers at the airport. Never again will I use the sky tram.",1
Public Services & Government,"Got to save my 85 year old father the stress of driving up to terminal 4 at Sky Harbor. As we drove South on 44th Street right before us lay the Sky Train terminal without another car in sight. The terminal is gorgeous! The train zipped me to the terminal reminiscent of a speedy Disneyland experience.
Dad was headed back home instead of the cardiac unit at the local hospital. Sky Train is great!",5
Public Services & Government,"I really dig the Phx Sky Train. It's like a roller coaster for people who are afraid of the real things (I'm not). The ride is very smooth, and completely automated, so you feel like you've landed in an episode of the Jetsons. Yeah, totally cool.",4
Public Services & Government,"Awesome ride for young kids. Who needs the Disney monorail when you have the Sky Train? We once visited the airport just to ride it. No problem convincing the grand kids to meet grandma at the airport anymore.

At a cost of well over a billion dollars, you have to wonder if there wasn't a more cost effective way to connect the three terminals and light rail. Put aside those thoughts. Enjoy the sparkly floors.",5
Public Services & Government,"What isn't to love about the sky train?! It's free, runs very consistently, and saves me the headache of having to park or Uber to the airport when I travel and take the light rail.

It really is the fastest way (for me) to get in and out of the airport quickly - I can't wait for the expansion to open (that is, if I'm ever not traveling out of terminal 4).

The only grief I have - that's not even worth deducting a star for because it's consistently my fault - is that I'm never able to use the baggage check available at the stop for the train. They have a 2 hour cutoff, and I'm consistently never early. Sigh....",5
Public Services & Government,Worst experience ever . Took 40 minutes to come it's false advertisement . Waste of time . Ghetto employees. Just disappointed .,1
Public Services & Government,"The Sky Train really works just fine, but our light rail just doesn't get me anywhere I'm trying to go.  It also makes you wait just a little past your natural sensitivity between trains, that seems to be fairly typical though across the country (caugh, Oakland).  I used Sky Train this time as I figured out that you can hop on the free train, then on the other end of the line, you just jump in an uber to get home.  This is a great way to get home from the airport, without risking getting an uber driver a $300 ticket by having them pick you up at the airport.  So, for everyone out there thinking about taking a taxi from the airport, go with this method instead.  It will probably cut your bill to get home in half, though, no guarantee.*",2
Public Services & Government,"The Sky Train is great, Sky Harbor is not a large airport anyway, so this allows you to park at the economy parking lot. I park at the east side parking lot about ten to fifteen times a year. Never had a problem with it, gets you to the terminal very quickly. They also have shuttles within the parking lot to take you to the tram. Very convenient! It is a little walk to get there from the baggage claim area, but no big deal.",5
Local Flavor,"Everything that's great, awkward and weird about Willy comes together in a people packed street fest that's pretty rad if you have the time and patience to navigate through some crunchy situations.",5
Local Flavor,"Just a mere half a block from my house, Willy Street Fair is something I will look forward to for years to come!

Two days of sheer shenanigans. Expect costumes, great music, beer, delicious local food, amazing local artists, and an all around good time. This event is the epitome of what makes Willy Street unique!",5
Local Flavor,"One word: Awesome.   The food vendors, shopping booths and bands encompassed the willy street culture!!!!",5
Local Flavor,"This fair is a blast. You will not find a better block party in Madison. Four stages with live music, great food and always something unexpected to delight and surprise you. The people-watching here is phenomenal.",5
Local Flavor,"Wow! What a great way to highlight some of the best places in Madison. 

Great food, free 5-minute massages (if you want to wait in line), sweet DJs playing on different stages to keep the atmosphere bumpin, shops are open if you want to stop in. 

This is a good way to get a feel for a bunch of places on Willy Street, one of my favorite streets in Madison.",4
Local Flavor,Highly enjoyable! Great way to get to know vendors in the area. Good music.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"Goretorium has to be the best haunted attractions I've ever been in.  The details are over the top and the gore is at it's highest.  This isn't one of those cheesy ""Halloween Time"" haunted houses that make you jump with shrieks of ""HELPPP ME!"" This is the real deal, with professional actors to enhance the experience. The back-story behind the Goretorium makes it that much better, and automatically makes you feel like you're a part of the experience. 

If you're a TRUE horror fan, love GORE and are looking to get the sh*t scared out of you for once, then I HIGHLY suggest visiting Goretorium.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"GORETORIUM is the best haunt you'll experience EVER!! The amount of time and effort going into this production will leave you shaking and amazed all at once! Being on the LV Strip, you're bound to have a great time full of scares and gore and more!! Send in your request for time off ASAP and get your tickets!! Be the first to see Eli Roth's GORETORIUM in action!!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I actually got to attend the pre pre-show party on the 26th, which was more commonly known as the event that was supposed to be two hours long, around 1,000 people showed up, and not many got in.  The fact that I did feels nothing short of a miracle.  From what I gathered, the Facebook invite got leaked, so they got way overbooked, and just couldn't handle the traffic flow.  So a lot of people didn't get in, and a lot of people (understandably) weren't happy.  How that's going to affect the initial impression remains to be seen.

Conceptually, this place is very clever.  Simply put: I like theme bars and restaurants.  I still mourn the demise of the Star Trek Experience as it was just great fun, and nothing really has replaced it.

Goretorium is a year-round haunted house attraction with a bar.  All those places that pop up this time of year with mazes and blood and people jumping out at you?  This is a 365 day a year version of that.

Being the pre-opening, and considering the awkward crowd control, I don't think the place was 100% operational, so it's hard to critique in some ways.  The downstairs bar wasn't open, and it's hard to say if the upstairs bar is accessible to the general public, or just a bonus for the end of the horror experience.

As far as costumes go, they have some GREAT ghouls.  Zombies, mad scientists, magicians, and even ""Bloody Mary"" was really cool.  I've worked a few horror gigs over the years, and I was trying to figure out some of the special effects.  I'd like to see how they interact with the crowd under a ""normal"" day.

The maze was well done.  Plenty of lead up, a couple of nice jumps, lots of blood and trickery.  My friend accidentally walked into a wrong door (I followed, naturally my luck), and it led into a cast holding area.  Oops.  But they held in character, and they teased when we went down the ""right"" path.  I won't spoil the haunt itself as that's half the fun, but the end of the experience leads hapless wanderers into an upper level bar area with a nice view of the Strip.  They even have a unisex bathroom, so if you walk in, and something doesn't seem right, it actually is.  Someone could have warned me, though.  I had that initial ""Oh, crap.  Wrong bathroom"" moment, and I couldn't even excuse the mishap on too much liquor.

There were a few things I'd make note of.  I think $40 is simply too high a price to charge for the attraction, especially with the economy still being so ""meh"" right now.  $30?  I could better see that.  Locals discounts?  I'd strongly consider that, otherwise they are going to have to cater exclusively to tourists because unless you love horror, and I mean LOVE horror, the experience is fun, but a one time deal.  Especially for the price.

The gift shop wasn't much to look at, either.  Not a varied or wide selection, though it looked like they were selling prop surgical tools.

It's unfortunate that Goretorium seemed to have such a rough first night, and hopefully the bad taste will leave people's mouths so they give the place a chance later when it gets some kinks worked out.  I stayed out of all the ""political"" aspects, and as a customer, I had fun with my group of friends.

Goretorium has potential, and I love wacky theme bars, but the prices shouldn't be the scariest thing there.",4
Arts & Entertainment,This place is a complete waste.  The ticket price is too much for what you get.  15 minutes guided through some cartoonish looking BS and then led out into an area where you can spend even more money on expensive drinks and a gift shop.,1
Arts & Entertainment,"I went to a private event held by Seven Magazine.  I had to RSVP for this event.  I RSVPD.  I waited in line for hours.. about 2.  There was a bagpiper outside the venue blaring his pipes.  When we finally got close enough to the door the front area was roped off and the bouncers were staring into the crowd.  The bouncers would not even tell us what if anything was going on.  They would not answer if the space was open, closed, or waiting for people to exit so we could get in.  When I emailed the Goritorium they said they would issue an announcement in a few days.  Since that time they have done everything in their power to silence voices like mine.  No statement was issued.  They will not admit people back in.  The event space seems like it is ran more like a nightclub than a haunted house attraction.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"While the makeup and effects are cool the 20 minute tour is light on scare considering the $43 ticket price.  The tour ends at what they call the ""Baby Doll Lounge"" which was really only a balcony and some tables.  I wouldnt recommend it Im sorry to say.  They could improve the scares with metering the people in smaller batches.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"This was truly a major-league disappointment.
I am a huge fan of the horror genre, and have a great respect for Eli Roth. I took a group of friends to the Goretorium, and I was very excited.
This is a classic example of a chain only being as strong as it's weakest link. I had the very highest of hopes, and even gave an extra star based on the money someone clearly poured into this venture. But sadly, it was all soured by the customer service. Yes, the weakest link was the staff. And they were so flippant, and so sarcastically sweet in the way they went about trivializing our experience, that I felt compelled to write this review. It's really too bad, because behind the staff that is ultimately going to be their costly demise, I'm sure there is a well intentioned group of visionaries that will always wonder what happened to their brilliant and well executed idea. Unfortunately, Las Vegas is a customer service driven destination, and to survive here, they are going to need to learn that, quickly. Hopefully, they read these reviews, and learn from them.
As such, it is with a heavy heart that I issue 2 stars.
I do however hope that they get their act together, since this has the potential of being a great addition to Las Vegas. 
I will try them again in a month or so, and re-review.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"This is the sickest, most twisted thing I've ever seen.  I loved it.  Not for the faint of heart.  Puts all other haunted attractions to shame.  Be sure to hang out at the baby doll lounge afterwards.  Good drinks and great view of the strip.  Manson and Eli Roth were there the night we went.  Very cool!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I am going to write a very detailed review of this situation, because I have mixed feelings about this attraction. Please bear with me, this may get long.

I am a Texas native and a big fan of Eli Roth, so when I heard about the Goretorium I freaked out and immediately planned a trip to Vegas. I took a horror-loving friend with me and we arrived on October 7; it was their second weekend open to the public.

The place is difficult to find, you have to enter a shopping center and go to the upstairs level. Once there, however, the decor is stunning; they've paid a ton of attention to detail and there are surgical instruments, torture devices, prosthetic limbs and more on display as well as gory artwork. You're greeted by The Wall, a huge man standing nearly 7 feet tall who is happy to pose for photos and chat with you about the attraction. The bar, Bloody Mary's, is the first thing you see upon entering; a small, narrow affair, above the bartenders a beautiful woman's torso is displayed before trailing off into plastic tubes. She 'bleeds' Bloody Mary mix while bantering with the audience, and it's a visual delight to see her. However, the drinks are extremely expensive and we were told by one bartender that the gratuity for staff is already added in so he warned us not to tip. The drinks are approximately $15 a cocktail or $20 for a collectors' cup full of the drink of your choice. 

We had opted for VIP tickets thinking there'd be a big line, but when we got there at 8:30 PM it was a ghost town. We handed our tickets to a staff member and were told to walk around while waiting for our turn. We were finally summoned about ten minutes later and we rode in a red-lit elevator up to the floor where the party begins. A man dressed as a ghoulish concierge gave us a brief history of the attraction (it's themed around a hotel called The Delmont where many people were brutally murdered) and then sent us into the elevator to begin the experience.

The haunt itself is nearly perfect. Exquisite details, performers, makeup and design, and all of the jump scares you'd expect from any of the big haunted houses. There is beautiful work in every room and some genuinely freaky moments; don't rush through it, you'll regret not taking time to savor the work put into the attraction.

However, it was when we finished that we began to have problems. For one, VIP is supposed to include free admission to the Baby Dolls lounge; this night, no one was paying a cover, so this perk was rendered moot. The 'zombie strippers' we were promised were bored scantily-clad girls with minimal gore makeup on, all of them standing around talking. Two big flat-screens played ""Hostel"" on loop but the music selection was excellent and the view of the strip was wonderful. My friend and I had a drink of a very sticky cocktail called Eli Roth's Blood and then headed back down to buy souvenirs. Here come the problems:

- VIP are supposed to get one free drink ticket each. Even after we handed our VIP passes to the staff, no one knew this/informed us of this, and we had to get a manager involved. He had to go into his office to retrieve the tickets for us. If we hadn't known to ask we wouldn't have received them (this is a $15 value per person, remember!)

- If you go VIP, you don't get the full experience: General Admission ticket-holders get to stand in a separate little foyer watching an exclusive movie that outlines the backstory of the Delmont Hotel, and they get treated to a great professional photo-opportunity. VIP members are rushed into the elevator and don't get the souvenir photo op or to view the special video. We requested to take a photo and the girl had to ask her manager if it was okay; they then acted put-out that we wanted a keepsake picture and escorted us to the photo op and back to make sure we didn't try to sneak through the haunt again.

- Nothing in the gift shop is priced. There are no price tags or signs on ANYTHING and we had to call a girl over every time we had a question. She was very friendly but it got annoying quickly. The shot glasses have an awful, rushed design and one of the t-shirts looks like they bought a Hot Topic shirt wholesale and then hastily screened a design on it; the 'Goretorium' red ink didn't even match the red on the rest of the design, it looked cheap and tacky. They were out of anything higher than an XL in all of the shirt designs, which made it impossible for me to buy souvenirs for several friends back in Texas. The girl informed me that all of the torture instruments on display were for sale ""but we have no idea how much they cost"" so she couldn't sell me one. She said they'd received a book outlining the prices but no one could figure out which tool was which so they hadn't 'bothered' with it yet.

Lots of kinks to work out from the business/treating their VIP right side of things but overall a great haunted house. And our bartender, an Islander guy, ROCKED.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"First off it was hard to find. It's in front of Planet Hollywood and you can see the balcony of the upstairs bar from LV Blvd. but it was puzzling how to get to the main attraction from the street, you have to go up an escalator from the outside and then walk inside of like this souvenir mall. very strange. But once you see it you get excited. They have scary guys and zombie chicks walking around scaring people. 

There's Bloody Mary's bar which had tasty drinks, overpriced, but what do you expect at a Vegas attraction BUT the one thing that reeeeeeally pissed me off is the $5 added tip! WTF?! I thought tipping was optional. Tipping is meant for someone doing a good job and earned it, not for a girl taking bottle caps off of 2 Bud bottles. ABSOLUTELY ridiculous.

I honestly don't know how much the actual attraction costs, I got to go for free because my boyfriend's work gave them tickets, but from reading other people's reviews i cannot believe spending that much money to walk through a scary maze for 15 minutes.  I will say that I did enjoy it, it was fun, I got scared. It was more than just people popping out scaring you, there were actual murdering scenes and gross things going on, there seemed to be some interactive areas too.  I wish I had taken more time in each room to really appreciate more of it.  

The maze exits to the upstairs bar which had a $10 cover, AGAIN: RIDICULOUS but our friends wanted to sit out there so we did. They were replaying Hostel over and over again, which was cool i guess but the music out there... UGH! horrible trance/dubstep remixes.. WTF?! play some scary music or something that relates to horror or at least some metal. really? Did Eli approve this? headache. 

When you leave the bar you walk back downstairs to the merch area which was decorated really cool and gory. I liked all the merch except there were no prices on anything.  They should fix that. I think people hate to have to ask how much everything is.

Overall, pretty cool if you're willing to spend the cash or if you're just a big Eli fan.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I had decided to take my husband to the Goretorium for an early birthday present and had seen on their website that there was a discount for purchasing tickets online, so I had done just that a day or so prior to actually going.  Upon arriving, there was absolutely no line so we walked right up and was lead up the stairs almost immediately (we decided to purchase just the regular tickets).  We had to wait maybe 2-3 minutes at the entrance for another group or two to show up, but that allowed us to get our photo taken, as well as look at the animated images, which were pretty cool.  Once one more group had shown up, we were allowed inside.  I will admit, while I wasn't terrified out of my mind I did thoroughly enjoy myself.  To be honest, though, I feel not being so scared allowed me to view everything that was in the maze a bit more and I ended up enjoying just the scenery of all of the little details that went into it.  There were a few things that were scary, as well, don't let my comment fool you, and I liked that it wasn't a typical jump out and scare haunted attraction.  The fact that things were already occurring when we would walk into a room was such a great way to go about it.  Anyone can jump out and scare someone, but I felt the way this was done made it all that more creepy.  When I exited I was very pleased with my experience.  The bathroom at the exit was hilarious and, upon exiting, there is a noise like a camera taking a picture and a voice says 'Smile for the camera!', not to mention the mirror is almost completely covered in blood!
After we had exited the maze, my husband and I spend quite a lengthy bit of time in the gift shop, just viewing all of the crazy items in there.  Again, those little details (bloody hand print on a tv, Eli Roth's decapitated head in a box) really made the experience extremely enjoyable.
While my husband and I were waiting to purchase our photo from the evening, we were approached by a man asking how it was inside.  Assuming it was someone wanting to go in (we had been approached by a man and his son earlier), we told him how much we enjoyed it, that it was scary but fun as well, explaining the main parts that we really enjoyed.
He then informed us that he was one of the guys that had built the place (Josh was his name) and he was extremely friendly.  He directed us over to the main waiting area again and told us to watch above Bloody Mary's bar to see the show.
Even after that fact, as we went back to pick up our picture from the evening, the woman at the counter was very sweet.  Since we had purchased our tickets online, they weren't as amazing looking as the ones you get upon purchasing them at the ticket booth, so we asked if we'd be able to get ones as souvenirs and she had those ready for us, as well!  This particular visit was the Saturday of opening weekend. Seeing all of the craziness that had occurred with some other people, I found it hard to believe that so much had gone wrong because our experience was great.
Even before knowing there was a locals discount, we had every intention of going back again and again, after being told there was an annual pass!  Everyone had been very friendly to us and the overall experience was astounding.  Even after the maze we hung around and watched the crowds grow and they seemed to handle it fairly well.
We had decided to go back again just this last Tuesday in an effort to get my sister-in-law to go.  Since we couldn't convince her, we decided to sit in the lobby area and allow her to experience all of the scary creatures walking around and have her try one of their drinks (we don't drink so we forced her to!).  She really loved the drink but said it was a bit pricey ($18 for a cup that wasn't very large at all).  Also, while I do love what they did with the Bloody Mary's bar, one thing I think they could work on is how frequently Bloody Mary comes out.  Both times we were there, it took quite a bit of time for her to arrive.  The plus side to waiting so long is that there is so much to look at while you wait.  The real fun is watching people come in and mess with the coffin full of body parts.  Be careful because the lid always falls down and terrifies everyone!  :)
We also had spoken with another member of the staff (could have been another owner as he was dressed pretty professional but we didn't get his name) and he had also told us since we had gone the time before that Eli Roth himself had gone through and changed a bunch of things so it's a completely different experience than the first time.
All in all, though, both times myself and my husband had great fun.  The small amount of issues that there were weren't at all enough to stop me from going back again and again.  The staff especially have been amazing.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"This is the type of thing you go to once just to say you did it.

My boyfriend being a huge Eli Roth fan and I loving haunted houses in general meant we had to go.

The tickets were $43.50 each for general admission. However, if you are a local you get $15 off per person, which left us paying $57 for the both of us.

WARNING: They make you go in groups of 7, so come with a group. Or be prepared to get stuck with some randoms. We were stuck with a group of drunk people, who kind of ruined our experience.

As everyone else said, the attention to detail was amazing. I can't believe people are saying they didn't get scared, it definitely scared us. Make sure you look at everything in each room. Everything is done so well. I had a hard time telling what was real and what was fake.

Would I return? If they changed up the haunted house, though that probably defeats the purpose. $57 for 15 minutes is pricey. And that's with the discount! We didn't bother going to the bar, after hearing about a cover fee and an $18/drink fee. No thanks. I guess this is geared more for tourists. We had a good time though. Worth checking it out at least once.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I am a huge horror fan and Goretorium was amazing! Real scares and shocks at every turn. Sets were perfect, looked scarily real. The effects leave one wondering ""how did they do that""? The actors were all professionals at the top of their game. The staff before and after the event were all extremely friendly and seemed wholly enthused about the project. Definitely a must for any horror fan who is willing to just have a good time. I'm so happy that Vegas is coming up with this sort of attraction for those of us who are interested in more than gambling, clubbing, and showgirls. I genuinely hope Goretorium is a successful Vegas attraction for a long, long time to come.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"This is an update to my previous review.....
We went again last night, as sort of a ""second chance"". The first time we went, we never made it into the attraction because they were ""closed due to technical difficulties"". That was all well and good, but we were a little upset because the website didn't say that, so we made the trip. And management was so flippant, rude, and uncaring about the whole situation, that I gave it a two star review for poor customer service, but vowed to return and re-review once they had worked the kinks out.
So, last night, we went back. 
First-off, the staff was much friendlier this time, which was nice to see. And we did get to experience the attraction this time, which I was extremely excited about, being a huge fan of the genre.
The reason I was so excited, was because the trailer that was released, pre-opening, was so amazing, that I honestly thought that this was going to be a different experience than a standard ""haunted house"" attraction. The barbershop scene was so realistic in that trailer, that this was on my must-do list.
Here's the rub......
The trailer had absolutely nothing to do with what was actually inside the attraction. And while the walk-through was decent, it had none of the production values of the trailer, so it felt a lot like a bait and switch. It was all your standard rubber body parts and props, the usual air, water, and loud noise scares, and actors working in and out of the sets doing their best to add realism.
It wasn't a bad haunt by any means, and it probably would have warranted an extra star, if it wasn't for the price. 
But the $40 price tag, is what is causing me to keep it at 2 stars, because it just wasn't worth the money. At $15, this would have been a 4 star review, maybe better. But for that price, and with the misleadingly amazing production value of the trailer, I truly expected a lot more. And unless they update it periodically, once you've seen it, there isn't any reason to go a second time.
Baby Dolls Lounge had a lovely view, but it was 59 degrees last night, and there were no space heaters, making it too cold to stay too long.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I was stoked to go to the Goretorium.  It was $25 for locals so I brought my bf...  Nothing was scary, all was very corny and cheap.  I expected to get scared at least ONCE.  

To top off a waste of money the security guards mistaked my bf for someone who apparently assaulted one of the workers and they manhandled him, cuffed him and left 3 large rug burns on his face along w sore shoulders to be let go after 10 minutes without an apology or reason for anything.  

I will do my best to turn people away from this place because of my experience.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but who wouldn't expect movie-quality special effects from ""Hostel"" guru Eli Roth. Unfortunately, it wasn't the ""pee you pants"" experience they advertise. It was rather, well, ho-hum., been-there, seen-that.

Now they spared no expense. The plot and elevator entrance is unique and the wedding chapel and feast stunts were well done. Only they seem to want to show it all off because the lighting was too bright killing some of the suspense.In addition, the actors were lackluster and there was little that was new and inventive. Most bits you can find at other haunted houses in town (only cheaper). These were more elaborate sure but that doesn't mean scarier.

In the end, your more likey to smile and laugh then shriek in terror. The terrifying part: It cost $40!! If you feel compelled to give it a shot, buy online, it's $35.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"It's a novelty and it's a fun one, but the wait was ridiculous. One of the staff members told me they had let a handful of people head home and were majorly understaffed as a result. We waited about an hour and a half to go through a maze that lasted about 15 minutes max. When you exit the maze you end up at the Baby Doll Lounge where the drinks are crazy expensive and the music is tragic. The view from the balcony bar  however is great.   It's fun in a touristy kind of way and it helped that we were in the All Hallow's Eve spirit, but I've been to better haunted houses that weren't so exorbitantly overpriced. For drinks and the maze we spent a boatload and that's with the locals discounts. Bummer.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Consider me jaded, but if the Goretorium's goal is to become THE adult haunted house in the nation, they've got a long road ahead.

First of all, the place is pretty damn expensive for a 15 minute Vegas attraction, definitely moreso than haunted houses in general. They say it is an ""experience"" and that you can take your time to truly enjoy the haunt. That's bullshit, considering every single set piece actor basically tells you to go ahead after their done with their act.

It seems the Goretorium wants to attract based on a pedigree of violence. The problem is haunted houses have been springing up all over the country based on the same premise; most notably Chambers of Horror in Atlanta, GA. If the Goretorium came around during the height of Roth's popularity, circa 2005, this would have been a new experience. Instead it's just another name on the list of ""adult"" haunts.

What really disappointed me was that I assumed this would be an amazing experience. Everything on Vegas is blown to larger-than-life proportion, so I naturally assumed a brand new haunted house in Vegas done by a recognized genre director would really set the pace.

It didn't.

I really don't want to spoil things, but there are a TON of just lazy special effects and poorly thought-out set pieces. I'll give a few pretty obvious examples.

- In the very beginning of the haunt, there are two elevator shafts they tell you to avoid. Two big problems here: the illusion of an actual elevator shaft is easily discernible by wear around the edge of the mirror that is set into the wall. You basically see the border of the trick, so to speak. In addition, there is a light elevated about 10 feet into the shaft. It perfectly reflects 10 feet below the shaft. When trying to trick someone, you draw attention AWAY from the product causing the illusion, not TO it. This should be really dark, dark enough for you to casually look and think it is a real elevator shaft you might fall down,

- There are two set pieces where a bride gets her armed ripped off and a woman gets her head ripped off. The problem is they just sort of pull and off it goes. There isn't any force behind it. It's just lazy. On top of that, the bride has a slight mist of water that sprays out from literally the opposite direction she's standing at. Why would I get sprayed from the left from an action that happened to my right?

- There is a fairly cool set piece right afterwards of a zombie attack of the dinner party. There are all these cool gory dinner meals that have maggots on them. The maggots are a light filter above. There is no sense of dimension obviously.

- There is what I can only describe as a ""tunnel of guts"". Netherworld and tons of other haunted houses have the same thing, a spinning tunnel that is meant to make you nauseous  by creating an optical illusion in the tunnel that messes with your depth perception. In addition, they usually mechanically shake the bridge to make it worse. There is no optical illusion with this that I can tell, just a spinning wall of meat you walk through on a fixed bridge.

- There is a reliance on LCD screens for WAY too many things, from the ticket line to the exit. The act that occurs in the elevator is totally ruined by the all-too-obvious glow of LCDs. I can only describe it as that awkward feeling when you see bad CG in a movie.

Now, on a positive note, the exit is actually pretty cool. I can only describe it as you being birthed to the exit which leads to an overpriced bar and a cool wall of severed baby heads on saws..

Frankly the best part was an awesome white t-shirt with a bloody stain around the neck. You can buy that online. If you're a real horror fanatic like I am, maybe if you have nothing better to do you can see it once just to say you did it. Otherwise, save your money.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I absolutely loved this place. I wasn't a huge fan of Eli Roth going into it so I wasn't expecting anything crazy (although there was a girl decked out in Eli Roth fan gear....stage 5 clinger for sure!). I'm a huge haunted attraction enthusiast so I did have a high expectation of being scared out of my wits and Goretorium delivered!  They had actors in costume roaming the hallway outside of the entrance as well as a bar that was open.  Just watching grown men get the crap scared out of them made the wait totally worth it.  We only waited about a half hour to get into the haunt but it went by fast.  I won't post spoilers of the haunted house but it was VERY well put together. It was very professionally done with great special effects. Goretorium has by far the best make up artists working for them. The actors looked so realistic that it was scary (seriously....this one guy looked like he spooned out his eyeball...NO idea how they did it). 

My friends and I are already planning to go back on Halloween. Rumor is Eli Roth will be one of the actors in the haunt and my friend is a huge fan. Should be interesting! I can't wait to go back!

P.S. Be sure to check in on facebook and visit the Baby Dolls Lounge...you get a free drink! Cheers Yelpers!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I have to say I was impressed with both the production value and the dedication of the cast paid to make you crap your pants. 

Its hard to write a review without spoiling the secrets so I won't give specifics on the rooms but trust me Ive been to a lot of these haunts and this one is done right.  The best thing I could say about it is it even made me jump once. 

My GF wouldnt go through with me so I took her 15yr old daughter who grabbed the back of my shirt and screamed till her voice went out.  My friend works there and said it might take a half hour to get through all the rooms but it all depends on how fast you walk. I was being pushed by her and we made it through in under 20 mins. 

Cost is a little high for some people but trust me it is worth every penny.

Oh it doesnt open till 7pm but the gift shop is always open its free of charge and has alot of cool props in it. Make sure to get a photo in the electric chair...its truely shocking!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"It was decent enough. I think for the money there are better ones out there. We did VIP which was nice to skip the line. Make sure you ask for your drink tickets for baby doll lounge so ya feel like you get something back. The lounge was pretty small but a good view of the strip. I'd just use your tickets and get out unless paying $15 or more for a drink is your thing. The make up and acting were good, good storyline. I think it will get better over time.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I went here with my boyfriend on the night of the Zombie walk as we had planned to go after our Zombie trek from Luxor. We lucked out and went on the night of the Zombie walk all dressed up so drinks at the two bars here were only $5 each. I had one Tequila sunrise at the bar downstairs before going into the Goretorium and later two upstairs at baby dolls lounge after. 

The adventure through the Goretorium is fun and a neat experience. It is not very scary however as I am a big baby and get scared easily. I found that the actors were less scary/horror and more real/normal. A few times I jumped but not the kind of scares that I had hoped for or have been fearing.

The experience is fun and we did get our las vegas locals discount for $25 per person. That is a bit steep for what you get as after tax for two of us it was $57 and some change.

The best part of the whole experience was taking photos with the staff, characters and that made it worth the trip.

Is just too bad that this is one of those things you only need to do once in a lifetime.

I think I will go check out what the Freakling Bros here in town have to offer with their haunted house. I am in need of a real scare where I produce those blood curdling screams of horror and terror!

The end of your walk through the Goretorium leads you out to the baby dolls lounge where you can stay for a drink or just leave. 

The baby dolls lounge is one of those places where they cater to the rich and famous. Many sections were roped off for VIP and they had many staff members with their security headsets that just seem to ruin any sort of relaxed lounge feel. We were even booted from the chairs we were seated at, a security fellow comes over rudely and says to us sorry but I am going to ""steal"" this table and chairs from you. Yes I shit you not he looks at us and says that while seating another couple. That was rude as fuck and I will not be back and I am a local. 

I am glad we got to check out the Goretorium before they go out of business. After Halloween shall pass their just won't be enough traffic with the price to get in or the snobbish staff at baby dolls lounge to keep it going. It is all about word of mouth and baby my mouth is big!

The two stars are for the Awesome characters that are more than happy to stop and take a photo with you. If not for the cool photos we got I would have been super disappointed with the experience!",2
Arts & Entertainment,"maybe I'm a sissy la la... but this was the scariest haunted house I've ever been too.  nice effects, scary actors and less jumping out of the dark and more following you and whispering creepy shiz.  i don't know if i can return for fear that i will not make it out alive.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"A group of us went there a couple of weeks ago.  It was a little disappointing.  First of all it takes about 4 minutes to go through the whole attraction.  The actors found it as cheesy as I did because they had a hard time staying in character.  For $ 40 per person there should have at least been a drink included.  And as far as the cocktails, watch out!  Gratuity is included but the bartenders are hesitant to tell you this.  For 3 of us the tab was $45 per round, with tip included, normal for Vegas but a little shady.  The only reason I'm giving a second star is because the view from the lounge is good.  Would I go back?  No.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"*Terrible Experience* 

I would not recommend going to this place ever! We where harassed and not only physically pushed by the security but we where violated by them as well. 

5 of us locals decided to come to this haunted house to see what the big ordeal was. We heard many mixed feelings about Goretorium but decided to go to experience for ourselves. 

To make a long story short during the haunted house my friend decided to pull his phone out to take a picture. He was unaware of the no photography policy hence all the excitement that was going on in the beginning. The security guards then yelled at him to put his phone away and that's exactly what he did. The security then followed us out. As we where leaving we heard obnoxious comments from the actors making derogatory remarks about our sexuality. 

As soon as we got outside the security started yelling at my friend trying to confiscate his phone. My friend argued with him and said  he took no pictures. I wasn't going to get involved but I was not going to let my friend get harassed by idiots so I asked my friend, ""did you take a picture?"" and his answer was no. That is when I stepped in. We all started exchanging words then they yelled at us to leave. I said I was not leaving until I speak to a manager.

As we where walking to meet the manager one of the security guards shoved 2 of us to the side which made me levied!!! I then proceeded to explain to the manager on what just happened. He was trying to be very sympathetic with us but unfortunately the stupid security behind us where Harassing us and pointed fingers at us like they where children in elementary. The manager then asked the security to leave because they where causing more of a scene then us. 

Nothing really got resolved because things got more heated as we all kept talking. As we left some of the scary actors outside where very nice and apologetic about the whole situation and calmed us down telling us to don't worry about it and they will see how they can help us out being that we are locals. The nice gentlemen asked me for my business card since I did work in that casino and told me he'll see what he can do and will have someone try and contact me.

The point I am trying to make is that yes we understand that my friend made the mistake to take out his phone to take a picture however he never did take any photos and followed the security's direction by putting the phone away but they should of never harassed us to leave, shove 2 of us off to the side, and call us derogatory names about our sexuality. 


This is sad because we are always very generous in helping out fellow local business. We all know in this economy that we should all help each other out to stay in business, however with the kind of experience we received......none of our help will be offered.  All 5 of us work on the strip and I can assure you we will tell not only our friends and family not to go to this place but I can assure you we will tell all our customers, clients and fellow friends in this industry to never come here ever!

This place won't last!

p.s. Thank you to the 2 scary monsters outside who calmed us down =) you have my business card. Come into any one of my stores and I will take care of you!",1
Arts & Entertainment,"As a HUGE horror freak and of course Eli Roth fan, I was beyond thrilled to get a chance to check this place out. As soon as I heard it was opening I bought my ticket and booked my trip. 

Now I won't say anything that might ruin it for you...no spoiler alerts here!
 
The maze is simply awesome for lack of a better word. I go to Universal Studios every Halloween and I love it but they've got nothing on Goretorium. There was just two of us in my party and as the General Manager told me later while chatting ""There is safety in numbers"" ...let's just say that for a girl who has watched horror movies since a baby and laughs, I'm a bit embarrassed at how much I screamed. I even screamed in the bathroom which is in the lounge and safely out of the maze! 

Once you make it through the maze you are in the Baby Doll Lounge. The waitresses were all sweet and very friendly. The speciality drinks are a little pricey but I suggest trying at least one (preferably Eli's Blood) because they are delicious! Then you can switch to the regular mixed drinks which are all just as good because they have a great bartender. Also, the lounge has the perfect decor for any horror fan and very pretty view of the strip. There are a couple TVs playing some special clips from classic horror to modern day films.

And lastly. I know some people have said it's a one time experience kind of thing but they will be missing out because I hear that they will change it up every so often. Either way, I will be returning every time I'm in Vegas and you should too. 
 
***They really paid attention to every detail and with the brillliant mind of Eli Roth and amazing staff that I had the pleasure meeting this weekend, I have very high hopes for this place and just know it will only get bigger and better.***",5
Arts & Entertainment,"For the cost of entry... as well as the overall experience... I have definitely had better.. The actors/actresses were well dressed and the makeup and overall environment screams scary.. however, once the experience was done... it was done.

Looking back and going through that maze... it was nice.... but that's it... just nice. nothing extraordinary that popped out.. and with how much it cost to go through that? umm... wow.. not worth it in my opinion.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Came here for the grand opening night (free yay! + saw Eli Roth yay!).

Things were pretty cool for the most part, but I was kinda expecting more. Coming from the mind of Eli Roth, I was expecting more f'd up shii. There were some rooms that were entertaining (ie. the wedding and reception rooms) but aside from that -- you are kept begging for more imagination.

The lounge at the end of the haunted house is alright. The view is nice, but it's not as poppin' as you would expect. The whole place just seems to gimmicky outside of October. However, it was fun watching little people run around and zombie go-go dancers fight.

Not sure how long this place is going to be able to stay in business, but they need to figure out how to become relevant year-round.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"i went here on a whim after filming a zombie movie in the desert. i had heard about it, but didn't know much about it. i ended up having so much fun and loving every second! we showed up around 9 with a group of 11 and ended up staying until it closed! LOVED the decor in the Lounge once you get through (wish I could buy it) and the view of the strip was awesome. I went first in my group and mostly laughed since my friends do this for a living, but I also totally jumped and screamed too. i think the end freaked me out the most. they have some good hiding spots! enjoyed watching the movie clips in the lounge too, made me update my Netflix queue. the bathroom was a nice touch. will definitely be going back next time i'm in town!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Do you embrace your dark side? Enjoy the sight of crazed maniacs feasting on the flesh of a still living and screaming victim? Fantasize about being relentlessly chased through a dank basement and into a giant meat grinder by a psycho with a chainsaw? Then the Goretorium will be quite a treat for you.

Brainchild of Hostel creator Eli Roth, the Gen X King of Dismemberment, the Goretorium is a wild mash up of every hard ""R"" horror film you can imagine set in the mysterious basement of the mythical Delmont Hotel, where they check in but they don't check out - at least not with all of their organs intact. 

I purchased the ""Death Row"" VIP pass for $55 and found it to be money well spent. Yes, that's a fair chunk of change. Yes, it is only about a 20 minute experience. But what an experience it was! And for my $55 I got to skip the lines and wander the foreboding Delmont all by myself - well, me and about two dozen bloodthirsty monsters and squealing victims. The VIP pass also got me free admission and a drink (a well drink, not specialty drink) at Babydoll's, the attached club. Babydoll's is a great little hangout with panoramic views of the Strip, a caged zombie go-go dancer and drinks served in blood-rimmed cups. In addition to the free drink, I ordered the specialty drink Eli Roth's Blood for $16.22 - $20 with tip. Pricey but quite good. 

Make a stop by the gift shop on your way out. There you can buy specimens in a jar, severed limbs, and demon dolls. 

Final verdict? Put this on the top of your to-do list in Vegas. It's not cheap but a better use of your money than flushing it down a slot machine. And it's a great fun - as long as murder and mayhem are your idea of a good time.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"This is not scary by any means and basically all gore. I was surprised that they split up my group and had to go with people I didn't know. Maybe it helped that I had a little liquid courage heading through this gore fest (hey, its VEGAS) But the main question is...would I do it again? Yes but I wouldn't pay the price of my discounted ticket.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I love a good scare.  Being familiar with Eli Roth's work and his penchant for gore, it was a no-brainer to check out his Goretorium conveniently located across the street from where we were staying, the Cosmopolitan, while Carol W and I were in town on vacation.  We had discount passes from Travelzoo, so it made for a much less, almost Vegas local priced, albeit still not cheap, hours worth of entertainment.  I won't give up any spoilers, but suffice it to say, there's good fun from beginning to end.  To be honest, Eli Roth's Goretorium is more shock & gore than actually scary.  The gf and I actually found ourselves laughing, but in a good way, as we enjoyed the clever, ""haunted house"" that utilized Hollywood-style makeup and special effects to create an immersive ""goretorium"".  If you want to be scared, then take a pass on this.  If gore mixed with the occasional good startle gets your pulse going, then Eli Roth's Goretorium is for you.  However, check it out now, because I can't see this place staying in business for too much longer since Halloween is a long way away.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"im not big on horror at all whatsoever and i havent event seen the hostel movies in their entireties, but i had a really great time going down to the goretorium with a group of friends! we got the locals discount which was a huge plus because i had heard the tickets were like, 60 bucks beforehand which is too expensive for anything in my opinion... the downstairs area was really cool and the stuff in their giftshop was fun to look at.

going up the stairs to the actual haunted house part there were tvs playing news clips and a guy gave us a schpeil about the history of the place which was funny... but after that i started to get freaked out cuhz theres an elevator gag and im scared as shit at elevators... going thru the rest of the place there were some other cool things though! so after i got over my initial fear i had a really good time... the actors kind of make you a part of their acts if you seem like easy prey... this girl in her underwear said she would rip my friends face off lmao

once you get out of the haunt the lounge was actually kind of mellow in comparison to the attraction which was a nice change so i could actually breathe... the weather was great, the view was nice and the girls dressed as ""babydolls"" were super pretty and the makeup was bitchin lolz i didnt have a drink there in the lounge, but i had one of the slushies downstairs... and for all 9 dollars of it, it was worth it! it was REALLY strong lmao

ide go back again even though im not big on scary things... i kind of wished i had gone for halloween... i can only imagine that everything wouldve been super amped up to complete sensory overload lolz i had a great time!",4
Arts & Entertainment,If you're a horror fan you should definitely check out Goretorium.  It is much scarier than Halloween Horror Nights.  It is somewhat overpriced at $40 but you can pick up 1/2 price tickets at one of the Half-Price show tickets stands along the strip.,4
Arts & Entertainment,"Most of my fellow Yelpers have covered what I would also say; it's hard to find and a little pricey.  Yes, it's overpriced, but it's Vegas.  Everything is overpriced!

That being said, I had a blast there and can't wait to go again during my next Vegas trip.  I'm almost never scared, and this place had me genuinely freaked-out and got me to jump many times!  We had the VIP tickets which included a separate entrance and two drinks at the Baby Doll Lounge.  

The view at the Lounge is amazing; nice place to unwind after 15 minutes of terror!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"So bummed!!!

I am a huge horror fan and love Eli Roth's love of gore, so, I had high hopes for this place.  I heard about the opening back a few months ago and made a mental note to not miss it on my next visit to Vegas...which was last week.

We walked over shortly after arriving to our hotel just to check it out and make sure we knew where it was...we wouldn't be coming back for the attraction for a couple of days.  I have to say I was a wee bit bummed right from the start.  Many of the props in the main area are very generic...the kind of junk anyone can buy online at Halloween.  I throw a big Halloween party every year so I know that props are very important to setting the mood.  Many of these had seams...someone could have taken a pair of scissors or a blade to them to cut the seam down to make them look more realistic.  Also, the Bloody Mary bar was less than impressive...like an after thought.  The only thing that kept me excited as I walked around was the mean and vulgar Evil Santa.  She was scary in a hysterical, schizo kinda way.  We were given 2 $5 off coupons as we walked out.

So, the day comes when I finally get to experience The Goretorium.  I am super pumped and slightly terrified.  We pay our money...which is expensive, but if you are in Vegas you probably shouldn't be counting your every dollar...and are told to proceed up the stairs.  At the top of the stairs there is a rope stopping us from proceeding...we wait...and wait....and wait....and wait.  It felt like a good 5 minutes before my husBAND got irritated and walked back down, but as he turned someone came to greet us.  Weird start, but whatevs.

I really thought this was going to be like walking through a giant haunted hotel with elaborate sets, etc.  An attraction that you could, at times, take your time through to marvel at the fantastic gore.  It wasn't.  It was several rooms set up with various themes.  Rooms that you are rushed through at a ridiculous speed.  People are writing that they were in there for 15 minutes...I am positive that I was out in 7 minutes once first greeted at the top of the stairs.  Again, the props inside were mostly kinda meh.  

However, the actors are amazingly terrifying!!!  I wish they had not rushed us through so quickly, but I absolutely loved the interactions with them.  They are so mean and twisted and don't hold back with the insults.  LOVE IT!!!  A gazillion stars for these guys and gals!!!

At the end of the attraction you stumble upon the Baby Doll bar.  Eh?  It looked like a temporary bar set up in a tiki hut with some fake blood splashed everywhere.  We didn't even stop for a drink.

Overall, my impression was that the attraction ran out of money while in the midst of building.  I can see where big dreams started, but then in the end it all appeared kind of thrown together.  A huge let down for something I expected to be the haunted house to end all haunted houses.  The actors are amazing, though...they really get your heart pumping!!!

I would probably advise friends to skip it, but I would probably return if they were to add to the attraction and make it longer and slightly more scary.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I must admit that I put off going here due to initial unfavorable reviews. My out of town best friend insisted he wanted to give it a shot, so I obliged. When we arrived on a Friday night it was pretty much empty. There was one small group of people ahead of us. We snapped pictures with the naughty evil elf Candy and various body parts that were laying around. We purchased our tickets which came out to $48 for two with local discount including tax. 

We were ushered up a flight of stairs and told to wait. While waiting, a fake local news story keeps playing on the TV that was mounted to the wall. It talks about a serial killer uncovered in Vegas and all the crazy stuff they found in his home. It reallllly set a creepy vibe for me, even with some liquid courage. We were then taken to the actual haunted house and it was very well done. The actors were on point and great..never once breaking character or being cheesy. You could tell they took their jobs seriously. You can't really take your time to look around and admire all of the details put into this place as you are pushed through at what seems to be a timed pace, but I liked what I did see.

 When you come out you're in front of the Babydoll Lounge...it is a cool little lounge with a great view of the strip. Ladies, don't let the bathroom freak you out like it did me. When you go into the stall a motion sensor will go off and make a camera shutter noise as if there is a spycam and then a voice will say something to the effect of ""we got to stop meeting like this""... I first screamed, then laughed. Well done. We later moved to the Bloody Mary bar where the bartender was friendly enough, but let us enjoy our drinks and conversation in peace. After spending an hour or so at the bar, as we are leaving a member of their management team approached us and asked about our experience. I thought that was a major plus.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Being a fan of scary I was looking forward to going to this Haunt on the strip, and I was not disappointed. 
The haunt was really cool, with so many actors inside it and being themed for the holidays made it so much better!
I got to see the Christmas haunt and it is supposed to be up until just after Christmas...may I say run to see it before it is changed back to normal scary...
The elves, the gingerbread men and the nutcracker with the machine gun were awesome!!!! Totally funny, scary and wild at the same time.
I loved the gory musical chairs happening in the front room, and the people working the place staying in character throughout the experience.
The best kept secret on the strip is the babydoll bar/lounge they have set up at the end of the haunt(take the secret passageway to the baby doll lounge through the gift shop) The BEST VIEW of the strip and the wildest entertainment from the haunts characters I had the pleasure of experiencing.

The pacing was a bit off, but it is a bit like a play you are in, so it probably has its shows that are good and better.

If you can go in smaller groups like 2 or 3 would be best so that the actors can reset.

RUN to see this place as soon as you can...it is so much fun!
Don't forget the locals discount ;)",4
Arts & Entertainment,"If you want to have the bejesus scared out of you, this is your place, not a family friendly place. If you want a taste if what awaits you on the inside, just step into bar on the first floor. You will see that the natives are very restless. After you have been initiated in the bar, get your ticket and enter the attraction. After you have been thru and sufficiently disturbed, stop by the Baby Doll Lounge for  a most welcome breath of fresh air, and a most needed touch of the creature, in the form of the many house created cocktails.  Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"We tried to trek to the Goretorium before Halloween, but family sickness held us back.  I quickly forgot about the oddity until the End of the World event last week.  I have to say, I'm quite impressed and can't wait to go back again.  

I was expecting haunted house + gross gore.  That is essentially what we got.  What I didn't expect were holiday themes!  Since Christmas is just around the corner, rather than being the typical Halloween themed ghost, vampires, zombies, etc., this place was decked out as the workshop of St. Nick's evil brother.  The sets were fantastic, and the attention to detail throughout each room was impressive.   We saw one woman jump and turn around and run out before ""the tour"" even started (we got a scare that made some  of us jump before we even entered the main event).  If you like haunted houses, this is a treat.  

I love the actors wandering around acting quirky and creepy before you enter.  It makes the wait in line nearly as entertaining as the maze itself.  And, the fact that the tour dumps you at a bar that overlooks the strip in all it's ridiculous glory (complete with creepy zombie/demons wandering around) - icing on the bloody cake.  If you hate haunted houses just skip right out to the bar where you can enjoy the juxtaposition of a view of the picture-perfect strip with the tourists and club-goers dressed to the nines, while over your shoulder is a wall of baby doll heads, a virginal sacrifice, and the sweet caress of goblin breath on your neck.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Seriously, I was soooo amped! Alas, like a girl dating a man with E.D. I was let down : (

Upon trekking 42 miles from Cosmo and walking past the man with who lets you kick him in the balls for 20$ youll find this little gem. 

Normally I am alll about scary crap, and upon entering I was 50/50. Mainly bc the characters were a little obnoxious... I get it... your a chubby drunk lady.... but what was scary about that? PAUSE... Once I stood in line we were allowed up the stairs and had our little photo op (WE SERIOUSLY HAVE THE BEST PHOTO! CHECK IT OUT!) We have to go through this area and Doug was voted to go first. one fright led to waiting on the stairs, where I was now mysteriously leading, for about 5 minutes. I felt awkward but we were finally let up. Idk if I was more afraid of falling through the floor, or something falling on me but we were directed to stand in the middle. Fast forward to IMHO the scariest part: THE ELEVATOR. I'm hella claustrophobic and scared of elevators in general so I was basically shitting my pants on this one, all whilst April was laughing her ass off... thanks girl!

Once again I led, we went through diff things and I wasnt scared. I honestly got kinda bored! I know! WEIRDO!! I think I was more grossed out by things that looked really unsanitary (Ex Health Dept worker lol!) and thought it was funny to see some random backpack over by ""sick nick"" 

I like some of the small details they did, even the smells! HOPEFULLY THEY WERE INTENTIONAL! But I wasnt the least bit scared. It was however gorey and bloody which I can appreciate. Towards the end theres a black tunnel looking thing, in order to go through you have to get on your knees (Uhhh sorry, I only get on my knees for one thing hunty!) so I just pushed my way through, yay! That spilled into Babydolls which was ok, the view was awesome but it was chilly and the drinks were weakkkkk!

Would I go back? Maybe! But not for 25$!",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Great value specially with my groupon. However I would not pay full price. They take small groups of 6 through the delmont hotel, some scares but not that many. Honestly I was more scared walking up to the baby doll lounge and using the restroom. Also, we got their at 7:20 and had to wait till 8pm because they were in an intermission.",4
Arts & Entertainment,This is only reveiw for the tix booth! I didnt get a chance cuz we found it on our way outta town and didnt have time go check it out...but it will be my first stop back in lv. The decor. Was mad cool...i bought some leather jewelry. If ur into freks and scares CHECK IT OUT! A UNQUE LAS VEGAS THRILL!,4
Arts & Entertainment,"Just stay away. Dont go. The only thing people are screaming for is their money back. 

This place has GREAT detail, but is so cheesy and hoaky, it makes morning radio look like it should have an emmy. Even the actors knew it was bad! 

Bloody Mary couldnt get the crowd any bit excited for a mediocre attraction. 

The ""elevator"" employee put his head down in shame. 

$35 to go through, not even work $5.",1
Arts & Entertainment,awesome!!,5
Arts & Entertainment,"Being an actress at one of the premier haunts in Southern California, I have high expectations for haunts. I went to Las Vegas this past weekend with a fellow horror fan and was THRILLED to hear they had a year round haunt! Once I heard, there was no doubt that I would be going inside.

We got there and paid $28.50 to go inside after our $5 off coupon. I was impressed with the pictures on the walls, the music, and the creepy solo actress they had outside as people waited in line. The line was short, but we still waited almost an hour to get in as they only let in groups of 5 or 6 at a time. I was okay with that as I knew it gave each group a chance to really experience the house and have a more intimate experience.

Upon entering the house you have to watch a LOOONNNGGG newscast that lost my attention, but I was still excited to get in. After the newscast you go upstairs and are met by a bellhop who gives you some back story. After listening to him you enter an elevator which has an operator... this is where it started going poorly. The actress was trying, but had little to go off of.

When you actually get inside the house and start going from room to room the detail in the props is extraordinary. They really put a lot of time and detail into how the place looked, I was looking around to try and get possible ideas for next year at my haunt. I was very impressed with how well the places was decorated.

The acting at the Goretorium was a joke, I am a self proclaimed chicken and not hard to frighten and I did not even jump one single time. The girls screams were lame, the one liners were lame and actually made me laugh. I didn't pay to go to a comedy show. They had the same actors from room to room and just NO energy coming from them, It was only 9PM or so, which should have been the peak of the night.

They had a couple of cool special effects such as a guy disappearing and a girl legitimately looking cut in half, but even then her screams were forced. They didn't have many actors, and the actors just didn't seem to try. 

As for the actors' makeup, they might as well not have had any on. For how well the place itself was decorated and being in Las Vegas you would think some time would be put into their makeup, but it wasn't.

I would have been more satisfied had it only cost me $10-$15. It left a lot to be desired. 

I wouldn't waste time going... just not worth it.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Came to Vegas on a company bonding trip and headed to the Goretorium on a Sunday night to pee our pants in fear together. If you're into haunted houses and want to do something other than gamble, go to a snobby ass nightclub, or a snobby ass strip club, this is cool alternative. 

The whole premise of the haunted house revolves around the story of a murderous couple who owned the hotel. Apparently there's also some kind of serial killer on the loose. There was a woman eating her newborn baby's head (umbilical cord still attached and all) and a bunch of messed up randomness that will make you feel oogie. 

Overall, I thought it was fairly well done. It reminded me one of the mazes at Universal's Halloween Horror Nights, with less professional looking make-up. All the actors in the maze were very into it, even though I'm guessing Sunday night isn't a popular night for them. 

Oh! There's a cool photo-op before you enter the maze. Might not be worth it if it's just you and a friend, but if it's a group of people, I think it's worth the money to shell out to purchase. I personally look terribly hilarious in the picture and it is now hanging up on our office wall. 

TIP: There are Goretorium workers hanging out on the street near Planet Hollywood and the bridge that connects that casino with the Aria handing out $5 coupons off the price of admission.",4
Arts & Entertainment,I was terrified from start to finish and may or may not have made the wall of fame because of it. Everyone in my group was on the verge of tears so if you're in Vegas and you like to be scared you have to visit. The only downside is that it's rather difficult to find.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"My girlfriend and I are huge haunted attraction fans, so naturally, Goretorium is of interest to us when we are in town. Coupled with the fact that the G also is home to a bar with a great view of The Strip - Baby Dolls Lounge - it's definitely a spot we like to frequent!

Goretorium opened in October last year, and we visited then; this past weekend, we returned to see how it was holding up since opening and post-Halloween season. We were prepared for the worst, but were VERY pleased and excited to see that it's holding up quite nicely, and in several ways, is actually better now than when it first opened!

There are deals online as far as discounts go, so do your research before buying.

The attraction is a large maze experience with great scenes and fun gory visuals along the way. The budget for this was about $10 million, which is huge for a haunted attraction. For SoCal visitors, I'd equate this to the quality of maze you find each year at Universal Studios Hollywood's Halloween Horror Nights. The length of experience is about 15-20 minutes and the talent (monsters) is really good. Definitely worth a visit, and if you are a haunt fan, this is a must-see when you are in town.

At the exit of the maze is Baby Dolls Lounge, the Goretorium's full bar with a startlingly awesome view of the Las Vegas Strip, Cosmopolitan and CityCenter. Heat lamps keep guests toasty on cold nights at this horror-themed bar, which features regular and signature drinks. Eli's Blood is especially tasty, which I recommend, as well as Blue Death! 

NOTE: Guests wanting to visit Baby Dolls Lounge do NOT have to go through the maze itself; it is open to the public.

Goretorium is Vegas' only year-round haunted attraction, so horror fans can get their fix any time they pass through Sin City!

By the way - the bathrooms are fully-themed and awesome! No spoilers here; just venture in and experience them for yourself!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Good place.  To be honest not worth 48$ for 2 people.  Kind of steep for 10-15 minutes.  Plus the Photo charge.  I know they need to make $ because how many times would a person go back for the same expectations of a chainsaw around the corner (well probably morre than a few).  I just think that if it was cheaper they could attract repeat business.  15$ per person seems reasonable.  Or if they charge $20+ dollars give them a drink ticket at least you will keep them in your establishment drinking.  

Overall I did scream a couple times and its a good date spot!",3
Arts & Entertainment,"This place is great! It is a little on the pricey side for the evening admission (the day time is without monsters and just a walk through) there is a guy out front that hands out a $5 discount, so it's manageable. I asked if there was anything we could do for additional discount because it was my friend's 30th birthday. They couldn't do an additional discount, but they gave us a few 2-for-1 drink discounts. The place was a lot of fun too, it's a decent walk through, with a lot of attention to detail. The actors are really fun and really get into their characters. They're not afraid to be rude to you and fully get into things. A lot of places that do stuff like this hold back, but this one was really a lot of fun. I know some people say it's not worth the price, but if this is the sort of thing you are into you'll appreciate the acting and the details and it IS in fact worth it. Also, the people running it are SUPER nice and awesome. My friend and I both bought a picture at the end and they printer was having issues, so we only got the first picture out and they were working on the printer. It was closing and I felt bad, so I asked if I could just pay the difference and get a hat. They just let me have the hat, mind you, the second picture is only $5 extra and a hat is like $20. So my friend and I leave and we're like 8 stores down the line as they come running out to us because they got the printer working and gave us our picture. So we got a hat for free and they RAN out and found us to give us the picture. I've never had service that nice ANYWHERE. I totally recommend this place, for the scares, the atmosphere, and the AWESOME people!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"We went shortly after opening so there were not many people there.  The concept is excellent and the draw you in factor was great.  We had never heard of it before but I am a big horror/gore fan.  I thought this was fun, but not spooky.  The effects are elaborate but there was very little of the shock factor.  We saw some of the same characters so many times that we felt like were at a reunion.  For my taste, there was too much interaction/talking by the actors and too little boo!  There were a couple of times we lingered checking out the sets *L*  Good attraction if you have a coupon for it.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"As one of those rabid horror fans who eats this kind of stuff up, I almost felt obligated to give this 5 stars. But, you know, ""in the interest of fairness"" and all... I think something around 4 is more than generous. 

I came here with my gf and a friend around 2pm. $5 BLOODY MARYS! And they're fucking amazing! And it's from a mix, which almost makes it better since most mixes suck,. Anyway, we were informed that the actual attraction won't be open until 5pm, but we had the option of doing a day tour and then coming back later for the big show. Sounded good to me, so we got combo tickets for $28. Do whatever you can to get that good of a deal, because the whole shebang ain't worth full price. 

The day tour was cool. Our guide told us about the ""history"" of the hotel - cannibalism, torture, sausage grinders - while we got to see the props and bloody stages before they were dressed for the night. This was definitely worth it if you're a total fucking nerd like me who wants to see the inner working of the maze. 

We came back later than night for the real deal. After a brief wait, our group was escorted upstairs and off we went. The show they put on was a lot of fun. It isn't so much scary (although my gf would probably disagree) as it was extremely entertaining in a Gran Guignol kinda of way. Lots of theatrics and screaming and bloody murder and cool trick effects. I enjoyed it more than most haunted mazes because you could tell these performers are very much into what they do. 

There's a lounge outside once it ends, but we walked out to find no one there and it was kinda lame. I'd suggest skipping that and drinking elsewhere.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Took me 5 different visits to finally check this place out.  

Attempt #1:  With my daughter the day after grand opening. Daughter chickened out.

Attempt #2:  My teenager and I came back 4 days later.  She found out that Justin Bieber was here for the grand opening.  That inspired her to give it another try. We arrived and she again chickened out because they told us that the sounds and characters were realistic.

Attempt #3:  Homeboy was in town and was down for this.  But too much drinking earlier in the day got him too sick. We were concerned that he'd lose it and create his own Goretorium.

Attempt #4:  Yelp event that sounded cool.  I had to cancel because I had to head out of town for work.

Attempt 5:  Finally, I made it.  Was at PH with a friend to play poker and ended up here.  After all the attempts, I have to say it was just okay.  Maybe all the hype ruined it for me, but I didn't find it scary at all.  But it's not a haunted house that's meant to scare.  It's more of a gore exhibit created to gross you out.  As you walk in, you're always anticipating something that may pop out. Yes, the blood, props, and gore all looked real.  Some areas are tight and in a way you can feel cramped or claustrophobic.  

Overall, would say it was just okay and will probably come back just to see what the next theme is like.  What really brings the rating down is the price, which is about $50 for two.  If it was cheaper, I'd probably rate them a little higher.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I went with a few girlfriends for a night out, using groupons that made the entrance fee $17.  We had a fun time, but I probably would have been less thrilled had I paid full price (even at the locals' rate).

As echoed by other reviewers, there was much more gore than scare (hence the name, no?).  Pretty much everything that happened was expected, though there were a couple surprises.  The actors were generally ok, though I do wonder how they can scream at the top of their lungs for extended periods!  Bravo!

I absolutely loved the lounge that you are ""dumped"" into at the exit.  The views are spectacular and the bar was decent.  We enjoyed watching people exit the attraction as we sipped on our cocktails.

All said, it was a fun experience, yet not one I'm likely to repeat.

Here's a tip for those driving: Park in the PH parking garage (I always take Koval to Harmon to Audrie), walk through the miracle mile shops out to LVB, and make a left.  The Goretorium is up the escalator above the Walgreens.  Super easy.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"The Goretorium is hands down the best ""haunt"" I've ever been to. It uses many of the same tricks and scares that other haunts have but everything here feels more effective. The main reasons for this is very simple; you walk through the haunted hotel in very small groups where you can take more time to take in the sights and sounds. This also means that the actors have more time to spend with YOU, and this makes a world of difference. The actors here do so much more than just jump out of corners; they actually interact with you. I would say more but I don't want to give anything away!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"So was it or was it not? The billboard prank with the suited dummies over the freeway ? Or was it really wall street ?

Anyhow, came to an invite only opening. The line was ridiculous, but what can you expect from a highly anticipated opening on the strip?

Hearded like cows, we moved through the lines with no brushes with fire. 

Finally, we got our 'tickets' headed up the stairs and greeted with a bellman.. with really great décor and life like'ism. 

Proceeded into the elevator.. .... ... .. then the end to baby dolls lounge. 

What ? Did you think I was going to spoil anything?

Actors/Characters - GREAT
Haunt Design - AWESOME
Decors - IMPECCABLE
Scare factor - mediocre

To each is own! If you come with a fun group of people, I'm sure its to die for. 

A little short I thought for the admission price, but worth going. 

Check them back out as they will change their theme around every so often. 

Didn't get out BABYDOLLS after, its Vegas after all and we live in it, plus it was a school night :)

Enjoy the scare.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Being a massive Eli Roth Fan I could hardly wait to get here! We went out on the strip early and stopped by around noon to look around.  My hands were literally shaking with anticipation!  We purchased two t-shirts and took some pics sitting in the electric chair.  

  Came back later and went through the haunt with my boyfriend, my daughters and another couple.  It was hard to contain my excitement! I was jumping around and clapping my hands and laughing! I wonder if the talent worried I was the crazy one! My one daughter (age 9) almost freaked out but she's a tough cookie so we all made it through alive, with her even sassing some of the resident psychos of the Delmont Hotel! She came out with a huge smile and so did I! Loved the interactions and every character was great! I won't spoil any of the moments for you but there were some shocking and messy scenes complete with appropriate smells and sounds! Gag worthy for those who aren't used to Gore! 

  Looking forward to going again and seeing different set ups through different Holidays! Can't wait to go back with my best friend who is an ever bigger Roth fan than myself!  All in all it was an amazing time, we were very entertained and loved the experience! Well worth the trip!! Thank you Goretorium for a great and memorable time!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I stumbled upon this place with my girlfriend and after a few drinks it sounded like a fantastic idea. The price was a bit high, but the staff there sure did sell it well, so we decided to go for it.

We stood in line for 1 hour and 15 minutes, in a hot stairwell. 

So needless to say, going through the haunted house, sobering up and bored out of my mind wasn't the most entertaining experience I ever had.

Was it worth the $60? 

Probably not.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Another awesome night here! Where else can you go to a fun haunted house in February! Great staff, excellent sets, enthusiastic performers, and it ends in a bar with an awesome view of the strip! What more can you ask for?",5
Arts & Entertainment,"My husband had a groupon for here and we're huge horror fans so we had to check this out at some point.
There were some great parts to the tour like the exorcism in the lobby and the elevator ride but otherwise it was pretty uninspired. It wasn't much different than any other Halloween maze. The actors were fun but most of the scares were the typical jump out at you stuff.
The baby doll lounge at the top had an amazing view and the beer prices were great for the strip. That is worth visiting and I will return to that. You can go to that without going on the tour. 
All in all it was worth going through once at the half off groupon price, not the full price. I expected more from Eli Roth.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I think of myself as one who likes a good scare just slightly more than the next and I am highly fascinated with blood, guts and gore, however, Eli Roth you failed to scare me! 
The sets were fashioned in typical Vegas style (which is better than some scary sets I've experienced, and the actors were enthusiastic enough, but I didn't jump one time- My heart didn't race, I wasn't afraid to enter the next room and I was bummed out by the DISCOUNTED rate of $25 bucks that I paid. 

I was more afraid walking through Downtown Vegas during the day than I was walking through the Goretorium. 

Oh... and the bar you exit into was quiet - not happening at all. Took in the nice view for a second then was outta there.

If you're a horror fan, like to be scared, fascinated or intrigued by death, go on a ghost tour or something but don't spend your money here.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Awesome exhibit.  

If you're a horror fan, you have to go, but if you're a horror fan, you would already know that.

This is basically your standard haunted house, but done with a much higher degree of special effects and professionalism.

I won't spoil what happens inside, but the backstory is that a crazy family used a hotel as a cover for their murderous habits.  The effects are great and the actors inside get really into it and put on a great show.  Copious amounts of blood and simulated mutialation and torture to satiate any jaded gore hound out there, and for the less grizzled, well there's a safe word.

The bar, Baby Dolls, is attached to the show.  If you want to sit and watch the strip surrounded by macabre horror decor, that's the place to go.  Just be prepared for strip priced drinks.  Personally, I would just pass on it and either leave or go to the gift shop.

One of the things I enjoyed most was talking to the staff afterwards in the gift shop, where I bought a tshirt.  Horror fans all, we had a long discussion about our favorite obscure horror gems.  The three girl staff members and I discussed Romero vs. Fulci, Audition, Cannibal Holocaust, a Serbian film, and other horrific favorites of ours.

I heard they change the show around every couple of months, I will definitely return the next time I am in Vegas.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I didn't actually go to the Goretorium, I went to the Baby Doll Lounge (named aptly for the huge amount of baby doll heads on the walls) upstairs. So my review is actually for there, but it was not listed as a separate area. 

You can see the baby doll lounge area if you look straight up walking from the Harley Davidson bridge to the building with the Goretorium in it. 

When you first walk in to the venue, you can go slightly left of the ticket booth and go up the stairs to the baby doll lounge. Make sure to check out the random interactive horror type stuff in the hallways. Try not to jump when the container jumps at you when you go by!

Came here on a Friday night for some friends spinning and had a pretty good time. Most nights here are free with no cover, and I think they have the occasional headliner. Most excellent view from the open balcony with seating along it (mostly comfy little square cubes) and some booths. The bathrooms have a nice attendant, and though small were super clean. 

I'm guessing they have special hookah nights, because of all the hookahs in the background-they weren't out this night for some reason though.

The venue was small as far as venues go, or maybe it extended further but it was roped off this night-I'll have to go back and check some more. 

I went on a First Friday night to check out the open format EDM, and had a pretty good time, and I'm thinking I'm going to check out the Dance Therapy Monday nights-didn't fully read the flier. The drinks were average price, but I'm sure you could bring a group here and get some special rates. I wish they spent a little more money on a surround sound system that didn't sound so empty in the big balcony area. I also didn't take note if they served food.

But like I said, I mainly enjoyed the southern facing view of the strip, had a few drinks, snapped a few pics and continued on with the night. Would I stay there all night? Probably not, but perfectly great place to make  a pit stop on a roving party adventure. 

Hope that helps! 

Cheers!

Arts & Entertainment,"Hallowing in March!  What could be better?  First of all this place is hidded on a second level that I never knew was there!  I want to go back when I have more time to take it all in.   Visited on a Saturday night and there was a pretty big line....but rest assured there is a bar right there to serve you while you wait.  There is an electric chair when you first walk in-the couple I was with said that it actually shocks you if you try to sit in it for pictures.  Thank goodness I was with someone who had been there before because stupid me would have been the one to get the ass-shock. lol  The music was killer (pardon the pun) but where else can you enjoy some Rage Against the Machine and angry music! :)  While in line you can see the bloody pieces of dismembered bodies to take pictures with.  Gross but fun.  The spook of the thing wasnt too scary but I did scream a few times.  Its just fun.  I totally want to go back.  At the end it leads you to this Babydoll lounge that overlooks the strip.  Nice view to kick back and have a drink...and enjoy the music.  The best part is all the bloody tables and seats which makes you hesitate before sitting down. haha.  All in all a super fun experience.  I definitely recommend the Groupon though....because Im not so sure that the real ""tourist"" price is justified.  I think they have a local discount if you tell them too.  Check it out...you'll be glad you did. ;)",3
Arts & Entertainment,"We had a Groupon for this. Still feel we overpaid. Rather boring, not scary. Though some of the props were way cool, the actors were terrible. Not to mention the whole thing lasts roughly 17 minutes. Meh, I wouldn't go back. Can't believe they actually have annual passes for this. Why???? I think this place will close fairly soon.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"This is a MUST-SEE place for horror fans from around the world, but get here fast because I'll be surprised if it stays open for more than a year. The actual haunted maze is beautiful once you get inside, however there are several factors that make this place a real nightmare to deal with. 

First - The Price. We bought our VIP tickets online for $60 a piece. $120 for a 15 minute horror maze is too much, unless one of the chicks inside is giving out bloody old fashioneds. The decor is all top notch, but service sucks. Upon arrival we were told to stand in one line, we waited 30 minutes for our VIP access while we watched the regular line moving quickly. After the maze you are kicked out into the Baby Doll Lounge for which there was supposed to be a cover...that's why we paid the extra $$$ but I didn't see anybody paying shit to get in there, so why did we pay then? Makes no sense.

Second - The Staff at the Baby Doll Lounge. We were greatest pleasantly by a cute waitress in a doll themed costume - personally I think she should have been a little bloodier- never offered us a drink menu, which we saw other guests being handed. The place was empty. The view of the strip is awesome, but the whole bar is exposed to the outside along one wall, so it will be interesting to see how it does once the wind and rain hit in the winter.  Took us over 20 minutes to get our first round of drinks. The decor is cool, but nowhere near the level of downstairs. Needs more gore, blood, bones to make it more special. The website and everything I've read says there were supposed to be zombie go-go dancers there but we never saw any. Kind of disappointing as I really have a dead chick fetish. We sipped our drinks but after 30 minutes our waitress never returned, other guests around us were bitching about service, so we went to the bar to close our tab and leave. Apparently, according to the staff, a new POS system had been installed but none of the servers could access it, so ordering and paying became a horrific scenario.

Third - VIP Experience = Bullshit. We're kitschy people and love having those souvenir photos taken, and we would have dropped the cash for one in a second had we know they even offered this here. From what we can tell if you get in the regular line you get your photo take in front of some red drapes with a scary little person...we had no idea this opportunity even existed until we were leaving and saw the screens by the gift shop, which leads me to the final disappointment...

Four - The Gift Shop. All the hype said this was going to be the ultimate gift shop for horror fans. I've been reading Fangoria since issue #3 and Rue Morgue since issue #2...I'm an award winning filmmaker and a horror novelist. I eat, drink, sleep, breath, and shit HORROR. My dick was hard for what the potential slew of merch that awaited me. Now the decor on the shop is wicked, but the shop itself is just a few piles of t-shirts and hoodies with the Goretorium logo. There were a few keychain a scattered about, some shot glasses, one set of shelves filled with dusty Living Dead Dolls, a few books laid on a cart and a few bloody  body parts at the register. Rather disappointing if you ask me. Whoever is stocking this place needs to do some research. If you are truly building a world wide destination for horror fans then put some shit in here we really want. Maybe some autographed Eli Roth stuff, maybe some really high end shit like Goretorium scenes reenacted with dead mice like the chick from Oddities: San Francisco makes, maybe let me buy that headless torso with the great set of tits on it, maybe signed 1st edition horror books, bloody & sexy Baby Doll lounge stuff for our women to wear, maybe Goretorium condoms with packaging that says ""You're Fucked""...are you seeing what I'm saying? Every horror fan has their black shirts that we wear to our horror conventions with pride - but give us that crazy knickknack shit those vendors sell that makes us wish we had robbed an armored truck before we got there.

Deep in my heart I WANT this place to KICK ASS. I realize that there are some business dealings on the backend and some investments need to be recouped, but I also know without a doubt that unless some shit changes soon that the Bubba Gumps moving in next to you is going to be staring at a vacant storefront next year.

Mr. Eli Roth and all the management behind the Goretorium, please prove me the fuck wrong and make me eat my filthy words covered in maggot-strewn filth. But please just don't take my words in vain and think I'm the only severed dick spewing my infectious seed. Read the other reviews around here and learn from your mistakes. Isn't that always the #1 lesson in any good horror film?",2
Arts & Entertainment,"What can I say, I was pretty disappointed. The effects were pretty awesome or what we saw of them. They rushed us through so quickly that we weren't able to see everything in each scene. We also didn't appreciate being soaked with water in one of the scenes. As we passed through the actor just continuously squirted us with water, to the point that I had water dripping from my hair and my back was soaked. The other people in our group were also soaked. I am very glad we did not pay full price for it. We purchased 2 for 1 Groupon. I would suggest that anyone thinking of going either try to get a Groupon or go to Cheap Tix 4 Tonite. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE. It's not worth it.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Eli Roth is known more for his obsession with torture porn than subtle scares, so I kind of knew what I was getting into. There's even a video upstairs just cycling through the kill and gore scenes from tons of horror movies.

You start out on a tour with a guide and everything, but the acting is pretty laughable and the elevator ride/drop/crash (?) is very ineffective.  Once inside the actual labyrinth (a maze has dead ends) there's a moment where you see a giant butcher standing in the fog, just staring at you. It's actually pretty intimidating, and gave me a bit of hope that maybe this would be cool after all, but after that it's all downhill.

Most of the walkthrough consists of watching girls getting butchered as the actresses scream and plead for their lives. Occasionally someone will try to pop out from around a corner, but everything feels so staged and ridiculously gratuitous that there's no tension. You're basically just strolling through some random Internet user's sick fantasies, and they're honestly pretty boring.

At the end you get sprayed with water and then have to squeeze through a giant rubber anus to get out. This place gets two stars only because of the Baby Doll Lounge, which is the upstairs club exclusive to the Goretorium.

I kind of feel like this is one of Las Vegas' best kept secrets, as the open view of the strip is great and there weren't too many people there, even on a Saturday evening. The music and decor was also pretty awesome, so I enjoyed my time there.

But as for the Goretorium itself, it was pretty lame, and definitely not worth the hefty price of admission. Just YouTube a montage of death scenes from Hostel and save yourself the trouble.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I was compelled to write a review of this attraction after reading some of the poor reviews recently. Lighten up people! You are expecting way too much! My bf and I went this past December and were looking forward to a fun night with some scares. In my opinion we got way more than that. Yes it lives up to classic Vegas pricing, but I think that's fair because everything is pricey in that city. We both had a blast! The actors were horrifying and the scenery was out of my worst nightmares. The acting was genius and I was drenched with sweat from the adrenaline rush. The bar had an awesome view as well. God bless you Eli Roth! You gave us a scare and a fun night. Please stay open so we can get married here!!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"This was such a fun thing to do in Vegas!  This was very well done and it scared the shit out of me!  Not the typical maze with people popping out at you.  Lots of detail and a story rather than just walking through a dark maze.  The bar upstairs is really cool if you are a horror fan.  The bathroom lights flicker off and on and something screamed at me when I was in the stall.  The mirrors flow blood when the sink comes on.
I took my kids they are 12 and 13 and pro's when it comes to haunted houses. I wouldn't recommend this for kids unless they are teenagers.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I had a lot of fun here. We did the day and night tour.  Had a little bit of time before it started, so we grabbed the best bloody mary I think I have ever had. 

I am super gullible and super skiddish.  So I was glad we did the day tour before going back for the night tour, so I could actually look around and enjoy the bloody sights.  For awhile I thought it was actually REAL/true. hahaha but that's me being gullible. 

We returned at night and it was SO creepy!  The characters were all very into it.  And they could tell I was skiddish and took full advantage of that.  

Not sure if I would do it again, but it was fun, and amusing.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Being from Los Angeles and having gone to Horror Night at Universal Studios, I did not expect much from a small haunted house. Yet, I had a ton of fun! 

The amount of detail and the acting that they put in were outstanding. 

By the end of the maze, you end up at their bar. It has an amazing view of Vegas but  the bar seemed too much like a temporary set up. It felt dead there because of the lack of people at the bar. We went to a bigger bar instead.

I think that their full admission price is too much, but it was worth it for the discounted price that I paid. Check out those Half Price Ticket booths around M&M World and Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile shops to buy your tickets.

I would suggest going here if you run out things to do in Vegas or want to try something different in Vegas with a group of friends, and only if you pay for the discounted admission.  

Go there without many expectations and just have fun!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Great fun! A little tipsy by the time we arrived here. It is a little pricey for admission, about $30.00 a person. There is an electric chair in front of the admission counter with 2 zombies next to it, which gives you a zap if you touch it! Based off of the mythical murderous proprietors of the ""Delmont Hotel."" It has all the typical cheesiness of classic horror films.

Inside our tour guide was murdered before he was able to get in the elevator with us. We were stuck in an elevator with the psycho that murdered our tour guide. Then the elevator dropped to the basement. All alone we had to find our way out. We went through a tunnel that made me dizzy. Then I was kidnapped by a crazy murderer that wanted my skin for his girlfriend. Zombies get up in your face, very creepy. Religious sacrifices and a gory torture chair. 

After you are finished, you have access to a bar with a spectacular view of the strip. Right across the street from the Cosmopolitan. Good music and not overcrowded. 

You must go in the bathroom for the finale of the experience. After you survive the maze there are creepy sounds in the bathroom and the lights went out on me for a few seconds. Freaked me out! Good kind of scary fun! Even funny and campy at times.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"If you're a gore/horror fan you'll be disappointed.  If youre easily scared you'll love the place. 

Best part is the view at the end!!

Groupon your ticket!!",3
Arts & Entertainment,"My review is for the Baby Doll Lounge only, which (of all the many bars I visited in Vegas) was the only spot on the strip where I didn't feel surrounded by the cast of Jersey Shore.",4
Arts & Entertainment,Totally worth the trip to Vegas! Very scary! I was practically running through the whole things and still was scared. Plus the view at the end of it (from the lounge) was amazing. I highly recommend this for something new & unique to do in Vegas.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"After our great experience back in October, my best friend and I decided to head back to Vegas to try it again since we were told that the haunt would change every few months. We planned our trip entirely around a trip to the Goretorium, including staying next door at Planet Hollywood so that it was an easy walk to the attraction. 

When we were there in October, the haunt closed at 2 AM and we stayed in the beautiful, elegant Baby Doll Lounge until then; therefore, this time we checked into the hotel, ate a relaxing dinner, and changed clothes before heading over around 11. Last time we got there around 8 PM and it didn't get busy until around 11. We got there at 11 and sat at the bar to get a drink. We noticed that the decor in the lobby had gone from much more subtle and classy horror stuff to really cheesy stuff that could be found at any major Halloween store, including really fake cobwebs, robotic zombies, etc. Everything looked more like something you'd see in your neighbor's front yard in October than a world-class 'cutting edge' haunt in Las Vegas. My friend and I were told that they close at midnight on weeknights now and 1 on weekends, which shocked us. We hurriedly drink our drinks (noticing that the trademark 'Bloody Mary' actress who usually sits above the bar heckling customers was not on duty), then get in line for the haunt. There are about ten people in front of us, and since the haunt's about to close, they rush us through in one group--- even the tour guide remarked on how big this group was. We stood in the waiting area for a moment and we didn't get to take the signature photos which are part of the souvenir experience; they were in a hurry to get us out of there, so the photos weren't even being offered. 

The guide was working off a script, and even though he was a very nice guy, the script was cheesy and incredibly predictable. We were crammed into the elevator with a lot of middle-aged people, including this one housewife who was acting 'hysterical' to get attention and screaming at every little thing. The group was being rowdy and loud so that the few of us who actually WANTED to hear the tour guide couldn't even do so, but he didn't do anything to quiet them or make it more enjoyable for those of us who were obviously being annoyed by the rude guests. We walked through the haunt and immediately I noticed the changes--- THERE WERE NO ACTORS. We were being led through rooms that were completely empty; the big scares came from hydraulic puffs of air or loud bangs that the tour guide made on walls as people walked by. Finally we came to a room where a girl was being 'tortured', but her acting was ridiculously bad and unbelievable and the room was lit so brightly you could see the poor quality of her makeup job. I kept count through the haunt--- there were only five live performers, plus our tour guide, in the entire thing; a maniacal chef (by far the best), the two girls who got tortured to death, a girl standing on a podium in the 'casino' room, and a zombie girl in the very end in the banquet hall.  

I wasn't scared ONCE; I was annoyed, yes, and wanted a refund. When we emerged from the end of the haunt, we were in the beautiful and picturesque Baby Doll Lounge, which already had all of the lights turned on, the chairs flipped upside down on the tables, and no staff in sight except a janitor sweeping. We told a bartender in a light but disappointed tone ""Aw, we were hoping to stay here and drink!"", he said back in a rather snotty voice ""Well, there are plenty of other places in Vegas you guys can do that."" Yes, we know, but we wanted to spend our money THERE, with the great horror decor and the tasty drinks and the beautiful view of the Strip. In fact, that was the main highlight we had been discussing when planning our trip to Vegas. So to be so rudely dismissed was a little off-putting for two fans like ourselves.

We headed back downstairs, where a merchandise girl asked how our experience was. I told her that we were very disappointed and that it had been much better the first time; she said that they'd heard that from a lot of people and that the haunt was 'experimenting' with different techniques to scare people. When we left at midnight, disappointed and disheartened, I emailed the official Facebook page to tell them about our experience. They sent back a very nonchalant ""Sorry about your luck, sometimes people don't have fun. We can't control that. Also, sorry you came too late to have a good time; our hours are posted everywhere. Hope you give us a try next time you're in town"" email. Yes, they may have changed their hours, but when the Goretorium launched it was promoted as a year-round haunt for Las Vegas. Had we known that the hours had changed since October... 

Either way, we won't likely be back. We will stick to Universal Horror Nights; at least they know how to treat their VIPs.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I have been here twice, and had a great time on both occasions.  My hubby is a disabled veteran  in a wheelchair, and I was concerned that he wouldn't be able to enjoy it, but the staff were amazing - we were let in through the VIP entrance, and at various points in the maze a lady popped out from seemingly nowhere to help hubby into a lift, round a corner etc... I was touched and impressed.

The haunt is great fun, and amazingly detailed... both visits (months apart) were fantastic - it is what it is... a haunted house... but with Eli Roth touches everywhere.  I personally loved it, but it was the helpful personal attention of the staff, from start to finish, that sticks in my mind - husband is so often excluded from these kind of things because of the chair... the fact that they were not only accommodating of, but totally prepared for a disabled visitor  made it doubly enjoyable... thank you to all of the staff.

As a previous reviewer suggested, the exit into Babydolls is a tad sphincter-like, but the bar is a great place to look at the strip and listen to some great music.  Actually this is my new favorite stop on the strip now... but i must say i have yet to see the ""Bloody mary"" actress.  Not that it dampened our experience, but it would have been nice.  BTW the current Groupon price of $17 is excellent.   I'm a local and I really enjoyed my experiences - and I plan to go again for my birthday next week.

UPDATE: Forgot to mention the bathrooms... the mirrors bleed!!!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"i got band from goretorium face book page for a bad review i gave about what a rip off it is and only a handful of actors left since openning. 
not worth the 30+ dollars and at 15.00 a drink (very small) i wouldn't recomend this venue to anyone who is into horror/terror.
i would be interested in buying some of the props when they close.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Made of point of checking this place out on our recent trip to Vegas. Before getting to it we spoke with a taxi driver who hoped to see us again to hear what we thought of the place as he'd had previous fares state that is was a terrible experience.

I can't say that it was terrible, I did however feel that it was cluttered and rushed. I'm glad we visited and also glad we got tickets for 50% off from tix-4-tonite.

I did enjoy the babydoll lounge and its overpriced cocktails.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I love haunted attractions and i consider myself a Haunted house aficionado hahah.    I am giving this a 2 because of all the hype on it and its failure to deliver. It is a complete let down, as are most haunted attractions in the past few years. 
The outside is more fun than the inside. They tell you it is 20 min to go through... YEAH RIGHT!!!!  maybe including the  long video they show you 100 times while you are waiting. It was maybe 10 min and I am being VERY generous with that. The themes could be good but i don't know they just fall short. I expected more from a serious horror film maker. The gore doesn't even really look good.  There were a couple of cool scenes but most were just cheesy. I don't recommend this to anyone. We got our tickets for $21 each but they charge $30 at the door. This is maybe worth $5 to $10 at best. Everyone talks about the great view at the end but it really was just average as well. Save your cash.  Check out my many many other Haunted attraction reviews.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"awfull!!! we paid 53 $ for 5 minutes of what you never pay in any amusement  park...
defenetly... t they rying to get the tourism to pay for an awful  experience.... we came from spain and we got that 1000 better in any ammusement park.... very, very  disappointing...
and expensive.... probably they they need to amortized.... dont even waist your time...
nada que ver! el pasaje del terror del tibidabo 1000 veces mejor! y gratis!!!!.",1
Arts & Entertainment,Not very scary.  Just a walking with some gory mannequins and a few people.  Otherwise not long enough and the wait to get in was tremendous.  Waiting almost thirty minutes.,1
Arts & Entertainment,"Wow! Cannot believe the mixed reviews this place has!!

My boyfriend and I went on a trip to Vegas this past week to celebrate our sixth anniversary. We both LOVE horror and we're big fans of Eli Roth (Cabin Fever rules! See it!!) so were so excited to visit the Goretorium.

We got our tickets on the Goldstar website, which I highly recommend. The tickets were $30 each including fees for the VIP admission, which includes skipping the line and a drink at the Baby Dolls Lounge. DEFINITELY DO THIS. It's $60 for VIP if you buy it at the door so def get your tickets online at Goldstar first if you can!!

The maze itself is super rad. It's about the Delmont Hotel's f**ked up residents. I don't wanna give too much away, but if you are a fan of Hostel you'll be very pleased. And if you are a bit of a scaredy cat being dragged against your will into this scary ass maze by your friend or significant other, it's helpful to know that they do have a safe word (well, technically safe phrase-- Red Red Red!) so in case you flip out TOO much or something you'll be okay. But please don't flip out because it is so awesome you should not miss it. 

The best thing about this place is the group size-- seven people or less. If you have been to anything like Universal's Halloween Horror Nights, haunted mazes are usually pretty crowded and you usually see people ahead of you in line getting scares so you're not as scared. Not so at the Goretorium!! We, luckily, had another couple with us who were super sweet and we all joined together to trek through the maze as a unit!! (Only four of us total!) It's super fun and pretty damn scary. Be ready for some good spooks. But pay attention because some of the tricks in each room and absolutely amazing! Very theatrical and entertaining. It took us about fifteen or twenty minutes to go through it.

At the end of the maze, you're spit out into the Baby Dolls Lounge. The night we went was a Tuesday and for some reason all the groups who left the maze after us walked right by the door and left. DEAR GOD WHY!!?!? Drinks are pricey at $15 a pop but they are delicious and strong, so I think they are worth it. Even if you're not a drinker you should stop by and look out over the strip because it's got a killer (yuk yuk) view of the strip. I tried Eli Roth's Blood cocktail and my boyfriend got the Death Tea. I'd recommend both. 

PLEASE GO TO THE GORETORIUM!! I really want this place to stay in business so I can go back on my next trip to Vegas. We had an amazing night so I hope you all have a great time there too!!

P.S. The yard-long drinks are the strongest on the strip! Look for the guys handing out cards-- we got 2-for-1 yard-longs at $20 flat for two drinks including the souvenir cups. The one with everclear in it is strong as f**k. 

Happy Haunting! ;)",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Who doesn't want to get a thrill BEFORE Halloween?! We did and it was well worth the money spent!

Admission line: None! We went right at 11:15PM on a weekday and it was quick and easy. We got the military discount price and was directed to be in line by 11:45 which was the last tour. Tour is open until midnight. 

Event wait line: We had 3 groups in-front of us and we all stood there admiring the gory pictures on the wall as well as the life-sized creepy looking mannequins. Not crowded at all which is a huge plus!

Main event: In my opinion, it was way too short. The actors were amazing and scary and so were the rooms. The actors would pop out of nowhere and give you a good scare! It was a bit too dark to see what's in front of you and because of this, I ran right into one of the guys hand in my group with my teeth when I was screaming/rapidly walking away from an actor with the chainsaw. I'm not going to give anything away but the highlight of the entire tour was probably the first two rooms. The rest will make you jump and scream a bit but the tour ended abruptly. =(

Store/Photos: The store had nice shirts, tank tops, mugs, cups, and everything you would typically find after an attraction but with a touch of blood. Our photos that was taken right at the beginning was rushed. I didn't even get a chance to turn around to look at the camera before the air came blasting in my mouth; literarily. So our photos didn't capture my face/reaction, it did capture the props covering my head and torso. If the photo showed my face, it would have been an instant buy.

Overall: Entertaining, scary, theatrical, gory, and dark. I wouldn't change anything except the way photos were taken only because I'm one of those people who love to buy those souvenirs pics. The rooms and actors are nothing that I've seen/experienced before and that is what makes this Goretorium awesome.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I had been curious about this Las Vegas attraction since it opened last year.  It is on the Las Vegas Strip inside the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood.  It opens at 5pm and closes at midnight or 1am depending on the day.  Myself and my husband considered being scared out of our wits to be a pleasant pre-dinner experience so we got there around 6pm.  There were no lines and we went through the experience just the two of us.

The reason why I had not been to this attraction earlier is frankly because I am a scaredy-cat.  I had been through the attraction's gift shop previously and that had been quite enough for my delicate disposition.  Anyway, what finally convinced me to go was a Groupon, I can't resist a bargain and whilst a $30 entrance fee might be quite reasonable for a tourist, the locals just do not pay that sort of price (I believe they do have a reduced fee for locals).

We did not wait in line and we were greeted by a not-at-all-scary young man who explained that we do not touch the actors and they do not touch us and if we freak out there is a safe word and everything will stop.  Telling me this hugely improved my experience.  It allowed me to be scared just the right amount.  I knew I would never be out of control and that nothing too horrible would happen to me.

The story is that we are in a hotel (and casino, it is Vegas, after all) that was owned by crazy, murdering cannibals.  We are told by the excellent actor who greets us that we won't be going down to the blood-soaked basement (so you know straight away that you will) and after that all hell breaks loose.  The element of surprise is what is so fantastic about something like this, so it is not fair to say exactly what happens, but I would say there are around twenty interactions with actors.  I was mostly screaming/laughing/running away, so I cannot be sure, but I think some actors must play several roles.  There are some gory props along the walk, but the real stars are these people jumping out at you and growling in your face (no, really, it is fun).

As fabulous as it was to experience this with just my husband, I would love to be a fly on the wall for an hour or so in this place, to see other people's reactions.  You can interact with the actors, although many of them are not too coherent since they are playing torture victims, ghouls, chainsaw-wielding nutters and so on.  Acting on stage is one thing but to act right up close to members of the public and stay in character is really quite impressive and that is what makes this place so unique.  

I have never been in a place like this in the US, but I have been to the London Dungeon, where I queued for more than an hour, to be shuffled through a more theatrical-feeling attraction with a huge group of people.  This was way more fun than that.  About halfway through it started to feel like a bit much and I wanted to pause the excitement for a moment have a nice sit down and a drink, but it is relentless, and you do not get a rest until the very end.  The ultimate exit is through the gift shop, as tradition dictates, but this is Vegas, so first you must exit through the bar.  We were done before 7pm so I think it must have been happy hour, so my husband got a beer for $3, pretty good for the Strip with a lovely outside view, which you usually have to pay premium prices for.

I am truly amazed at how much fun this was, I am a total wimp and I thought there was a very real danger of me wetting myself, but they somehow manage to hit just the right level of scary-fun.  These people are hugely talented and entertaining and I even learnt something about myself there; I would be utterly useless in a zombie apocalypse situation.  When the creepy murderers attacked us, I mostly just pushed my husband in front of me and cowered behind him.",4
Arts & Entertainment,Some people don't really like it but who cares I had fun lol,5
Arts & Entertainment,"I was excited when I heard of the Goretorium. A ""haunted house"" on the strip, was too much to pass up so this location shot up to the top of my must see list.

The decorations put me in awe, the jump scares had me laughing, the sets were elaborate, and the participants were dedicated to their roles.

I can't wait to go back with new friends to watch them scream.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I jumped! It was awesome.

Some scary guy jumped out out of nowhere and asked us where I was from.  I lied and said, out of town, and when he asked again, specifically where I was from, I confessed that I had lied and that I was a local.

He called me a ""Lying Vegas Whore"".  It was awesome!!  I've never been so scared and turned on at the same time.

Tip to all locals: Don't try to use you're ""local"" discount.  They have better deals most of the time.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I went here during my recent trip to Las Vegas. I scare easily and wouldn't normally be up for haunted houses. However, we went to Vegas for my BF birthday and he loves those sort of things. I saw the amazing reviews on Yelp and had high hopes for the place. Before we went in they informed us that the staff wouldn't touch us, and that we couldnt touch them. From there I was instantly less frighten. Going through the haunted house it was quick and you could tell that the props were very fake. When I read how much money went into funding the haunted house I was expecting more

.The View at the bar was nice.
I would Just cut through to the bar and enjoy a few drinks and the view and not waste my money going through the haunted house.
All the other haunted house i've been to have been scary then this.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Had a blast!  By and large, I'm cynical of haunted house experiences, insofar as I often find them cheesy.  But, with the encouragement of my travel buddy (and a great discount ticket deal), we decided to check out the Goretorium.

After a slight delay getting there (we had a slightly difficult time finding the location, only because we were expecting a stand-alone building), we picked up our tickets and stood in line.  The experience from beginning to end was so much fun!  I admit, I screamed and jumped and got my share of thrills.  The acting was tremendous, the atmosphere was spooky, and I appreciated the little humor ingested (pun intended?)  into the presentation.

My only overall complaint was that we were forced to group with a father with his 8 year old daughter, and she was a distraction to the overall experience.  We were stopped because she touched one of the actors (because she was scared - the show clearly states 13+, and she was not prepared for the show), and then she defiantly tried to talk back to one of the actors - I have to give props for the nice improv work that the actress did.

Worth your money - go see it!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"It all started with FREE comedy show tickets. We were late. No seats...So while checking out the hotel and trying to find some sort of reason to be on the Strip in the first place. (We were staying on Fremont) We stumbled upon an ugly sight. The Goretorium. I have heard about it on tv and online, but here it is - The year around Haunted House. Im a horror nut myself, and love a chance to get scared. I'll admit the entry way is a bit lame for Roth and the high budget life; Vegas tries to portray. Inside sets the tone of your adventure, right off the bat. As you wait to gather for the rest of your party to take pictures, you watch old news footage of the hotel of past. Creepy stuff. You enter the hotel lobby.....plenty of gore, hello, ahhh....hmm..that way.....oooh a button.... meh...boo, cool sets - kinda distracting, more stuff. and a stale ending, maybe someone took a day off at the end. Maybe that guy getting arrested outside the exit ruined it. O-well. That baby bar at the end has a great view, check it out - you payed for it.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"As a horror movie enthusiast I had to check this place out. The scenery and decor were great. I only had time for the day tour, which is basically a guided tour through the haunted house without all the special effects and people jumping out at you. Needless to say, it wasn't as thrilling as it would have been while the maze was up and running. I haven't tried their night tour because I already saw what the inside looks like, but I'm sure its a lot of fun when the place is brought to life!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Do yourselves a favor before you buy Tickets at the box office or some other site go to Tix4tonight we got 2 tickets there for $40.00. There are parts of this show that really work and parts that dont.  Some of the props do look very gimmicky, like a previous post said though the actors do a fantastic job.  The story line is meh... but I think over all at $20.00 a ticket its worth it, I wouldn't pay more than that though.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"A fun quick haunted house experience. Certainly not worth the full price entrance but with a prepaid discount (and there are many available if you just search), it was ""just right"". The actors were great, fun, and interactive.  

The baby doll bar that you enter immediately after the tour is over was certainly interesting. Unfortunately, they were getting close to closing and ushered us out which was a little disappointing.

Try and go later in the evening. The baby doll bar is located on the roof and is often closed earlier in the day when the weather is too hot (which seems a little ironic - as that would be when a refreshing drink would be most appreciated )

Still all in all, a quick unique thing to do on the strip.

Definitely get your friends to sit in the electric chair by the front door. They will find it a shocking experience and you will get a great photo.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I was very excited to finally go through this. I'd heard about it through some friends who were local to the area, and they were the ones that took us there. It was interactive and totally entertaining, with quality scares as well as comical moments. We got the human sacrifice, although I've been told they also hold a ""wedding"" sometimes as well in one room. And I'll be honest, our picture looks hilarious. Everyone in our group got scared and it was definitely obvious in the photo!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"ehhh.... I really wanted to like this place.  If you feel you have to check it out...definitely find discounted tickets online.  We did this, but were really disappointed to find the BAR closed!!! after we walked through, and paid for drinks that we never got.... so ask the hours, we were not informed... I did not find the ""haunted house"" frighting...and I scare easily.... some of the decor is pretty cool though.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"What a fun time! We went at about 11 at night after a few drinks and it was a lot of fun.  This is a very unique experience to have on the Vegas strip. This isn't the best haunted house I have ever been in, but I did shriek a few times. I am not one that usually gets easily scared but its a fun way to spend some time and get some awesome pictures. Go to Tix 4 Tonight for tickets for about $20pp. Make sure to sit in the electric chair!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Best Haunted House I have been to.

   The Goretorium is an awesome experience, one that you probably didn't think you would do while in Vegas. I was lucky to be there in October of '12 during its first months opening, and let me tell you that it did not disappoint. 

   The Goretorium definitely brings Eli Roths visions to life, almost a first hand experience through his mind. The production value of this place is amazing, from beginning to end. No spoilers here, but the acting was also done very well from all the people working there. Since this is something you have to see for yourself and without spoiling anything, all I can say is that this is for sure a place to get your bells rung and get a good laugh out of it as well. The only downfall is that it might seem a little short, but like I said, the production value makes up for it by a mile. Worth the trip, but please please please, I can't stress it enough, DO NOT bring the kiddos, this is not meant for them in any way. FOR ADULTS ONLY due to the nature and language of this Haunted House.

Go Check it out, worth the see!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Had a blast, short but fun, get your tickets at tickets4tonight booth for ~50% off.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I actually met Eli a few weeks before this exhibit opened in Sept. 2012, & told him how excited I was about it.  Last year I was in LV a month before the exhibit opened, so I was so glad to have the opportunity to go through on my most recent visit a few weeks ago. 

Pros:
* Afraid it would be too scary, my so-called ""horror movie-loving"" friend chickened out.  This I consider a pro because going through solo, I wound up being at the tail end of the group.  This meant I was the target of the actors in every scenario as we moved through the exhibit!
* I absolutely loved that the actors got so close that I could feel their breath on my neck, & they said creepy things in my ear to scare me.  I giggled my way through as I engaged with the actors in a way that other participants didn't have the opportunity to do.

Cons:
* The decor is pretty good but there isn't enough time to take in all the details.
* I was disappointed that Bloody Mary wasn't working the day I went through.  I hear she'd been absent for a few months & had returned, but unfortunately she wasn't working during my visit.

Considering this attraction?  Based on my experience I have some recommendations:
* Since it's relatively short, in my opinion a discounted standard admission ticket is sufficient to enjoy this attraction. 
* Actors can't touch you (or vice versa), which should help persuade friends who are ambivalent to join you.
* If you really want to scare the pants off of a 'fraidy cat friend, see that they get stuck at the back of the group, hehehe
* If you visit in the summer, go at night so that you can experience Baby Dolls Lounge overlooking the Strip without being fried like a vampire in the sun.  It was hot as Hades that day so I didn't experience the Lounge.  (I wasn't alone.  The entire week I was in LV I didn't see anyone sitting out there during the day.)
* I was in the first group to go through on a Sunday afternoon.  Luckily there weren't any kids in the group because I'm certain that if they had it would've ruined it for me; you do run this risk if you go through during the day.  (Parents brought young kids on the TMZ Hollywood Tour & it wasn't long before I had murder on my mind...)

Do check out Goretorium!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I went when it first opened and thought it was pretty lame. I was very excited about it and expected more. My friends had not been yet so I gave it another chance tonight. It's still just as cheesy as the first time and you can tell everything is fake but it was fun with our group of 7 after drinks. :-) Definitely not worth the full price or the locals discount. We found an offer at vegas4locals.com which made each ticket $17. That's a fair price for the 15-minute ""scare.""",2
Arts & Entertainment,I wish I had a camera of my face throughout the whole house....I was scared... I went with 2 of my girlfriends and I held on to them tight the whole way through and prayed for it to be over BUT...when it was over I LOL cause it was sooo fun. Def worth the money use a coupon don't pay full price.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"If you enjoy a good haunted house and are over the age of 12, skip this snooze fest. Very boring, its a short walk through and the lack of creativity is astounding. You know when a haunted house starts out with the old elevator trick, you're in for a ho hum experience. Then again, this review is coming from a person that loves horror movies and haunted houses that has high expectations. I figured since it was on the Vegas strip it would be high production, high budget scares, not so much.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"This is a haunted house, not a museum.  You follow the path and walk through, when you get to the end, then your done.... if you make it.

This is a very well put together horror trek.  There is a neat story to go along with the venue and the experience.  The workers take their job very seriously and put in alot of effort to make it authentic.  You can tell they try hard.  It is a bit much for a haunted house, but its one of the few that go year round.  I would suggest it as a great filler event since you can go through at any time.  Great to KILL some time... ;)",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I really liked the history behind this place, but wasn't very scary. The guide is the one that scares you by pushing buttons or physically jumping behind you. He really focused on scaring the girls in front of us, so that was entertaining. But, I also felt like we missed out on the experience ourselves because of that. 

If you're in the area and have 30-45 minutes to spare, it's good entertainment. I wouldn't say it is a must do/see in Las Vegas.",3
Arts & Entertainment,this place is cool. something different to do in vegas. dont pay full price since deals are everywhere for it. the bar upstairs has the best view of vegas ive seen yet. their drinks up there are horrid. super sweet. if they were better we would have stuck around longer since the view is downright amazing. its def worth going to though,4
Arts & Entertainment,"more like BOREtorium.  I'm actually giving this place 2.5 stars because I really haven't ""experienced better"", but found it very disappointing. And I don't like all those gorey horror movies. I never watched ""Hostel"" either. I was honestly expecting so much more - like I was going to pee my pants or barf!

The set up reminded me of the Hollywood Tower of Terror, which is such a better experience than this place.

First, they take your picture in front of some hotel props and right before the picture, this mechanism makes some of the props fly up with a gust of air. It's supposed to make you have a scared reaction in the pic, but I just had a dumb confused look on my face while my BF was all smiles. 

My BF and I went in with a group of 3 other people who were all together and they were walking in front of us so they got all the people jumping out at them and fake blood dripped on them first so we kinda knew what was coming.

The only scary part was in the the little chapel thing where there were ""people"" sitting at the pews and I was totally expecting one or more of them to jump up and scare one of us - but they didn't.

The ending sucked - you walk through this tunnel thing that is a thin vinyl material on both sides that has air puffing them up and then you're outside at the bar. 

Huh? 

My BF and I were recently talking about it and he called it ""the vagina"". LOL which I guess if you go in the day time like we did seemed like we were coming out of the birth canal since it goes from super dark to a light at the end of the tunnel! 

ps: they kept emphasizing how the characters can't/won't touch us and we couldn't either...which leads me to believe one too many drunk tough guys (or girls) got too touchy there.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"I am a huge horror fan and haunted house enthusiast and have been going to Knotts Scary Farm and Universal's Halloween Horror Nights forever so I was ""hoping"" to get more of a professional film production like sets especially coming from the mind of Eli Roth, a film director himself, but unfortunately I did feel let down, not completely but somewhat, let me explain. 

Without giving up any spoilers or at least leaving them to a minimum let me say this, the first 5 minutes of this experience is easily the best. Definitely a couple of possible scare opportunities during this beginning period but the rest of the haunted house for me lacked on both scares and thematic elements. In one instance one of the scare actors was caught not in her position and tried to recover but after seeing her flee across us when she did eventually jump out it was clearly expected and not scary, more comical due to her not being ready which really there should be no excuse for. Here's why. They only take small groups up (upstairs) in maybe groups of 3-7 or 8 at most. In total I saw 8 maybe 9 scare actors. I think there could have easily been 15 at least. Like I said the beginning was the best and just as authentic and even a little more than what you see at Universal or Knotts in that sense but it was short lived, the actor who tells the history while waiting for the elevator was amazing, truly authentic and creepy - but not sure if he is a regular staple there or if we just caught a good scare actor on that night. The rest of the Haunted House became more comical and not scary to this horror fan and I would not suggest spending full price at all, get it at the Half Price Ticket Booths for sure. One other thing, we went on a slow night, not that many people and still waited 20 minutes, if you plan to go around Halloween and it is a busy night (Fri-Sun) good luck, I can see waiting at least 2+ hours for this due to them taking only small groups up at a time. 

In closing, the view from the strip at the Baby Doll Lounge after you exit the maze is spectacular! Didn't have any food or drinks but the view was amazing, still I felt let down with this Haunted attraction but I'm glad I experienced it none the less.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"LOVED THIS!!!  I'm a fan of Eli Roth and the horror genre, so this was right up my alley.  The best way to describe this, is to say it's similar to a haunted house tour.  We went on the tour before the ""actors"" came on, and it was just fun to hear the story behind the Delmont Hotel.

Our tour guide was great, and made me feel like he was part of the ""Hostel"" crowd.  I will go back when the ""actors"" are there the next time we go to Vegas.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"This place was amazing. My cousin and I had such a great time! The house freaked us out!! However, the complaint I have to make is regarding a couple people who work there. Because we were the last ones to go through it, I felt as though they were rushing us to leave. One of the scare actors said ""are you going to let me talk or what"". Obviously, my cousin and I were screaming and we were scared and I guess we were disrupting her lines that she had to say to us. Then when we were checking out the picture that was taken we were laughing and deciding if we should get it or not and the girl at the register said "" are you going to buy it or not?"" That made us decide to not purchase it at all. We walked out and couldn't believe both of those people's attitudes. Just plain rude.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"This was a lot of fun. I'm a horror movie fan and along with my brother and sister-in-law, we were really excited. We scored a 50% off coupon at the entrance spending $16 per person to get in. The horror props are so much fun to look at in the lobby as well as through the attraction. I absolutely loved the hotel lobby once you were inside with the guide. The elevator was really neat, too. Only the 3 of us went through so plenty of scares for us. I'm a screamer so I think they got what they wanted out of me, lol. At the end is a gift shop for lots of fun stuff, too. A must stop for something different on the strip!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"After spending $90 for my family to be scared out of their minds. I was the only one scared that I just spent that much money in 15 minutes.

Props were great! Characters were okay but not too scary. 

The best money I spent was on drinks at the end. Maybe I should have drank before I went in???? 

Keep your money and go see something else. Thumbs down for me.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"After being reassured that their bankruptcy wouldn't effect them being open on our wedding day, and after taking $1300, we got word today that as of Oct 2nd the Goretorium will be CLOSED PERMANENTLY! We paid for our wedding which is only 4 weeks away and now we may not get our money back. There aren't words to describe how disappointed we are. We've been planning this for a year and now we have a few short weeks to find another place.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"bad news since the goretorium is closing tomorrow, the good news is it's coming back in some other form, i always said the ""story"" of the goretorium would make a iinsane movie experence",5
Arts & Entertainment,"they finally met thier demise. at the end they charged 10.00 for the haunt and 2.00 for drinks. seems like when they were in business they priced them selves out of business. and the way they treated people is another story. guests and employees alike were treated like they didn't matter. as for reopening or anything linked to goretorium, i don't think after the thorn they put in peoples craw, will be successfull. especially the venders who didn't get paid for thier contributions will not get involved. i'm sure the word got around to other venders as well. 
just think, all the venders who supplied goretorium who didn't get paid for services rendered, effects thier bottom line and pay thier employees who inturn have a family to support. 
thanks to robert fry, all those people lose while he probably profited.",1
Arts & Entertainment,Bought groupon tickets.  Called to get directions.  Recording made no mention of being closed.  Drove all the way there only to find it closed down a month ago!  Disappointed?  Yes.  Aggravated?  Definitely.,1
Arts & Entertainment,"This was fun, but not as long as I thought it would be.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"We went here in september and it was all kinds of fun! Really had a great time, it was short but it was scary as hell and the actors were really creepy. Maybe it's just because we scare easily but me and my wife had the time of our lifes here. Add a semi-expensive cocktail and the beginning of our vegas night out was a succes!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Haunted houses aren't really my thing but this had so much hype and then there was a $17 Groupon so I decided to check it out...
It's located in the shopping mall that is across from the Cosmo so parking could be difficult, but we just paid $5 to park at Harley Davidson and walked over the bridge, it was very easy. The entrance and ticket booth is right inside the mall on the middle level, if you are on the pedestrian bridge, it is on that level.

It was very easy to get our tickets as it wasn't very crowded since it was a Sunday so that was nice.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Too bad this place has closed down! Other people are complaining that this place wasn't scary enough, but it was way scarier than any other haunted house I've ever been to. I was screaming the entire time and that's never happened to me before. I was (or wasn't) looking forward to checking it out Halloween weekend! RIP Goretorium.",5
Public Services & Government,"After years of dealing with USPS in Chicago, Champaign is like a breath of fresh air.  I have been to the post office on Green a few times, and each visit has been a positive experience (well, as positive as mailing parcels can be).  The people at the counter have been able to help me and they have been very nice. My only gripe is that they could use more employees working the counter when it gets busy.",4
Public Services & Government,Sometimes have a long line but staff are very helpful,4
Public Services & Government,"I like this office - workers are very polite. 
English is my second language and I've never did some things like money order, for example, but those two nice women wich are working there were so patient and pleasant.
If I need to use USPS servises I always go to this post office although I have another one close to my place.",5
Public Services & Government,"One member of the staff is a bitch to the fifth. But she's mostly justified in being so. If you don't provoke her, she's a very neutral, efficient person. The other member, with whom I've interacted with the most, is not friendly but is very helpful and has the patience of a saint. She is a post office seraph.",4
Public Services & Government,One of the stuff around sixty is such an asshole. I got one emergency package and I really need to mail it. The store close at 3:00 and I got there at 2:55. She just said no time for you and let me out. Totally a bitch.,1
Public Services & Government,"So my brother is on parole and yes I live with him and my mother and father. (currently) 
I went to tell the officer of my brother that he was using again. 
She said she would take care of it later this week. I also ask her to conceal who tipped her off. 
She did. The next day she gets there and maintained that she checked in on him by her own accord. That's good too.

Before I get into the rest of this review I should probably explain that its not entirely the officers fault. Its the system that has a large part in why I am giving this a pending review of 2 stars. I will update it in the months to come.
Also, when you are on Parole, (AKA released from prison early and have to be supervised/checked in and checked up on) They tell you that one slip up could land you in prison. So much as jay walking can land you back in prison. 

So, she asked him if he was using any illegal substances. He admitted that he was.
She searched him and found paraphernalia. She established stricter rules for him and made check ins mandatory for him. Her last order of business was to take a urine sample so she could be clear on what he was using. 
My brother tampered with it by watering it down. 
She clearly noticed that it was tampered with. Yet she did not arrest him.
Though she did say that if he fails 2 more drug tests that he will go back to prison.

So there's a complex system that clearly isn't working and there are some people who try to make things right and make it work. 
Effort was done to uphold this condition but, it was clearly not satisfactory and as of right now it seems like mostly hot air.",2
Public Services & Government,"So its time to update this.
The threats came to something I was surprised to see that they would actually talk to me, listen and do what they said they would do.  Albeit they were leneit and not really rushing to serve punishment.
It may have taken some time, it may have taken some effort on my part. 
but, they got it done. I've heard stories from other people that Parole is a joke and a scam to get you into christian rehabs programs. 

My brother really messed up by taking heroin again and writing letters to inmates still in prison. 

So, for those of you out there that live with someone on parole. You can rely on the parole and probation board to listen to you and take appropriate action. (in due time)

For those of you on Parole. They may not be as strict as they originally tell you but, they will make good on their conditions if you screw up enough. They do give you a chance. First. Don't screw it up.",4
Public Services & Government,This place is stupid .. Why have an apt time ? No matter what your gonna wait forever. Fuk them all,1
Public Services & Government,"Screw this place. Screw the fees. screw the staff. y'all can lick my fabulous crime committing criminal ass. Y'all damn well know no one likes you.

Arts & Entertainment,"Whenever I visit Las Vegas, I always stop by the Forum Shops to watch the Fall of Atlantis show and the best part about this showis it's FREE! The show is located in the far end of the Forum Shops with the huge fish tank and video screens around the top part of the walls. It's near Cheesecake Factory and Abercrombie & Fitch and it can get very crowded with tourists and visitors holding their cameras and kids running around waiting for the show to start. They have security around the fountains to prevent anyone from jumping in the water while the show is playing.

The performers are not real people but are electronic statues that move like real people and look somewhat realistic. A lot of fire and water is used for special effects and has a great storyline about jealousy and having control that led to the destruction of this fabled city.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Yay! Free show in Vegas! Kinda? :/ We randomly stumbled upon this show while checking out the Caesar's Palace. Its located at the end of ""The Forum Shops"" between the Nike store and The Cheesecake Factory. Its basically a large fountain with rocks and foliage. 

Luckily, my wife and I were there about fifteen minutes early and was able to be right up front.  This was a good idea, because it got packed really quick. 

The show starts when these animatronic ""Atlantians"" come out from the rocks and narrate a story about the fall of Atlantis. Honestly, the volume was really low. I'm not sure if that was a technical glitch, but I could barely hear the story, let alone, understand it. From what I could glean from the poor acoustics, a sister and brother were fighting for the rights of the kingdom of Atlantis, which led to its eventual doom. The brother had a cool sword that actually lit on fire. Other than that, this show wasn't really worth watching. I gave it three stars, since I can't really complain too much since it was free.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Fall of Atlantis? More like FAIL of Atlantis. 

As much as I wanna say good things about this ""free show"" my heart tells me I gotta tell the truth. Ever since I have seen this show for the first time a while back, I was never impressed. Nothing has changed since its inception. If the outdated animatronics don't give it away, the voice sounds of the three characters are not only not loud enough, but it's not very clear. Dude, their mouths don't even move! Every time I have friends and family that want to see it that hasn't seen it in town, I have to go through the agony of standing there waiting for this cheesy event to get done.

For those that havnt seen this yet and are thinking about checking it out, let me tell you what its all about so you won't be standing there trying to figure out what the hell they are saying.

So the story goes that this ""king"" of Atlantis has a dilemma with who to give up his throne to. You got his daughter who what looks like she has special powers with water. Then you got his son who has special powers with fire. With the greedy fight for power, a higher presence in the form of a dragon comes out of nowhere and states that nobody is worthy of the throne so he buries the City of Atlantis under water.

So overall, there is not much that impresses you. Even if you have kids the only things that might impress them are the nice fish in the aquarium and that's not even part of the show! There's various water that shoots out in different spots. To me the most impressive thing if that is all sorts of fire that comes out of the woodwork. Ok bad choice of words. Lol.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I went to see this with my nephews since we were at the shops. 

I feel like I must be deaf or what, but I just can't hear some of the dialogue. From what I gather the King is trying to figure out who the throne goes to between his son or his daughter. I didn't hear their arguments and then this dragon comes out  of no where and was like ""Fuck what you just heard"" and no one got the throne.  I didn't know that until I asked what just happened and my nephew was able to keep up with the story to explain no one was worthy.

The kids like the water and fire, so I guess it did the job. The part of this area that was more entertaining was the aquarium attached to the fountain/stage. We spent more time talking about the fish than the show.  

I did not catch the times it is on but I believe it is top of the hour for the duration of the mall being open. Yes, it is FREE, but not worth the special trip to go see. I guess if you're in the building, you can decide if you have the minutes to spare for it and then stay for the little, but nice aquarium.

 In fact the aquarium have divers feed the fish at 1:15 and 5:15 p.m. You can even take a complimentary below-the-scenes guided tour of the aquarium staff facilities Monday through Friday at 3:15 p.m. I have seen the divers feed the fish, which is pretty cool. I have not caught a guided tour to see what that entails. 

 I think the animatronics are tired because they're mumbling so maybe they need to retire.

Arts & Entertainment,"Ok, so this was kind of a cheesy performance, and the audio could be a bit difficult to hear. However, this was a fire and water show telling a story that was on display for free in the middle of a shopping mall! The effects were pretty cool. Water shooting out, flames bursting forth, a battle of siblings for the throne of Atlantis. If I'd paid for this experience perhaps I'd be a bit let down, but if you're in the mall and have 10 minutes to spare, I'd certainly recommend a stop by to check it out!",3
Arts & Entertainment,"It's nice that this is free I guess but there'd be a riot if they charged for it. We were already here for the mall so we decided to stop by, and we didn't stay longer than a minute. Something about the audio in this show makes it both booming loud and completely incomprehensible. It sounds like they were eating mashed potatoes while recording the voices. I could see this being fun for a bored kid at the mall but otherwise avoid.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Yes, it is free, but don't waste your time.
If you have been in Disney or Universal Studios this is ridiculous awful.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"This Fall of Atlantis show in Caesar's Palace (conveniently located next to The Cheesecake Factory and Fat Tuesdays) is laughably bad.

Is it the B-movie style roll on the TV screens? The muffled sound? The janky animatronic movements? Yes.

But you know what it also is? Free.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"The bad reviews puzzle me. This is a *free* show set inside the spectacular Caesar's Palace Forum Shops.

No, I wouldn't pay $30 for it. No, it's not as great as Disney or Universal Studios as one rocket scientist reviewer noted (are those free?). But it's a free 8 minute show. You waste more than 8 minutes watching commercials during a typical 30 minute brain-numbing sitcom.

It's not a ""let's set aside a day to check out"" attraction, but it is a ""We're already here so let's spend 8 minutes watching this free show"" attraction.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"You want some bread to go with that cheese?

I'm immediately reminded of Chuck E.  Cheese, The Country Bears etc.

Cheap animatronics with some fire & water thrown in for spectacle, Fall of Atlantis is a free attraction located in the Forum Shops of Caesar's Palace.  King Atlas has to decide upon who his replacement should be to the  throne, his daughter who has special water effects, or his son who contributes the pyrotechnics.  Gods itervene & have some choice words for King Atlas & his offspring.  The climax brings about a dragon who lays the smackdown on all the Atlanteans & lays waste to Atlantis
http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/caesars-atlantis-fountain/

I know it's free, but I feel like the Fall of Atlantis cheapens the ""baller"" atmosphere of Caesar's Forum Shops.  I mean, with Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Louis Vuitton and Ferragamo attracting the rich clientele, you'd think there would be something more worthy of the demographic?  To me, the best part of the Fall of Atlantis is the large aquarium, with rays, puffers and other assorted marine creatures.  Of course, I grew up on Jacques Cousteau, so I'll always be partial to the sea ;p

Fall of Atlantis shows at the top of the hour, every hour, starting at 11am.  

I suppose if you were slurring your speech & crap-faced drunk, this show would be more entertaining.  All in all, I say let the tourists watch this lame spectacle of out-dated robotics & head over to something more worthy of your time, like the Bellagio fountains or one of the buffets.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"The first time I walked through The Forum Shops, the lights dimmed and a storm brewed overhead.  Was this a sign of impending monetary doom?  All those high end boutiques...  Is that fire?  IT'S THE RAPTURE!  Oh, never mind, a show was going on.  Let's just stand outside all these fancy shops and piss off the store managers.

There was fire, smoke, and fancy water effects.  The domed ceilings of The Forum Shops by all mean should have helped with the acoustics and ambiance but somehow, I couldn't understand what they were saying.  I didn't even know they were telling the story!  

The animatronics aren't exactly Disney smooth or seamless and it's annoying when you just want to shop and people are just standing around blocking the passageways.  It's free and there's fire and water effects at the least.  If you're in the area, by all means do come see it.  Would I recommend anyone making a special detour just to watch it?  Nah.  You'll live without seeing this show.",3
Arts & Entertainment,Pretty lame. It's ok if you're nearby and have nothing to do with 10 minutes to kill. I could hardly hear the dialogue.,2
Arts & Entertainment,"The show plays every hour from 11:00AM to 11:00PM. The show is surrounded by stores and looks amazing. There is fire, water and loud explosions. There are several large screens on the top floor that play during the show adding videos of Titans talking back and forth.  It's very entertaining and I would recommend stopping by if your shopping in the area.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"This is a FREE show inside the Forum Shops.  They play it about once an hour.  By far it is not something you should go out of your way to see, but if you are shopping and wander by, it's worth a few minutes to watch it.  Basically, just fire, smoke, water, loud music, and changing lights.  It might amaze children, so if you have them, it's a FREE show.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"what a waste of time bringing my fam here to show them this, out of all things vegas :-p ...caesars' animatronic shows has alwaz been weak (they previously had a diff bacchus show as i recall)...this Fall of Atlantis fountain show consists of 3 barely-moving 9ft statues...roman King Atlas w/ daughter (water effects) & son (fire) fighting over who will be heir to the throne...can't really make out what they're supposedly saying...& they barely move... b o r i n g, skip this!...it is so pathetic, but hell, it's a free 7min show...at the top of ea hr sun-thu 11a-11p, fri-sat 11a-midnight...which is the hr aftr the shops r opened...west end of the mall under a big dome...

ok to chk out if you're already there, but don't go out of your way! (prob interesting to kids, ages ~5-10?)... it may be even better to jus look at it when the show is not occurring when it's a normal fountain w/ other roman statues...""when the show begins, [those] sink down into the fountain & the throne of Atlas rises""...

do go to that wing for the 50,000 gal circular aquarium...sting rays & ""300+"" saltwater fishes to see...we caught a scuba diver in there feeding them this time...

my review on the Forum Shops in general is here: www.yelp.com/biz/the-forum-shops-las-vegas?hrid=M44fgnT3SbwBvKUSgBSbIQ",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Last show for Sunday should be 11 o'clock we get here around 10:20 PM my kids are very tired but they really wanted to see the show.we waited for 40 minutes guess what ? 11 o'clock comes everybody stand around in front the statues no announcement no preparation no show. I was trying calling Caesar Palace to ask I think higher about the show no one even pick up. I know it is free show,but you got to be credible. shame on you!",1
Arts & Entertainment,"This ""show"" is a piece of crap waste of time. The acoustics are a disaster and you can only understand like one out of every ten words. Seems the daughter wins no matter what the audience applause suggests. I don't think the aquarium fish like the rumbling and noises from the show very much either. And there is a Ray in the tank that is way too large for that size of an enclosure. This is a dead end in the forum shops in more ways than one.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"My last review I specifically said this was more like ""Fail of Atlantis"". Apparently they read my review because they actually redid this attraction. I said the animatronics were outdated and their lips don't even move. After watching it again since the renovation, I have good news and bad news.

The good news is that the animatronics look much better in terms of it being smoother and their lips actually move when they talk.

Unfortunately, that's it. The bad news is that when the characters talk, you STIIL can barely understand what the heck they are saying. As I was watching the show with my family, people all around me were saying what? What did they say?

Bottom line is, they only made it a little bit better. I guess they didn't read my whole review? Ok, then when you guys read this and I hope all the way to the end, make the talking a bit louder and clearer. Put some more speakers down where people stand. Also use all those screens that surround the attraction to your advantage. Put subtitles on there so people can understand what they cant comprehend vocally.

So memo to whoever is in charge of this attraction: TAKE THESE REVIEWS TO HEART. These are people that are giving you their opinion of what they observe. A majority are pretty much saying the same thing. Fix it properly and you will see results. I promise.

Yelp 2015 Review #57 ""The Fail of Atlantis Part 2""
556 overall",2
Arts & Entertainment,"I was embarrassed to have detoured the mall for this. The audio is heavily muffled, and difficult to follow. The script is terrible, with the characters repeating the same dialogue 3 times in an attempt to build the tension. The animatronics are weak, I'm not sure if the water queen was faulty or not but she had very little movement and no effects, whereas the fire dude had fire. The end of the show seemed abrubt, with a dragon getting involved, but not sure what was going on at that stage as the dialogue was too difficult to hear, and we had lost interest anyway.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Fail of Atlantis!!  Do not waste your time! *better spent at the mirage lava show.  Or sitting in a bathroom stall.  Seriously I would rather have sat in a bathroom stall listening to people pop next to me than see this show.  I couldn't understand the robots,  the thing was built with 1970's technology and has never been updated.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I agree whole-heartedly with Jemmie W. below. This show isn't something you necessarily go out of your way for, but it's certainly fun to see if you happen to be there at the right time.  This is an animatronic display that incorporates fire and water into a creative 8-minute show free of charge. That should be refreshing! 

Vegas.com states, ""The costumes and props were created by the same geniuses who worked on Thor and Pirates of the Caribbean and there's also a 20-foot winged dragon. Let's be honest, you just don't see that every day.""

They are excited to scare you and give you a great time to remember! Defiantly come check it out you won't be disappointed! High level scares, actors, Hollywood special effects!

Public Services & Government,"5 days it takes this lethargic water company to turn our water on in our new home in Surprise!  If you do have to deal with their customer service reps, you will see the perfect example of a company with no standards.",1
Public Services & Government,"I had a water leak in and drip system that was never really use at my families rental.  Epcor's records show that we went from being a family using about 9k gallons of water a month to 35k gallons a month.  Our property has no pool and Epcor says they have no way to detect such discrepancies.  Really!!  As a young family being busy and never paying for a water bill quite like this, it took us a few months to notice.  Know that this company does not care about their customer and their service is extremely poor.  They are not willing to help us out in any way.",1
Public Services & Government,"If you have automatic payments, you better check your bank statements! I caught them debiting my checking account twice! When I asked them about it, they knew there was an issue and was working on it. Supposedly I am not the only customer who got charged twice? This is why I cancelled Cox Cable, charging me something with out a notice? Looks like it's time to cancel my automatic payments. 
AGAIN!!!
Check your bank statements!",1
Public Services & Government,I would rather not even give Epcor 1 star they are so outrageously overpriced. If I had any other choice I would never buy water service from them. Our water service is over double the cost of anyone I know and it doesn't include anything but water. No garbage we have to pay separately for that too.  Bad business to rob your customers!,1
Public Services & Government,"I called in a water leak which was coming out of the water meter box, clear full of water, and they said it would take 2 weeks to come out.   After two weeks with no calls and still a water leak I called them and they said they fixed 4 days ago.   I told them that water was still coming out of the top of the water box and they said ""well, we will schedule it again but can't do anything today.   So who knows.  I feel bad for their customer reps because they must just get beat every day.   They charge you $400 a month for water and have crap service, and bitch they need another 35% increase to survive!",1
Public Services & Government,"CHECK YOUR BILL and bank statements! They make false late charges, double charge then blame you. The ledger is completely inaccurate! Customer service is rude when you call to question charges. We had a leak and our bill was 5 times the normal amount. We have been at the same residence for 4 years... at what point would the company recognize a leak? % times the usage is not normal... what a waste of water in the desert... sure do care about their resources...not. But oh no... we are responsible. Worst customer service, (Edward D, they billed me 2x without permission as well) This will be reported to BBB. Looking for input to further audit  and report this company...",1
Public Services & Government,"worst company ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i hate hate hate them. they cant bill, systems suck, and horrific customer service. seriously! i wish we had a choice!!! everyone needs to report their bs! they steal and cheat you out of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! check your bill horrible ledger, inaccurate. learn basic accounting skills you morons! ap/ar .... how about basic subtraction????",1
Public Services & Government,"Worst water Company.

We have mainly rocks in our yards because when we first moved in water bill was $580. Our gardener only comes out 1 a month. Our water bill is generally at $230, by the way if we used 0 water our water bill would start at $140. Our real estate agent knew nothing about the Verrado community water company and how they charge. We had never even thought to ask about water company. If we had known this we would never have purchased a home here. 
For the whole month the valve was broken and no one notified us by calling us. They told us they left a notice on our door and sent a letter neither we received. Our water bill ended up being over $1700. We had the valve fixed for $80. It would have been nice if they would have called us. 
We have listed our home for sale and now we verify wherever we move to does not have Epcor or a private water company listed. This water company is from Canada and just charges whatever it feels like. Very disappointed in this company and Verrado for signing up with them.",1
Public Services & Government,"Not pleased with my service here at all!! They noticed a spike in my water to as their gal put it my water consumption could have filled a few pools. Now mind you this is a vacation home and I do no reside there and no one has been staying there this month. They had some one out at my vacation home on 6/20 and all they did was apparently leave a sticky note on my door to inform me. I understand that they do not realize this is a vacation home but my Pest Control company took the time to call me and inform me that they were seeing something that didn't look right. They discovered for me that my house was flooding yesterday when they were out there. Needless, to say EPCOR could have informed me a week prior there was a serious problem but that would have been too much trouble for them:(

I called them back yesterday upon the discovery to ask why they hadn't reached out to me when they saw such a spike in my water consumption. I did ask for a manager who called me back and left a message and sounded like I was the one putting her out...clearly no big deal that my house flooded because they left me a sticky notice on my door. 

I know they will have no problem taking my money for the increased flooding. 

It's just sad because one quick phone call to me would have alerted me there was an issue.",1
Public Services & Government,"this  outfit is like most = crooks  who hope and pray you get a leak so they can really stick it to you. my water usage doubled in one month yet they said nothing, that is nothing but send me a bill that was double. they said nothing when my meter was reading 3 gallons per minute for over a month. i do believe that all these water actually count on water leaks as part of there income. what a bunch of scum-bags.",1
Public Services & Government,"Now I had a good excuse to go to the mall. I need to go for early voting! 
 
This polling place is located inside the mall on the first level out in front of Kohls. It doesn't matter what precinct you're assigned to, any registered voter can vote here during early vote week. The lines were long but there were plenty of election monitors and the polling place here was well staffed and organized. So it was a relatively a short wait in line.

Everyone that I encountered was pleasant and professional. As I got to the front of the line a polling assistant lead me to one of the election clerks sitting at the tables. Since I took the address label from my voter ballot with me, all they had to do was scan the barcode.  You don't have to bring your sample ballot but it does make the process move faster.  Verification is determined by the signature match on file, birthdate and address. Election clerk did not ask for any ID.  After signature verification, I was handed a plastic card and led to the polling area. From there the poll worker let me know which election monitor is available.
  
The election monitors are touch screen and are activated once you insert the card inside the machine. Think ATM machine...that's how these monitors operate.  These screens were super sensitive I noticed.  Just a slight touch of the screen was all it took.  I followed the easy to read prompts on the monitor, made my choices, watched my ballot get printed and made sure it was all correct then casted my vote. Voila!!  It took about 3 minutes total. Your card ejects and as you exit just hand it to the poll worker collecting it.  Another poll worker handed me my ""I Voted!"" sticker. That's it! Whole process was real easy.",4
Public Services & Government,"Yes! I voted!

   Thanks to the Galleria Mall's Early Voting Center (near Kohl's on level 1), voting was an enjoyable experience. The long line (a good thing because people are voting) went by fast. It seemed that shopping was just as much on people's mind as voting. The line concluded at a table manned by Election workers. Here one of them scanned the booklet they sent me that shows my name, address, and the sample ballet. Subsequently, she gave me a card that I would place into the voting machine and directed me to wait by the American Flag. From the American Flag, I walked to a voting machine, and cast my vote.

  These voting machines are not the dinosaurs of the past. The voting machines of today are easier to use than an ATM Machine. It was as easy as touching a circle, then pressing next. Casting my vote was as easy as pressing ""submit.""

   A couple of things before I conclude this review. I would like to thank Shirley. B for putting this on Yelp, and recommend reading her excellent review. And most of all, ""Your vote counts.""

I used Galleria Mall as my check-in.",4
Public Services & Government,Very efficient voting.... lot's of last minute people there voting and they were moving them throught the process!,5
Public Services & Government,The people was helpful I didnt need drivers licence. It was easy as pie. I was in and out with in seven mins tops :) Yey I Voted woot! Woot!,5
Public Services & Government,"Hurray for Early Voting in Nevada!  

This location generally had long lines--I stopped by the mall a few times during early voting periods and there was generally a line on workdays after 5 pm and most times on the weekends.

Even with the line, this voting site gets five stars for moving the line along fast and having a great staff of  volunteers.  I finally jumped into the line on the last day of early voting and the line was about 100 people deep.  But we moved forward steady, they found my name on the voter roll quickly, and the volunteers were very welcoming.",5
Public Services & Government,"Speed. If you're the type that likes to get in, get out, and get on with your life, the Early Voting Site at the Galleria Mall is a place you'll like. If you've ever voted outside of Nevada, you're REALLY going to like this place. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the entire process from checking your ID to getting your sticker saying I Voted! is a breeze. And the touch screens make it easy to vote, no punch cards or hanging chads tied to the memories of a past Florida presidential election to worry about here. You make your choices, you see it on screen, you see it on the paper print out beside the screen. You leave feeling your vote is secure and it will be accurately counted. It doesn't get any easier than this. 

5 Stars. Because short of being able to vote right from your phone it doesn't get better than this. 

Special Note: I want to say THANKS to Shirley B. for checking in here. I saw her check-in and it reminded me to go vote! 

(Note: The wait for the Presidential Election a few months back was 25 minutes. For the City of Henderson election for Mayor...I was in and out in under 4 minutes. 

Pssst: Colorado? Missouri? Send your Election Officials to Clark County, see how voting is supposed to be!

Public Services & Government,"It only took a few minutes to get my voting done at this location, and there was no line whatsoever. I went during the afternoon and the people working the poll were very friendly! If you go in with your sample ballot prepared, it won't take long at all for you to get it finished. You don't need to have a sample ballot with you but it definitely makes the process go way faster- so I recommend going with the sample ballot if you received it in the mail. You don't need to show I.D. or voter registration card either. Very simple process and quick! I definitely recommend coming to this location to do your voting!",5
Public Services & Government,"I don't get mad. I get even! I don't stay home. I vote! 

  I follow the news. Some elected officials are doing a commendable job. However, some of our elected officials or candidates following them have raised my blood pressure. Today I raised my voice through my vote. I was voting proud and voting early. 

 Voting at the Early Polling Center in the Galleria is as easy as 1, 2, 3. Today when I opened my mailbox, I see the Clark County Elections booklet. The thing was that my left foot was hurting and with urgency I needed to buy sneakers. But should I visit the Las Vegas Outlet Mall or Galleria Mall? Tadah! The the sample election book led me to the Galleria Mall where I'd play a role in my Country's future. I'd park my vehicle by Dillard's then walk a few feet to the Kohl's area. 

 The polls were not crowded today. Immediately the Election staff greeted me. I inquired if I was registered to vote. I did not fill out paperwork this year. I was 100% ready to vote. Elections are truly keeping up with technology. I say this because by scanning the back of my sample ballot booklet, she retrieved my name and address. Quicker than I could walk from the table to Kohl's, she presented me with the conputerized card I'd place in the ballot box, and directed me to a man holding the American flag. He'd direct me to another worker holding the American flag at the ballot box where I'd cast my vote. 

  The times are a changing. Gone is the dull booths where voters pressed these annoying levers. Today it is all computerized and really more in the open. The ballot box has revolutionized to the ballot touch screen. Being a fan of Caveman Keno and the smartphone, voting was fun. Corresponding to each vote was the choice of candidates that a touch on the screen would cast a vote for. Toward the end, it would prompt you to review your votes. You'd touch a submit button prior to making your way toward the poll worker at the exit (by Kohl's) who thanked you for voting and gave you an ""I voted"" pin. 

  Voting is so important. You live once and need commendable leadership under strong and moral leaders. I walked out of here with the feeling that I made my voice known and possibly in one or two instances I joined the majority in telling a couple of candidates, ""Your fired!"" And in a few instances I joined the majority in telling a few candidates, ""Job well done."" The last thing I want to say before I walk out of this review is, ""Every vote counts.""",4
Restaurants,"Je suis aller à ce restaurant seulement pour déjeuner, alors je n'ai pas encore essayer le menu régulier. 
J'ai pris le Glouton, qui regroupe pas mal tous les champs du guide alimentaire canadien, avec beaucoup de viande et je n'ai pas été déçu. Dans une assiette les patates, le bacon, la saucisse, le jambon, les fruits et dans l'autre: Une belle crêpe.
Le tout est au thème du madagascar, mais pour les déjeuners c'est pas mal régulier, sauf pour un chocolat chaud du madagascar qui est très bon!
Je vous conseille d'avoir un manteau chaud, car les propriétaires ne chauffent pas le restaurant, donc vous aller devoir manger avec votre manteau. C'est un restaurant avec maximum 15 places assises, mais le service est pourtant très très long, mais c'est pas cher et le  proprio, qui est le serveur, est aussi très amical.

Restaurants,"I grabbed a quick lunch here on a friend's recommendation and I liked it! The food is Madagascarian at heart, but I guess they do a bunch of other basic brunch things. I just tried the fried noodles with egg which was freshly made, tasty and light. I added a bunch of hot sauce to it when I got the leftovers home, but maybe that's just me. I also tried the 'best ever lemonade' which was full of fresh mint, and not too sweet and really great. I wish places like this would simplify and focus on what they do best and doing it better than everyone - the pieces of paper taped on the window with brunch updates and other menu item deals feel like afterthoughts, and they make me feel sympathy but not excitement. Anyway, who cares, the food is tasty and the service I had was super friendly and nice.",3
Restaurants,"Par rapport a beaucoup d'autres, je trouve que le rapport qualité prix n'y est pas. Mais cette fois ci la qualité est au dessus du prix ! Ca a été pour nous une bien agréable surprise de découvrir cet endroit. Bien qu'il ne paie pas de mine ce restaurant a quasiment tout pour lui.
Prix très abordables pour un brunch certes classique mais vraiment bon. Tout ce qui est servi est fait maison, du pain aux saucisses en passant par le chocolat ou la ""meilleure limonade au monde"".
Certes je n'ai pas goûté a l'essence même de ce restaurant, c'est à dire la cuisine malgache, mais pour le coup j'ai vraiment hâte ! 
Seul bémol le temps du service qui peut être un peu long pour des personnes pressées. Mais leur sourire sait faire pardonner !   : )",4
Restaurants,"Nous sommes arrêtés ce matin complètement par hasard. Nous avons été agréablement surpris. Le brunch était délicieux, un agencement très juste entre la cuisine de Madagascar et de Montréal. Le bagel et le saumon fumé maison étaient parfait. Et la sauce piquante absolument délicieuse! Le service courtois. On y retourne sans hésitation!",5
Restaurants,"Superbe petit restaurant d'inspiration malgache. J'y suis allée pour bruncher un dimanche, c'était relativement vide (sauf la terrasse) et le service était tout de même lent. 

Par contre ! Ils ont vraiment la meilleure limonade du monde (menthe + lime) servie en verre ou en grande bouteille. Les bénédictines au saumon fumé m'ont jeté à terre, de même que les p'tites patates déjeuner, cuites à la poêle. 

À essayer ! TOUT ESSAYER !",4
Local Flavor,"Awesome.  A very livable and navigable city that feels much smaller than 4 million people.  They have a bustling downtown and old city, along with a major park and active arts and nightlife districts.  And it's definitely cleaner than any major American city I've ever been to (although Portland, OR is close).  The predominate language is French, but most Montrealers are bilingual in French and English.  The Metro (subway) is a definite plus.",5
Local Flavor,"This is a crazy city, and I love it more than I can say. Riddled with corruption and perpetual construction, with no ocean for miles, you'd think a place like this might lose it's soul, but instead it made a home for burlesque stars and booze runners during prohibition; fought back against urbanization trends that made parking lots out of other old city centres; made a home for the largest per-capita population of artists anywhere in Canada; fostered and fought for a completely unique bilingual culture; and continues to scrap for affordable education and health care. It's not all good and golden, and I look forward to reading others reviews and stories, but for sure I have at least 5 stars worth of love for Montreal.",5
Local Flavor,"Aaahhh....Montréal! J'adore tes festivals et tes étés fous qui passent bien trop vite. Faire la ligne pour un bon smoke meat, ou bien trouver LA poutine à 3 heures du matin, c'est des classiques dont je ne peux me passer. J'aime moins les nids de poules, la construction à ne plus finir, les ponts et tunnels qui menaces de s'écrouler et les mosus de bouchons de circulation. Au moins, quand je me promène en Bixi le long du canal Lachine, j'oublie tout ça. J'aime aller voir les ratons-laveurs qui sont un peu obèses parce qu'ils sont nourrit par les touristes sur le Mont-Royal. Patiner au Parc Lafontaine, y'a rien de plus romantique. Voir le signe Farine Five Rose flasher à partir de chez-nous, ça me fait sourire. Aller découvrir des nouveaux cafés, restos, bars et boutiques dans des quartiers moins centraux comme Verdun, HoMa, Mile End, Outremont, Rosemont, Villeray et Ahuntsic, y'a rien de comparable. Montréal, je t'aime.",5
Local Flavor,"Montreal. My old home.

As a fellow Yelper wrote, ""This is a crazy city.""  Never has a few words be such an understatement.  Founded by the French hundreds of years ago, conquered by the English, then evolved and grew into a unique creation of it's own, Montreal is the city of culture, of both extreme tolerence and hatred, of quiet moments and bloodthirsty riots, and of the simple joys yet complex as life seen through a kaleidoscope.  

It's a place that's been cosmopolitan for a long as the word has existed.  With it's reverence for the past, the mindset of the people are very much european in mind where the people work to live, where united they possess that joie de vivre that can only come from such a complex birth.  

Walk through the streets. It's alive... even when it's quiet.  The pulse of the city runs through the streets and the alleys, in the lights and the shadows and in the faces of the people old and young alike.  It's a city where corruption is ripe in the highest echelons of life, yet it's safe for a woman to walk across town alone at night.  Montreal is the place where barrels of bootleg whiskey to Al Capone was transformed into higher buildings of art, literature and education.  And it's the place where a people celebrate a victory or a loss in hockey with a riot of monumental proportions, yet can dance peacfully in the streets every summer in the hundreds of thousands.

It's the place as I said, built by the tensions of the 2 solidtudes, english of the west and the french of the east.  Both sides polarized in their love of their culture and their respective nations, whether it be the multicultural Canadian landscape or the uniligual french culture.   While time has slowly merged the two extremes a little closer in the newer generations, the past generations still fight in the war between either or, where the simplist things as posting an english sign could get you fined and charged.  Yet, actions such as hosting one of the world's largest gay and lesbian parties is not only embraced, it's celebrated.  That tension has brought forth a unique creative energy that has given birth to some of the world's finest chefs, writers, artists, dancers and musicians.

As the same aforementioned yelper noted, ""it's not all good and golden"".  Again, it's quite an understatement.  It's a place that is so dedicated to it's socialist ideals, that it's willing to bankrupt itself slowly.  Education is given cheaply, as well as child care, yet the roads are crumbling and the bridges are on the verge of collapse.  Health care is given to all, but done so by underfunding their doctors and nurses.  

As you can see, Montreal is a land of contrasts, but for almost all that have left the isle for new pastures, it's still a place where we expatriots will always hold in our heart as our spiritual home.  Merci Montréal, nous vous aimons.",5
Local Flavor,"Bon, mon point de vue est de toute évidence biaisé, je suis né et j'ai passé la majorité de ma vie ici. Montréal c'est mes vieilles pantoufles, c'est le confort de connaître les rues, les stations de métro et les lignes de bus par coeur. C'est la famille, les amis, les coins que j'aime. C'est aussi les souvenirs à plein nez qui surgissent de tout les recoins.

Parfois, il faut s'éloigner pour se rendre compte de notre chance. La vie a voulu que je quitte Montréal pour 5 ans de 2004 à 2009 et cette épisode ne m'a fait que plus apprécier Montréal. 1 an à Cannes et 4 ans à San Francisco (qui ne sont pourtant pas les pires coins de la planète) ne m'ont permis que de mieux apprécier mon petit patelin natal.

Je me souviens du dernier hiver avant de partir où je déglaçais mon pare-brise après un épisode de verglas en me disant que je ne m'ennuierais jamais de l'hiver...  Eh bien, 5 ans sans hiver m'ont fait changer d'opinion... j'aime les saisons de Montréal! C'est au retour d'un exil de 10 ans à Miami que l'écrivain Dany Laferrière avait écrit ""J'aime l'été à Montréal parce que c'est un été qui a connu l'hiver"" (cité de mémoire). C'est probablement la caractérisation la plus juste des saisons montréalaises. L'été, les gens s'empressent à sortir, à fêter, à profiter de ces précieux moments à chérir qui ne seront bientôt que des souvenirs l'hiver venu. Je n'ai jamais rien vu de tel à San Francisco où les gens ne connaissent pas cet empressement ayant une température plus égale à l'année.

Mais l'hiver aussi à ses charmes en soi. La sonorité que l'on trouve lors des tempêtes de neige, la luminosité des jours ensoleillés qui est accrue par le plancher de neige blanche, le calme de l'hiver glacial quand on est bien au chaud dans nos appartements surchauffés. L'occasion de manger une soupe à l'oignon gratinée et de fêter avec de bons amis.

Je suis une personne du sud de l'île de Montréal et en bon autochtone, je considère que le nord commence à Sherbrooke... évidemment si vous habitez Ahuntsic, St-Michel ou Cartierville,  vous vivez en lointaine banlieue! Je considère cela exotique d'aller vous visiter de temps à autre, mais je ne considèrerais certainement pas votre quartier pour une sortie!

Des sorties occasionnelles un peu plus acceptables peuvent se faire aussi au nord que la petite Italie qui encercle le meilleur marché de Montréal (Marché Jean-Talon), Milano et quelques bons restos et cafés Italiens. C'est aussi le coin d'un petit groupe de restos et d'épiceries asiatiques, surtout vietnamiens, parmi les meilleurs en ville. Je me suis d'ailleurs exilé dans la petite Italie pendant 5 ans au début des année 2000 (1999-2004) et ce fût quand même agréable.

Un peu plus au sud, il y a le ""mile-end"" avec les bagels. C'est presque religieux ici entre les mordus de St-Viateur et ceux de Fairmount (dont je suis) mais il y a une certitude bien montréalaise... il n'y a rien au monde qui s'y comparent. Rien non plus ne se compare à Schwartz un encore plus au sud sur la ""main""... oui, il y a quelques autres prétendants en ville pour le goût de la viande, mais rien ne vaut l'expérience de manger un ""smoke meat"" chez Schwartz!

En terre plus familière, au sud de Sherbrooke, on trouve le centre-ville ou la densité de la foule sur la rue Ste-Catherine nous rappelle Manhattan. On retrouve le Vieux-Montréal, la partie typique et historique d'une des plus vieilles villes du continent américain. Le vieux-port et le quartier des spectacles sont les deux pôles des festivals. Les rues St-Denis et Crescent pour les bars.

Un peu plus à l'ouest et au sud, mon nouveau quartier d'adoption, Pointe St-Charles qui connait un dynamisme et une énergie nouvelle avec le reste du sud-ouest de Montréal. J'adore me balader le long du canal Lachine et découvrir les trésors du coin.

Montréal est d'abord une ville à vivre. Une ville ou on est bien. Elle n'a pas le spectaculaire de San Francisco ni l'énergie de Hong Kong, Tokyo ou Manhattan mais c'est une ville agréable. Ceux qui prennent le temps de s'y arrêter et d'en apprécier le rythme en ressortent accrocs.

Petite particularité... la ville est construite selon un plan cartésien suivant une orientation sud-ouest/nord-est et en conséquence, le ""nord"" usuel est plus vers l'ouest géographique, ce qui donne l'impression que le soleil se couche au nord! Seule endroit au monde comme ça!",5
Local Flavor,"Montreal is a beautiful, but large city that contains quite alot of architecture to look at. During the winter (when I visited), it was VERY cold usually dipping into the single digits (F) to negative temperatures. Their downtown is quite large and contains an ""underground"" city that goes for miles. Above ground there are many sight-seeing attractions that are all within a walking distance of each other, including the Bell Centre, Place des Arts, Complex Desjardins, Notre Dame Basilica, St. Patrick's Church, Chinatown and Old Montreal. I highly recommend taking the Metro to the outskirts of the city as it is very easy to get acclimated to it. They have a small Metro system, but it's clean, efficient and easy to access. I would love to come here in the summer as well when it is warmer, but if you want to experience Montreal for it's well documented cold weather then definitely come here in December-February!",4
Local Flavor,"Can't love this place enough. Remarkably functional for such a corrupt hellhole. If I wanted smooth roads, nice weather, trustworthy landlords, and short ER waits, I'd move to Scottsdale. And you should too, prospective condo-buyers.",5
Local Flavor,I love this city since a child. If you think Boston driving is aggressive. ..try it here.  Many quality chain and boutique hotels around the city. It's a young vibe city with countless places to hang out and meet women. This applies to you ladies as well.,5
Local Flavor,Loved this city.  Extremely bike friendly and the city is just absolutely beautiful.  Definitely one of the top cities I've ever visited.,5
Local Flavor,"What a wonderful city to visit, I can only imagine how amazing this city would be to live in. It is possible to do anything one would wish to do, hiking, biking, sightseeing, etc. The city boasts such a terrific array of cuisines, and all the restaurants we visited while there were amazing. There seems to be a lot of life filling the city, a Sunday drum circle in the park, why not go and bang on a dlembe? Need to get across town but dont want to take the subway or a cab? Grab a rental bike at such an affordable rate and tool around. 

   Want to take in some truly beautiful sights? take a walk to one of the many parks in the city and grab a patch of grass and post up. The museums don't let down either. There are so many things to do here, I can see myself living there and never feeling bored. Even though my hubs and I basically just returned from here we look forward to making a return visit sooner rather than later.",5
Local Flavor,"If you have ever dreamed of visiting the Soviet Union of the 1970s and were disappointed because you didn't have a time machine then you need look no further then Montreal!  A city that is slowly bankrupting itself under the outdated socialism that has become one of its defining characteristics is as close to Stalin era soviet charm as you will find without a Tardis. 
 The crumbling infrastructure, high levels of unemployment and general feeling of malaise that infuses this grey city leaves you with the impression that at any moment a Russian tank could roll down the street past you and no one would even bat an eye.
 Each time I am forced by my wife to visit this city I am reminded of why Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe....because it was depressing.  If you are forced to come to this city for vacation or business(lets be realistic no one would need to go to Montreal for business) then I suggest you swing by city hall. While there you can watch what it would have been like for the citizens of the USSR to have their economy destroyed by incompetent, economically illiterate politicians slowly over many years....or you could visit Vancouver and have fun.",1
Local Flavor,"Hace unos años, programando un viaje a NYC y viendo lo demenciales que son los precios de las habitaciones en Manhattan onda para quedarte allí 2 o 3 semanas, agarré el mapita y me fijé que ciudad aledaña tenia cerca para aprovechar el mejor el viaje. La opción mas lógica hubiese sido Boston pero no me convencía, quería algo mas exótico y a la vez exclusivo.
Agarré Google Maps, chusmee un poco y la elegida fué Montreal. Me asesoré un poco acerca de las características de la ciudad y en pocas horas me convencí: Parte de Canadá lado francés, por ende hablan ese idioma, es una meca de arte y buen comer, relativamente chica, todas las marcas y lo mas importante es que en ese momento tenias el dolar canadiense a $2.8, saliendo una habitación de hotel 4 estrellas 1/4 de lo que me salia cada noche en un hotel berreta de Manhattan.
Fui a la embajada de Canadá y tramité la VISA, que es similar a la de USA aunque por menos duración.

Partiendo en micro desde la NYC Port Authority, el recorrido hasta Montreal dura aproximadamente 8 hs de micro, cruzando todo el magnifico Upstate  New York. Para que te des una idea NYC solo es un punto en el enorme estado de New York. Visitás ciudades como Albany y a medida que te acercás a la frontera las casitas se van haciendo mas suburban con un toque nevado de película onda Mi Pobre Angelito.
Luego de migraciones, que no entendieron bien que hacia una pareja de argentinos haciendo ese tipo de viaje, cruzas a Canadá y al rato arribás a Montreal.

Montreal es una ciudad mágica, indescriptible. La gente se viste bien, es culta, amable, está todo limpio, no existe la delincuencia, es todo lindo, todo perfecto. Como un cuento de hadas. Tenes lugares históricos fusionados con emprendimientos modernos y una oferta gastronómica interminable para todos los bolsillos.

Pero no todo es rosas. Hace frió, mucho frió. El primer día nevaba con -20C y no teníamos la ropa adecuada para la situación. Luego de comer en un Mc Donalds y salir a caminar me dieron ganas de ir al baño fuertemente y les juro que del frío no sentía de la cintura para abajo. Nada. Hacías una cuadra y te tenias que meter a algún lugar a calentarte. Allí fué cuando descubrimos el RESÓ, o la ciudad subterránea como le dicen y será explicada en mi próxima reseña. Pero ese frío no intimida a los canadienses, que me decían que ESO NO ERA FRÍO, que frio era -40 C que es cuando un perro se congela en la calle y no puede salir. No gracias, para mi con que nieve es suficiente!.

Un vez mejor equipado, con todo un arsenal invernal que compré a precios irrisorios y de la mejor marca, continuamos con la exploración. Entre las atracciones se encuentra el Mont Royale, que es un monte hermoso que rodea a la ciudad y lo podes subir y arriba tenes un parador para tomar chocolate caliente. Tiene una vista imponente a toda la ciudad con el rio de fondo, y los locales lo aprovechan para hacer deporte como subirlo corriendo o en bici.
La ciudad está llena de shoppings, espacios de arte y patios de comidas. Su gente adora patinar sobre hielo y ver partidos de ice hockey, el vino, la cerveza y el café, aunque tuve problemas con la carne que como regla general de la vida cuanto mas al norte estás peor es, por el tema del frió y la distancia.

El tema del idioma es complicado. Mas te vale aprenderte algunas cosas básicas de Francés porque a los locales no les agrada hablar en inglés. Algunos lo hacen, sobre todo la gente que viene de Ottawa, pero otros no quieren saber nada por mas que sea un país bilingue.

Como conclusión, en una ciudad que poca gente de acá conoce, lo cual es lógico porque queda realmente lejos de Buenos Aires, pero que disfrute mucho y suelo extrañarla.",5
Local Flavor,"Such a great city to visit! Must try the Poutines, take a walk down in Old Montreal, eat a smoked meat sandwich, visit the underground mall and explore the cobble stone streets. It's a must visit place!",4
Public Services & Government,"Quality of services are outstanding. All staff encounters have been positive, friendly and compassionate. Very professional organized and resourceful. 

I'm appreciate the services and have been to many dr's prior to receiving services. So far they are in the top 5. Things that are important to me are cleanliness, professionalism, organization and compassion.",5
Public Services & Government,"This little clinic still continues to impress me.  I happen to have so many health challenges and have been going to a set a several different specialist. Amongst everyone they have been so professional, organized, polite, and personable. I wish the rest of my care was through them.",5
Public Services & Government,"While visiting family for a family emergency I acquired an infection. I contacted LVPHHS Clinic to see if I could be seen by a physician for an eval and medication. Prior to treatment the clinic needed to verify my native status. I informed them that I'd been to the clinic twenty years prior when I had lived in LV. At that point the clinic went back into the archives and found my records so that all I had to present was an ID to receive service. Once I arrived they had me fill out an updated medical history.Then I was able to see the doc and receive medical treatment. Dr. Nguyen (pron: Win) listened intently and inquired concerning pertinent information. He then had his staff redress the wound with medicated cream and give me an injection of antibiotics w/ a script of oral antibiotics. He also referred me to an advanced wound care facility w/ a follow-up visit in 3 days. Then I was sent to clinics pharmacy to obtain my medication. The main reason for this review is to inform those who don't know about the OUTSTANDING QUALITY OF CARE and EXCEPTIONAL EFFORT that THE STAFF had DONE to get me in for medical  treatment on such short notice. EVERYONE from the reception personal through the records department to the nurses and doctor and followed by the pharmacy staff all DESERVE KUDOS!!!             8-)                        THANKS AGAIN, Jack",5
Public Services & Government,This is the most amazing place I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with.  Everyone is just AWESOME!!!,5
Public Services & Government,"Everyone is nice and welcoming. The doctors office is cleaning. Everyone in the Orthodontics office extremely friendly. Wait time is long and if you have to get prescription, you'll wait longer than 30 mins. But I can't be picky about good health care.",5
Public Services & Government,"This place is great! I've come here with my girl here several times since this is her primary care center. Every employee is very friendly and welcoming. They never say ""I don't know"" or have a hard time answering questions. 

The wait time is typical, but they are usually as punctual as it gets, you're never waiting hours to be taken care of. The office is clean and there is plenty of seating in the lobby. 

As a family member of a patient, I've been very happy with the way they do business and treat people. Definitely a 5-star office.",5
Local Flavor,"Apparently some years ago, a number of people assembled on the steps of a funeral home in the shape of a Christmas Tree and started singing. They are still doing so. Perhaps not the same people, but you get the idea.

Whatever the case, the Singing Christmas Tree is a tradition that is still going strong. Or strongish. There was even a wedding party that has apparently attended the event for 50 years now. But the jury is certainly out on the event itself.

Not having attended this particular performance before, I don't know if this is what they usually do, but they seem to have an identity issue. Notably, some songs are performed in their entirety (and then some), with every verse from the traditional hymnal, with more thrown in as well. Others are abbreviated in American Idol or Glee-esque fashion. It's a mish-mash that doesn't really work that well.

Then throw in works like a tribal drum  number (that was one of the better of the night) and the fact that some of the better voices are muted in the tree itself so you can't hear them, and it's definitely something you might not miss if it doesn't see a 59th  year.

At a minimum, they may be better off doing a traditional show for those who want the regular hymns, and a contemporary one for those who, well, don't, rather than trying to mix the two. And for goodness sake, fix the sound and seating issues, as those are just too basic to not have working correctly!",2
Local Flavor,"This is a tough event to review.  If I could give half stars, I would go with 2.5.

I had never been to a performance of the Singing Christmas tree before, so I was looking forward to checking it out. As Chad mentioned in his review, the show was an odd mixture that included traditional Christmas songs, international Christmas songs, puppets, and dancers. 

The singers making up the tree did sound pretty good for most of the songs they performed and the soloist had a nice voice.  However, there were a few songs that did not get very good treatment. For example, I felt that their performance of Feliz Navidad was watered down and washed out.  It was a disappointment.  Overall though, I would rate the singers a solid 3 stars. 

The dancing was hit or miss. I enjoyed the Irish dancers, but some of the other dances were not my cup of tea. A couple of times, I felt the dances seemed a bit out of place for this type of performance - the rockette style dancing by younger performers seemed a bit odd to me. I would give this portion of the show 2 stars.

I like the Grey Seal Puppets but honestly, the storyline of the polar bear puppet was a bit on the silly side.   The talents of the Grey Seal Puppeteers are much more apparent in their other performances. 

However, the biggest problems I noticed were with the venue itself. I would give the venue 1 star.   First off, when we arrived, there were a lot of seats that had been double-booked.  I have never seen that type of chaos at any type of performance I have been to. It was bizarre.

The acoustics in this venue have always been bad, and they still are. 

Then, the seats were actually uncomfortable and I felt squished into my seat sitting between one big person and one tall person.  I almost felt claustrophobic at times. 

To top it all off, it was really hot in there.... so uncomfortable that we thought about leaving halfway through the show.   We did end up staying for the entire performance but I have to admit, I felt a sense of relief when the show was over.",3
Local Flavor,"What's not to like about this entertaining production? Anyone who enjoys Christmas should attend and feel the joy. With falling snow every now and again on stage, and a wonderful choir that sang in perfect unison while standing on the set of the elaborate tree, it was a glorious evening
I had the good fortune of having a great seat next to a lovely lady whose husband was in the choir along with her dear friend who played the angel. She told me they practice every week starting in September, and then the whole week before the production. 
With fabulous costumes, amazing solo's, dancers, acrobats and puppets, I think people of all ages would enjoy this show. I know we would love to make it a yearly tradition ourselves.",5
Local Flavor,So much fun and I found so many new places to shop that I didn't even know existed! My favorite is the tea shop on stetson and 5th. I bought tea that I can't wait to try. It was fun running all over old town Scottsdale taking crazy pics with my mom and Linda. We ended at Fifth and Wine who had some amazing apps for us to try. Great prizes for the winners...congrats! I can't wait to go back to lots of the shops and spend a lot more time shopping. So nice to learn about all these local places to support. Great job Lindsey and Local First!!!,5
Local Flavor,"The Scavenger Hunt was such a great way to start the Christmas season and discover new local shops . The weather was perfect, there are so many neat places in old town that I never knew existed, I couldn't ask for a better day. It's dangerous for me to work up the road from old town,  because there several places I want to revisit and do some damage to my wallet. Baratin is on my list of spots to check out. Shop Local!!!! Thank you once again Lindsey!",5
Local Flavor,"So. Much. Fun.

We really thought we wouldve been in the top 2 since the majority of places we went told us that we were the 1st people they saw, but a big congrats to the actual winners anyway. ;)

Lindsey U. and I had so much stinkin fun trying to figure out the clues and running around Old Town. We discovered a few places that we'd never heard of that we'll likely be back to, finally made it to a few places we'd heard of but never made it to before Sun, and were ""required to visit at least two old faves.

Cant wait for the next one! Thanks Lindsey and Local First!",5
Local Flavor,"This was alot of fun and a great way for me to check out many places in Old Town that I have never been. Lindsey had us partake in a scavenger hunt armed with a map and clues to find various places. I love that she started us at Orange Table (I had a mimosa) and end at 5th and Wine. 

My personal favorites that I visited (and had never been) were Fashion by Robert Black (the most incredible vintage finds), Outrageous Olive Oils (still thinking about the truffle oil), Art of Merlot (bought a gift certificate to return) and 5th and Wine. 

The only reason I rated this 4 stars is that I felt like there were too many places to find if you wanted to win a prize. In a period of 2.5 to 3 hours, Dolores G and I went to so many places and were exhausted! And then we didn't even come close to winning! lol. I don't care about that but I would have LOVED more time to spend in the various business without feeling rushed to compete. But.....I do feel like this shopping crawl introduced me to some new places that I really like. I would do again, all day long, but probably not be compelled to compete for a prize and rather leisurely explore.",4
Local Flavor,What a fun shopping day! I found so many places I had never been and will be going back to. It was a lot of fun finding the clues and completing the challenges. Had a lot of laughs and met some really great people. Thank you Lindsey for your work organizing this. I have been wanting to try Fifth and Wine for some time and was happy that we ended there. I will be going back! The fries were amazing!,5
Local Flavor,"This was a blast! I participated in the 2nd Yelp Shops Local Holiday Shopping Crawl, and I had a lot of fun doing it. The only reason why I didn't give a 5 star is because I felt rushed doing this and faced a bad experience at one of the stores. I encountered friendly staff except for one shop, but I am not going to mention the name since they were not yelp worthy. The manager even refused to sign my Yelp paper sheet and kind of shoo me away. How rude, but I forgive her. I'm just not going to review her place and not support it. My friends even told me to go back there with my shopping bags and say ""big mistake"" like Julia Roberts from Pretty Woman. ( LOL )  The places worth checking out are: JAMS, Velvet Boutique, The Paper Place, Old Town Candy, Outrageous Olive Oil, Oh my Dog, Tea Time, Classic Cakes, Zoolikins, Poison Pen, Scottsdale Pen. I definitely got my workout running around trying to find those stores on the list. I timed it, and it took me 3 hours! I burned a lot of calories for sure. Unfortunately, I didn't win, but I had a blast! They gave us a goody bag, a $10 gift card and a free brunch at Morning Squeeze complete with mimosas and bloody mary's.",4
Local Flavor,"We did not participate in the shopping crawl but next year I will make it happen.  My husband and I did come early to explore the shops on 5th Ave, it's been forever since we walked up and down 5th Ave to see what shops, salons and restaurants were around.  We checked out a few shops and we told them about our YELP event happening.....they were intrigued and happy to know an event like this was happening.  

Morning Breeze.....we loved this little establishment and we can't wait to go back.  We loved the staff and  the bartenders.  The entire setup is absolutely adorable.  I love the colors and the open patio and the brunch options they served.  Everything they served was delicious.  Lindsey was in fine form....always energetic and making this event so much fun.  Can't wait to go back!",4
Local Flavor,"Super fun event, even on a chilly rainy day! We arrived too late to get in on the scavenger hunt so we visited the awesome shops in the area on our own. We did meet up again at the end of the event for the brunch at Morning Squeeze, which was a ton of fun. Yelp raffled off some fantastic prizes too! Thanks for a great time Lindsey!",4
Local Flavor,I just caught the tail end of this event but enjoyed it.  My wife Marisa did every participating shop.  Some like Michael did every shop and even a dozen that weren't :-),5
Local Flavor,"We were a touch late to the event but it was great fun anyway. Lunch afterwards was great after walking all around town. The shops were nice. And as usual Lindsey organized a great event. Thanks for hosting the brunch, Morning Squeeze!",4
Local Flavor,"A phoestivus for the rest of us.

I had a blast eating shortleash dogs and chatting with friends.
Hope to see you there next week, hurry and get there before it ends.",5
Local Flavor,"The Phoestivus last night was a lot of fun.  My hubby and I walked around and looked at all the cool things that people were selling and tried a couple of samples too.  I bought a cute bracelet from Pure Life Forever by Jenny.  After walking around we decided to have Short Leash for dinner.   Short Leash was amazing as always. :) 

When walking around earlier that night we saw that they had a photo booth.  So we decided to get our picture taken from Social Station and the picture turned out great.  On our way out we stopped by the Yelp Table and had Lindsey F. wrap our gift for us.  She did a great job on our gift.  :)   

Next week they are doing Phoestivus again.  So, if you are in downtown next Wednesday you should check out Phoestivus.",5
Local Flavor,"Phoestivus is a super-fun local holiday market, designed to promote small, locally-owned businesses.  It's held at the Wednesday night downtown Farmer's Market, and this year, expanded to two weeks.  The beer garden was a brilliant addition, and 100% of the profits from it go to support Community Food Connections, the wonderful organization that keeps downtown Phoenix from being a true food desert.  Local brews, local food trucks, local farmers and artists assure that the money you spend will stay here in our community.",5
Local Flavor,"I came ready to air my grievances and once I was there I forgot I had any! 

So many doo-dads, crafty creations, sweet temptations and FOOD TRUCKS!!

From t-shirts and poster with facetious sayings like ""I'm a baby duck.  You, YOU, are nothing!"" and ""When I look in the mirror I see a unicorn.  A bad ass unicorn.""..to shirts made of hemp and necklaces with photos hanging on a sari necklace! Then sweet treats like whoopie pies packaged in gorgeous bows and ties what could very easily be found at Tiffany and Co!  Why not buy yourself a gift and unwrap a tamale?  Doctor Hummus is there too...don't pass him by! 

Live music and picture booths and lavosh and cookies and pies and paletas and...I could go on for days!  

The bff and I had a great time and all the other fun loving people there were just that.  We struck up conversations at every booth and left smiling!  

This is a Phoestivus for the rest of us!",5
Local Flavor,"Love the airing of the grievances.   And the dozen food trucks too.  Beer garden doesn't hurt either.  It is basically just a more festive version of the Saturday market done at night with more food and drinking.  But that's not a bad thing :-)  
btw, yes Short Leash Dog is terrific, but is it 2 dozen people in line terrific when there's a bunch of other great food trucks with no lines right next to it?  I especially love Aji Mobile's El Gaucho sandwich with chimichurri.",5
Local Flavor,Phoestivus has become something I look forward to all year 'round. A great opportunity to get unique and fun gifts for loved ones and celebrate fond Seinfeld memories.,5
Local Flavor,"This was the first year I was able to make it to Phoestivus and I had a great evening! It's a good problem that it looks like they are getting too big for the space with all of the vendors and people they had when I went. I met up with a friend and we first had dinner from Pizza People, which I really liked. Afterwards we walked around and I ended up picking up a couple of items for gifts and we ended the night with a treat from Torched Goodness. I also love that I got to see the Phoenix Public Market is back open as a cafe - I'll have to try it out!",5
Local Flavor,"A Phoestivus for the rest of us! Well, it looks like I am on a Seinfeld theme tonight, which is ok by me. And if you have a problem with that, I suggest you write it down and air your grievances at the Phoestivus next year. :-P

This was a super event. I really wasn't sure if it would be awesome or a total dud. You know how you go to a farmer's market only to find a disappointing 3 stands? This isn't that. There were a ton of vendors, and unique ones like crunchy flavored oatmeal and granolas, cool and interesting graphic tees, homemade peanut butters, lots of baked goods and jewelry, what must have been 10-20 food trucks. There were at least 6-10 rows of packed vendors (10-20 in each row), so there really were items of interest for anyone you might have with you. 

PLUS, the airing of grievances, the most befitting lackluster Phoestivus pole (touted as North America's largest) you could imagine, and a feats of strength area where you can challenge your opponent. It's just a lot of silly Seinfeldian fun that would still leave Frank Costanza bitching, but you would just roll your eyes and enjoy your shopping. 

My bonus was meeting very friendly CM Lindsay at the Yelp table, where, you guessed it- I picked up more Yelpsticks. Schwing for swag! So fun. Just go and plan on staying longer than we did cuz there is a lot to look at if you like to shop, and oh yeah- SHOP LOCAL! ;)",4
Local Flavor,"What an awesome event!  So many local artists and vendors... Its like the weekly farmer's market on holiday steroids.  I bought sugar scrubs from Slather, jewelry from multiple vendors including one who acid washes copper to turn it an awesome turquoise color , and some pottery from a hippy couple based out of Ajo, AZ.  There were food vendors with fresh produce, baked goods, popcorn, chocolate (Nutwhats and Stone Ground are amazing), granola, oats, spices, jams and jellies... You name it, you'll find it local at Phoestivus.  You will also find a multitude of food trucks serving up some delicious fare.  I did not partake in the beer booth, but if you do you'll need to stand in a long line for a 21+ bracelet and then in another line for beer.  So if you're partner is the shopaholic and you need a beer to cope, Phoestivus has provided that for you. =)  Yelp was there offering to wrap if you purchased something as a gift too!",5
Local Flavor,"Yay, Phoestivus!

I made it for the second week, and from what I hear, it was notably more crowded. I didn't end up eating - the lines to the food trucks were all pretty long.

However - did I power shop! Lots of gifts for friends - and I splurged on me, too!

- A gluten free biscuit kit from Rise
- A BUNCH (15!) fantastic chocolate bars from Stone Grindz
- Several bracelets from Lotus and Lava 
- Unfiltered raw local honey from Sun Valley Bees
- Spicy pickled asparagus and red bell peppers from Pickled Perfection
- An earring and necklace set from Michael William Mosaic Jewelry
- An air plant in a a blue T-rex! (damn - forgot to jot down the name of the plant vendor!)

Free gift wrapping from Yelp and the awesome Rachael! (There was no tip jar, so I gave her one of the chocolate bars from Stone Grindz. She's so worth it!)

Had the crowds been a bit more manageable for me, I would have been there longer and likely bought more. My wallet is grateful that didn't happen!

Great music, festive atmosphere, and tons of local businesses all in one place.
Awesome!",5
Local Flavor,"We had a lot of fun, tips for next year, spread out a bit, way to tight walking down aisles with the amount of people was unacceptable. Food trucks were nice but more then 3-4 tables would of helped and more staff helping police the trash would of been nice (damn slobs don't know how to pickup after their self)",3
Local Flavor,"A few thoughts....

If you're accessing this review on a mobile phone while driving.....here's a quick tip: KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD!   

Who will be the eventual Duke of 215 Beltway: a construction worker or some douchebag ticket-writing cop?  It should be the homeless guy at the exit ramp, but doubt he will have the Yelp app let alone mobile phone to check-in

Fun fact#1: the proper name for the beltway is the Bruce Woodbury Beltway, keep that in your back pocket when you get onto Jeopardy

Fun fact#2: the first number of any three digit interstate designates if it deviates from the primary highway (odd) or if it forms a loop to reconnect (even)- this is the one that will get you the hot chick's number at the bar

Dropping the metaphorical microphone onto the ground- friends don't let friends check-in and drive.",2
Local Flavor,"Lol. Okay. Riddle me this, why is it that where you park is called the drive way and where you drive is a parkway? 

Nevermind that. that was too complicated. 215 takes you just about anywhere around Vegas, excerpt the Strip. That's what the 95 is for. It's also practically a big ""U"" so you'll come around.. Or get lost and end up in Kanye's Flashing Lights music video.. Eventually. 

Click it or ticket? Yelp it and check in!",5
Local Flavor,"This was the only part of the expressway in Las Vegas where I could say that you never encounter any traffic, but I will not be able to say that much longer. Once the Shoppes at Summerlin open up it is going to be a mess over here. If you live in West Park say hello to Shopping Center traffic all day long. The holiday shopping season and the weekends are going to be a nightmare.",3
Restaurants,"The widest selection of vodka Martini's, probably in the planet.  It is a bar in the hallway at the Encore outside of Andrea's. It's a bar to get a couple of drinks and continue on.  Only has 10 seats.   Cynthia is a Martini pro! Try the bacon and maple.",4
Restaurants,Awesome peanut butter martini!!!!!!!,4
Restaurants,"Saw this on our way to dinner. Had a cool design and interesting cocktails listed. Wanted to stop in for a cocktail as we were 30 mins early for our reservation. We waited for about 5-10 minutes and then the bartender walked over and said ""I need to see ID"" and then walked away. After another 5 minutes, she checked our IDs and said she would be right with us. We waited another 10 minutes while she chatted with the only other couple at the bar. I got up and left as I didn't want to miss my reservation and the restaurant next door. I honestly had never written a bad review to date but I was annoyed by her lack of professionalism. They lost out on 2 drinks and the chance of another 2 after dinner.",1
Restaurants,"The best night of my life. Incredible drinks. Awesome service. They say that since this is on the casino floor it's not a ""destination bar"". It is my favorite bar in Vegas because the drinks, the atmosphere, the variety, and the knowledge and friendliness of the staff is just perfection. 

Try the Blood Orange Martini, and the Cotton Candy. And the Espresso. They will change your life.",5
Restaurants,Right outside of Andrea's at the Encore. We were waiting on our table and we said what the hell let's have some martinis. I can assure you they make some nice martinis. Whatever flavor crosses your mind this guys will weep up something and it would be very tasty. We got a nice buzz going before we went in and with the cocktails we had at Andrea's it came to be a perfect night.,4
Restaurants,"4 stars for the cool and innovative drinks
2 star for the extreme price

came here  a few times, dont love the service, nothing special here, juist a cool place near a club that has pretty cool and interesting vodka drinks

got a vodka espresso, which surprisingly was really good! you can taste the coffee in the drink, itl give you a nice jolt before you go out and party or club!  but it was like 18 bucks or so",3
Restaurants,"Cool, relaxed, good drinks, expensive.

Cool little lobby bar in the Encore with tons of drinks featuring loads of vodkas.  A few beers for the guys offer another choice.  I had a strong stout bottle of craft beer.
A great spot for before/after dinner drink with a date id you don't want loud music.

The bar has a cool ice rail that stays frosted for cooling your drink.",4
Restaurants,You can order food from Andrea's at the VDKA bar. VDKA is a very casual walk bar bar with about 10 seats on the casino bar. The black cod from Andreas is absolutely delicious! It is sweet and very light. Highly recommend it!,5
Restaurants,"First time coming here and let me tell you!!!! This bar is a must go to spot when in Vegas. It's a small bar in front of Andrea's, on the left side of surrender nightclub.

There's about 10 chairs available, so you're lucky if you get a seat! We ordered some food..they have happy hour! $6 drinks, sushi and some entrees. I ordered the Moscow mule and got a few sushi rolls. All were really good. Our bartender was Armando, he took care of us and even suggested some other drinks for us to try.  I loved the surroundings because it was super chill, but also exciting because of the crowd walking past us. You can even watch sports, and if you ask them, they just might change the channel for you.

All in all, I would definitely come back here. We went on a Saturday night, I would love to see how their crowd is during the weekday.",5
Restaurants,"Great small (10 seats) bar next to Andrea's restaurant and Surrender nightclub at Encore Las Vegas. Tons o' vodka, great cocktails and you can order anything you like from the full Andrea's menu. SO much fun for people watching if you don't want to go to Surrender but want to watch the craziness as people stand in line...",4
Restaurants,Friendly staff. Killer drinks. Cinematic atmosphere.,4
Restaurants,"Located in the newly remodeled Scottsdale Marriott at McDowell Mountain- Agave is a casual restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.  

The interior is contemporary and offers views of the golf course with the mountains in the distance.  They also have a great outside area (what place out here doesn't?) which is perfect to enjoy a glass of wine or a snack with friends.

If sports are your thing- there is HUGE TV (85"") over the bar . . .perfect for the special game or on this night the Golden Globes were on which was a welcome respite from all the football games.  I sat at the bar and ate but there are plenty of tables scattered about or even couch seating areas.

Service was spot on!  Kat, the bartender, took excellent care of us- accommodating our special food requests with a smile and even checking to see if the chef could find some broccoli to cook for me since it wasn't on the menu.  She even offered up a couple of her favorites on the menu (which were the chicken and the fish tacos in case you wanted to know!)

I went for steak and it came up perfectly prepared.  We also had the grilled shrimp skewers which I definitely would order again.  They came with a fresh avocado which was the perfect accompaniment for the cilantro lime sauce on the shrimp.

But if you go- same room for dessert.  And when you do, order the warm fruit tart.  On the night I was there- the fruit was apple.  This thing came out in a little mini skillet- topped with pecans and caramel sauce and served with a big dish of ice cream!  The smell alone made we want to just inhale the entire dish! But savoring it made so much more sense.

A little hard to find as it's buried inside the Marriott but definitely worth looking for!",4
Restaurants,"The Agave is an unsigned restaurant off the lobby of the Scottsdale Marriott hotel.  It looks like a typical resort lobby bar except that it has about 30 tables where food is served.  If they provided a free breakfast to their guests at the Scottsdale Marriott, this would be an appropriate place for it.

So call it a resort coffee shop, but one with a slightly more upscale menu and far better food.  Although the offerings are limited, they are well prepared and use quality ingredients.  Of particular note are the flank steak salad and the meatloaf.  Only the corn fritters were a bit disappointing - not that they were poorly made, just not particularly tasty.  Maybe some chilis in the recipe would help.

So far, the Agave sounds like four stars, but it loses one for two reasons:
1.  It is a bit too expensive for such a casual atmosphere.
2.  The servers are friendly and attentive but not very skilled.  It feels like you favorite aunt is serving you in her dining room.  At least I don't need to tip my aunt.",3
Restaurants,"Came here for an upscale ladies lunch, and this place didn't disappoint.  It's a casual atmosphere (HUGE tv above the bar) with a sophisticated menu (slightly pricey but its a hotel restaurant so what do you expect?).  The service was great - they specially made a salad into a wrap upon request, and the chef actually came out to make sure everything was to our liking.  The ingredients are fresh and the guacamole was great!  It has nice views of the mountains and an outdoor seating area.

If you're looking for a nice sophisticated place to take someone to breakfast, lunch, or dinner, this is definitely an option you should consider.  The valet parking is a plus!

(Note: I think this used to be called Zambra before the hotel remodeled)",4
Restaurants,"Service was pretty bad, but they get extra credit for being open on New Year's Day.  

Watching college football in a comfortable booth while enjoying a mexican breakfast was a great way to begin the new year.  

This restaurant is as you walk into Marriott, as convenient as can be.",4
Restaurants,"Tried to have a peaceful lunch at 12 noon. Leaf blower blaring in the background and dust, pollen and dirt all over the place. Unacceptable Marriott.",2
Restaurants,"2.7/2.8

A bit pricey but then again it's in the middle of a hotel. Two of us had tacos, I had a Sangria (pretty strong, and one of us had wings.) We had 2 sides as well.

I had the chicken tacos while another person had the fish tacos. The chicken tacos, 2 for 12 bucks, were fine while the fish tacos were fine as well.

They allow you to add a whole taco for 2 bucks which is either the best deal or the weirdest deal. I mean, it begs the questions how much these tacos are if you can get an extra one for 2 bucks and it makes it odder as two of them were 6 each (or 7 each for fish.) If I knew it'd be a full taco, I would have gotten 2 extra tacos or something.

Corn/bean succotash side was fine. Same with the corn and quinoa but I preferred the later and neither were super worth it for 5/6 dollars.

Service was in the middle. People were nice enough but it took a while for things to happen and there was some laziness.

The breakfast is A-ok. I don't know the price as well it was free for members of the  tour.",3
Restaurants,Love this Marriott and I enjoy his bar/restaurant. The food is good as far as hotel restaurants go. I was there with a large party and the service was a tad slow. This was annoying because I wanted to keep the prickly pear margaritas flowing! There is a wonderful view from the patio.,4
Restaurants,The smoked brisket tacos are amazing! And if you haven't tried the bread pudding bites.. You are missing out. Probably one of my favorite desserts ever!,5
Restaurants,Amazing resturant. I always get the honey glazed salmon or the quesadilla and the food is always consistent. Love Carla  (New server) she is amazing and very personal. Ask her to serve you when you get there,5
Public Services & Government,"I discovered this location by complete surprise not knowing that the Motor Vehicle Division had a location by Interstate 17 or Deer Valley airport. I had to visit on two separate occasions for a re - examination due to medical reasons. Shame on me I failed the written test on the first occasion...Call me a dumb ass if you like..Well I missed 9 questions and was only allowed to miss six. The second time I missed only two and I passed (after studying the silly book).

On my second visit, I arrived at 2:00 pm, was given a number and by the time I was done, it was 4:30 pm! The place was packed even though it was Tuesday. The staff is friendly and for the most part efficient (just not the second time around). Just bring a lot of patience with yourself and best days to visit by the way are Wednesday and Thursday. 

Why only three stars you might ask...? Well I wasn't blown away or anything, and I deem 2-1/2 hours an awfully long time to wait just to get a driver's license.

For more information, visit www.azdot.gov (the driver license manual as well as practice tests are online)",3
Public Services & Government,Could not believe my eyes that there was 30 people waiting in line before 8am. Super glad that I was out in about an hour. Getting here early is a must.,3
Public Services & Government,"Lady was nice, transaction was quick.  35 minutes total for my title change.  Not bad for the DMV.",3
Public Services & Government,First time here at this location.  Arrived around 7:30am doing some title transfer.  I was about the 10th person in line.  Doors open promptly at 8am.  Out of the door at 8:30am.  Great and fast service.  They know exactly what they are talking about.  Come early if you don't want to wait.  Check their Website for wait time if necessary.,3
Public Services & Government,"For the DMV my experience wasn't too bad. 
The wait wasn't very long (approx 1 hour) and everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful. I was just changing my last name on my car title. Four dollars later, I walked out with my new title, no problem.  Sure, I'd rather wait LESS time but when you're expecting it... it isn't too bad. 

Does.... smell a bit in there. Can't put my finger on what it is... But I'm sure it's just an old building or something.",4
Public Services & Government,"I am never toooo excited to hang out at this place...Who is, right? 

The service at this location was good. Employees Were friendly and kind of funny. The lane moved fast.

However, do you ever wonder, why is it that MVD offices are always filthy, smelly, and cluttered? How expensive can air freshener be? As citizens, we still have to pay for all the services at MVD. How about some fresh air....Am I asking for too much?",3
Public Services & Government,"The lady at the information counter told my mom and I that we did not need my dad here to transfer the title into my name since it is his name on the title. We asked her if she was sure and she said yes since it was notarized. We waited 2 hours yes I repeat TWO HOURS and when we finally got called up we were told that yes we do need my dad here. We were FURIOUS. We had to call my dad and make him come up here and wait another 30 mins!!! I will never be back to the mvd on 26th ave north of the 101. The wait time, old dirty office, and poor customer service is despicable",1

I don't what I was thinking ......",1

Public Services & Government,"This DMV pretty much sucks.

I was excited when I walked in and there was 1 person in front of me at the information desk. The lady was friendly and helpful and told me it would be about an hour wait. 

Well, here I sit an hour and forty-five minutes later, and my number still hasn't been called. 

I had to use the bathroom once and they had 1 stall with a non-functioning lock and 1 urinal. Not the most disgusting bathroom I've ever seen at a DMV, but probably the smallest. And come on, fix your lock.",2

Restaurants,"We had a great dinner, great view and great waiter, Tony!  What a terrific Valentine's Eve dinner.",5
Restaurants,"Atmosphere, service and food was good. We had a table next to the window so view of the water was great. We both had the filet mignon which was very tender and mashed potatoes had wonderful flavor. Husband had the lobster bisque soup which he loved and said there were several large chunks of lobster. Salad bar was also very fresh.",4
Restaurants,Beautiful setting. Highly recommend crab stuffed prawns and Filet Mignon. Salad bar is the best I've ever had ~ with a Caesar chef and caviar. Friendly clientele includes a lot of loyal locals. Note: It lost a star for the distracted greeting upon arrival and terse server.,4
Restaurants,"Easter Sunday with friends.. Perfect table outside on the patio. We started with a few drinks and appetizers. The shrimp and crab Stack appetizer  was recommended by our server Michael. It was an excellent recommendation.  He was a terrific server!  We also had the hummus trio which was also delightful. We all voted for the Chilean Seabass special at $35 ea... two were spicy two were not...they  had shrimp and crabmeat on top!! Delicious !!  The gentleman ordered mud pie for dessert as well as a bowl of berries with pineapple. Everyone left full and happy!! 

It was a wonderful afternoon with great friends,  food and service. Looking to back again soon !",4
Restaurants,"This restaurant on a beautiful lake is a really relaxing experience. The happy hour is worth checking out, the food is really fresh. I especially like the prime rib sliders with creamy horseradish. The spinach dip with toasted baguette slices for dipping is yummy. They have a happy hour menu with something for everyone. There's a bit of an 80's country club vibe but I dig it!",4
Restaurants,"The atmosphere is real nice especially sitting on the patio.  We use to go here all the time, they have a nice salad bar even through the price keeps increasing.  I do not eat caviar so maybe a different price for folks who do not eat caviar would be better but paying $17.00 for a salad bar is kind of too expensive.. We do not go here much anymore as we recently found out there calm chowder comes from a can rather than homemade and all their meats and fish dishes are farm raised nothing is grass fed or organic.  They do not  buy the cream of the crop meats and prefer farm raised.  Imagine paying close to $20. for farm raised Atlantic salmon.  Not a good value for food especially since such poor quality.  Nice atmosphere and great wait staff but nothing else.",2
Restaurants,"Originally I wanted to come here because of my previous experience at a different ChartHouse (Portland, OR) & I remember everything being top notch there. 

Despite reviews, my husband & I decided to come here for our first wedding anniversary. Upon arrival, we noticed that it was pretty empty inside, but just played it off for being a Monday evening.

Our waitress was great, lots of personality & recommendations, & of course she was super friendly.. But theres a couple things where my experience just fell super short. For one, service was SO SLOW-- especially for it being a Monday evening & only 5 other people there that I could count. We ordered drinks right away & asked if we wanted any bread.. Well, our drinks came after our appetizers for one (about 20 mins after being seated), & the bread never even showed. I guess it was forgotten?

For appetizers we had the kimchee calamari & my husband ordered a crab cake-- both were delicious! For entrees we got the salmon with artichoke & he got the prime rib, then of course you cant forget dessert-- chocolate lava cake w/ peanut butter ice cream (housemade). All the food was great, but I can't overlook the extremely slow service, especially on a dead evening. I hope something is done to improve service soon because I would love to give this CH a second chance!",3
Local Flavor,"Great fun for a Sunday in February!
Classic cars, classic homes, vendors and --the best part--FOOD TRUCKS!
Gorgeous weather helped make it a fun day out with the fam.",5
Local Flavor,"I was a bit disappointed this year because it was so crowded.  I only got to see a few of the 15 homes.  I was only really impressed with one house this year.  In the past there were some amazing places, once even the apartments built in the 1930's.",3
Local Flavor,"If you can, go early and move fast, as the lines get painfully long by noon. That's a good thing for enthusiasm for home restoration, right? There are free trolleys that run in loops around the tour sites, for times when the experience starts seeming a little... vigorous.

The 2015 tour had 10 houses plus some art studios. The highlight was the historic firehouse because really, what else is as cool as an old firehouse? Not that there aren't fascinating features to the regular houses -- it's a kitchen, bath, and patio extravaganza with many nifty features. Home ages this year ranged from 1930 into the early 1940s, plus one 1999 ""new old"" house.

Like some of the 2013 reviewers, I thought I remembered there being more houses, with more variety, in previous years; but it's still really cool. There's also a street fair (in which literally 1 in 5 passersby was telling a companion how street fairs are different in Minnesota) and food trucks. It's a pleasant walk, and one gets to feel smug about how, though street fairs in Minnesota might be larger, in February, they would be buried under the snow.",4
Local Flavor,"We were there early (around 2 o'clock) and it was pretty quiet. It's definitely geared towards kids and familes, and the band even had some kids dancing up on stage. Some retired baseball stars were there, like Rollie Fingers, which was very cool. All-in-all a good little warm-up to Spring Training.",4

Arts & Entertainment,"First off, if anyone reading this gets offended, please be aware that as an American, I do in fact have the right to an opinion. I don't want to get shot!

I support the Democratic party, but since my red state dad was in town, i thought it might be interesting to take him to the gun show. i am a gun owner but the thought of being around several thousand other gun owners made me a bit nervous. 

it's kind of a rip-off. 7 bucks to park, 16 bucks to get in the place. and then everything in there is mostly over priced. it is kind of a nightmare for a liberal like me....the things overheard should make the owners of those comments ashamed of themselves. race, religion, sex...i overhead every kind of hateful thing said about every other race, religion, sex, etc. and to top it off, even my father...a gun-totin, conservative republican said to me as we were leaving ""Well, i can see why most people shouldn't own guns"". one of the scariest things i overheard from a vendor was this: a young man walks up to one of the sellers of guns. the young man says ""So what's your background and paperwork requirements?"". the gun seller says ""how about cash?"" and that was it. a semi-automatic AR-15 was sold. 
there was a line for ammunition about 3 hours long. people seem to be really scared about their guns and ammo getting taken away. this happens every 5 years or so. 

in any case, an excellent place for mullet spotting, but i wouldn't go back and would advise anyone with any sense to avoid it as well.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"As a hardcore card carying gun toting NRA member, I would have to agree with some of this democrats comments, crossroads used to be a cool show to attend but they are just gouging show attendees, $27 for parking and entrance ticket, f u crossroads, just go to Walmart or cabelas for ammo and order everything else online or go to local shops that don't charge for parking or to just walk in the door. With that said, no gun show should be banned, let the free market dictate success.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I went to the gun show at the University of Phoenix stadium. Location is much better than at the fair grounds. Parking is free and that's about the only good thing about the entire gun show. Entrance ticket was $17 (there is a $1 off coupon from the event web site). Once in the event all the guns were over priced and the used guns were in rough shape for the same price as new at local gun shops. Lots of Chinese replacement parts, scopes and knives. Some custom ladies bags and sandals, basically lots of non gun related crap. Don't waste your time or money going to this show, just go to your local gun shop or go on-line.",1
Arts & Entertainment,Mostly junk.  Shady sellers.  Overpriced ammo.  Less expensive at overpriced Cabela's.   Expensive to enter the event to look around.  Stay away.,1
Arts & Entertainment,"Great gun show in Phoenix.  Lot's of venders, not so many ""junk tables""  food was good by prices high.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"$16 to get inside the Phoenix Stadium to look at the most over priced guns and ammo I have ever seen. This event was literally across the street from Cabelas and I could have bought anything cheaper at Cabelas without a door fee. Cabelas is also known for the highest prices in the valley for guns (probably to pay for the beautiful store)
At Croasroads show there is cheap crap there for sale. A bunch of no name brands.
Here is an example of a overpriced gun.
I bought a new Ruger LC9 4 years ago for about $345 at a local gun store and there is already a newer better version out... yet they are selling used ones for more money than I bought mine new. Many around  $389

You would think that with a door fee the prices would be at least competitive but they are not. They are far from competitive. I would imagine a gun show with a high volume of customers what have the prices slightly lower then the local gun shops to move quantity not make huge profits.
Unfortunately new people that are getting into guns are going to go there and pay overpriced money for this stuff and then realize later on that day got screwed.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Arrived at the very end of the day on Sunday but still full $8 parking and full $16 entry (way overpriced), even though some vendors had started packing up.  They won't take the $1 coupon on your phone like virtually every other place on the planet so had to pay full price.

The vendors I was looking for either weren't there or didn't have what I wanted. All in all $24 flushed down the toilet and an hour of wasted driving while still noticing many of the prices are high.

The only people making out seem to be Crossroads, since they charge a steep admission and also charge the booth vendors.  I say save your time and money, since you can most likely do better.

The sad part is that many of the vendors are great people and Crossroads is hurting their booth attendance with the ridiculous admission price.  If they even cut the price down to $10, more people would come, causing the vendors to sell more.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"There were NO GUNS for sale at this stupid show.  Really, a few old beat up antiques and that's about it.  STUPID.  We went with cash in hand, ready to drop $1,200, and they had NOTHING.  Maybe it's because it was in California, but they should have told people they have NO GUNS before we went.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"I will say I got a decent price on what I went there for.  It was a local vendor, very small time and was hassle free.  Got a great price.  But it was literally buy from them or leave empty handed as the pricing for most items are easily beaten online, that is without factoring in the  the $40 I paid for two of us to park and enter.  Some people were actually selling for $100-150 more than you can easily find online for some new stuff.  Roll your eyes, move on.   

I wish certain gun people realized one party or one ideology does not have a monopoly on the hobby.  Not everyone possesses them for the same reasons.  Being an election year, the political groups were in full force.  The non ""gun show"" stuff is quite annoying.

The people watching is fantastic, as is any event in this dumpy part of town, just magnified with the gun show experience.  But overall, I don't get why we pay so much to get in.  Why not charge vendors more?  Maybe they got tired of the window shopping, and only want shoppers in there, who knows.  

There are some quality vendors, with helpful employees.  so it isn't all bad, and there is an incredible variety, great place to look for ideas of something you maybe never got to handle, or considered purchasing.  There are deals to be had.  Do your research online, and at your local stores, if you see a deal, go for it.  If not, eat the $40 entrance fee and bail.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"Always new vendors, good prices, friendly people and I will be at the next one!",5
Public Services & Government,"There's no such thing as a "" good "" welfare office, but this location is super fast if u have to go its worth the drive to come to this one",4
Public Services & Government,"just because i'm on medicare you guys don't offer me dental when i'm having a true dental emergency but you guys were able to keep me in a treatment center. i have big holes in my back teeth. i have to have 5 teeth extracted & i already have bad infection & have been in very severe pain. i am on a very limited income & i have nobody helping me pay the rent. my parents will sue you guys if i die because the dentist said the infection could spread to other parts of the body & die. but you guys don't seem to care as all you guys put me on was partial medicaid. when i was in california & lost my daughter i was cut off what they called medi cal in 2005. and i feel it was wrong of them to do that. i need some dental care right away because i have anxiety, can't sleep, cry all the time, scared, & worried. it isn't right you guys don't offer dental to everybody. i don't make enough to pay out of pocket expenses. and both my mom & i tried applying for that care credit & we both got denied as i'm knee high in debt.",1
Restaurants,"Went for the first time today, being a newer restaurant, we were the only customers.  I drink my coffee and black and theirs was not bitter at all and it was hot and freshly brewed.  
 We both had the choose 4 for $7 breakfast, I chose 2 eggs poached, home fries, french toast and Rye toast and my partner did 4 eggs over medium, home fries and pancakes .  My eggs were poached perfectly with no runny whites but with runny yolks and the over medium eggs were also cooked perfect and NOT soaked in oil (which is rare). The home fries were good, crispy but soft inside and nicely seasoned. The french toast could have used a little cinnamon but over all were good and not soggy. The pancakes were soft and fluffy and tasted great but were not as warm as he'd would have liked.
 Over all it was a nice breakfast for under $20 for two large breakfast, coffee and a orange juice. living pretty close to Rendezvous I feel this could become a regular breakfast stop for us. 
 serving full menu 7 AM-3 PM daily",4
Restaurants,"Stopped in for lunch, and ordered the Gyro with a (beautiful) side of fruit. The service was nice, and the food delicious and well-portioned for the price. Will definitely be back.",5
Restaurants,"The food was a 3.5, the ambiance a 2. When we walked in the employees seemed surprised that we were there to eat.  The only menus that they have are paper to go menus which feel a little weird when you are eating in. They don't have any music or TV in the background which made us feel like we were intruding on their work. As they say, 'the silence was deafening.' The booth where we were seated had a large outdoor sign tucked behind it which awkwardly stuck out during our meal. The seating layout is also very strange. The good news is that the food was really good and they deliver. I think I may order delivery from them, but wouldn't dine in again. Rendezvous Cafe seems like a catering business, not a restaurant.",3
Restaurants,"Ate here for the first time this morning at 11:15 a.m.  As A.B. guessed, they are primarily a catering gig.  There were only two other parties there. The family ordered off of the menu--eggs Benedict, patty melt, and 2 your way.  I ordered the skillet, as advertised on the window.

I've eaten at most of the breakfast joints around town. Add this place to the list of good ones. Potatoes and eggs were perfect, the portions are huge, and everything came out about the same time. Service is attentive, and friendly.  Check out the pics of the Benedict and skillet--we'll be eating this for tomorrow's breakfast!",4
Restaurants,"Went for take-out last Sunday, only two other parties there. Appears to be family run and just getting started - hope they make it because everything was delicious.  Not instantaneous food, but worth the wait for the made-to-order, home-cooked taste.  Everything was very good, generously portioned and reasonably priced. Best oatmeal we have ever had.",5
Restaurants,"Huge Portions, great prices. I have been several times over the last few months and the food keeps getting better. The place always has a seat open, great location next to movies, killer desserts and the specials are fantastic.Everything is homemade and the delivery is free. I brought my neighrbor and now his wife and him visit the place as well. Friendly staff and the Invisible  Chef is one of the best in Las Vegas. My family loves this place. We ate here labor day. Rib dinners $8. can't beat that. Very please. recommend to all.",5
Restaurants,"I called from clear across the country to request an order be delivered to my ill daughter who lives within their delivery circle. Renee was wonderful on the phone informing me of their menu. I had bowls of chicken soup, salad, fresh fruit and a sandwich sent..... My girl was really surprised and said a LOT of food arrived.  Thank you so much for the good service and delivery.",5
Restaurants,"Yummy food, huge portions, beyond reasonably priced, and family owned and operated. What more can you ask for??  Have the waffles with the apple butter... So good!!
Edited to add: Totally forgot to mention how awesome the service was! We will be back for sure and are thinking of asking them to cater for us.",5
Public Services & Government,"There's not much to say about a DMV. Expect to wait a long time, deal with lethargic government employees, and feel the pain of forking over more money to the gov't.

This was my second time at an Arizona DMV, as I was having a title transferred and registering my car in AZ, lest I get pulled over by the AZ police.

I was pleasantly surprised to see this government office with hours that actually coincided with that of the American populace--M-F 8-5. I arrived at 8 so I could be into work at 9, and I was. The process was smooth and cost less than I was expecting to pay, and that's always a good thing. Giving the government less of my money is always the goal. 

Compared to other DMVs I've had the pleasure of wasting my life in, this ranks middle of the road. PENNDOT in Pennsylvania is utterly terrible. Do yourself a favor and take a Xanax before stepping foot inside. However, the DMV in Clark County, Las Vegas is surprisingly efficient, especially for the extreme volume pumping into that place. 

Adding a coffee station inside the waiting room would detract from the perceived wait time and be a nice touch as a whole. Get on it gov't.",2
Public Services & Government,Closes at 5 but last ticket is given at 4:30. I was in line and when I was got to the counter at 4:31 I could not be helped. Ridiculous,3
Local Flavor,I had so much fun diving through the decades at Vintage Pittsburgh!,4
Local Flavor,So much fun!!!!,4
Local Flavor,Wonderful vendors in our very own Lawrenceville neighborhood.  Doesn't get better than that.  Found a few treasures.  i wish they had these more often!,5
Local Flavor,"I have never been to one of these before!!!  Such a great time.  The moment I walked in I saw a beautiful Pendleton jacket I had to have.  The music by Jay Malls was perfect browsing vintage items.  There were a ton of vendors, and really great items. I only wish I would have shown up when the doors opened!  Can't wait for the next one of these!!",5
Local Flavor,This was my first year attending so I wasn't sure of what exactly to expect but I had a lot of fun. I wish they would have had vendors on all of the floors and more spread out. The showroom was pretty cramped which made it difficult to look through some of the racks. It was great to see so many lovers of vintage in one place.,4
Local Flavor,"We had a nice time at the mixer. Everyone was super friendly and we enjoyed browsing the wares and then the History center. I would definitely not buy the VIP a second time. The room was small and there weren't as many vendors selling non-clothing items as expected. We would have had plenty of time with the regular admission and the gift bag was appreciated, but nothing to really be stoked about.",3
Local Flavor,Absolutely adore the semi-annual vintage mixers here in Pittsburgh! Nothing is too expensive and it's a great time even if you don't purchase anything! All of the vendors are so perky and fun. They really do a fantastic job planning these. I regret ever missing one.,5
Local Flavor,"Best way to end a week.. wine, shopping, and fantastic company. Lines were a little long but went quickly. 

LOVED seeing the Yelper-helpers, always a treat :)",5
Local Flavor,"A a volunteer, I didn't enjoy the Wine Walk at Town Square as much as I did at Lake LV. The guests were a little more.. hostile. 

Nevertheless, New Vista Wine Walks offer a great opportunity to give to a deserving charity while enjoying a great night out with friends or a romantic night with a loved one. The one thing I liked about the Town Square WW is that they offered a couple food vendors so guests were able to get their snack on while sipping their wines, there is also a larger selection for dinner before/after the walk.",4
Local Flavor,"I loved the idea of sampling wine and walking around with great company! There are 20 wines to sample ranging from different types of red and white. The great side about this wine walk is how it is a fundraiser for New Vista, a non profit organization that helps out those who suffer from mental illnesses and disabilities by teaching them and providing homes.",5
Local Flavor,"I was not pleased with this event.

I have been to numerous wine tasting events and this one seemed a little unorganized.

Many stations were unmanned and 2 of the stations were not available.

I overheard many people comment on the volume of wine poured in our glass or lack of wine in our glass. ( more below )

When we arrived and received our wristbands and punch cards, the first table we ventured to was not ready to accept any customers.
We went to another station and they were very pleasant and we continued along. We did not have a map or any direction to where to go next, so we followed another couple and came across another empty table with bottles of wine, but no one to pour. 

We waited for a few and then walked across the street to another table. The person there noticed no one at the table across from them and was going to go over there to cover.


On the volume of wine in the glass.

I know there are 20 different wines to taste if you visit every station.
I do not like all wines and I wanted to atleast get a taste of the wines I wanted. The pours seemed a little on the skimpy side.

If I didn't get my coupon on Living Social, I would probably rate this a 2.

I think this is for a good cause and I am only giving this a 3 star due to the affiliation with New Vista Charity.",3
Local Flavor,"Not an efficient way to toast wine. 5 stations, 3 wines at each station. Very long lines. :(",1
Local Flavor,"I look forward to their annual 5k run.  It's for a good cause and there are a ton of great people who participate.  Every year it seems to get bigger.  I run for fun and there's no shortage of fun at their event.

I don't have any friends or family members who are impacted by Breast Cancer, but I always support the cause anyway.  One of the most inspirational things about the 5k event is seeing all of the survivors out there running or walking.....it makes me feel like I can accomplish anything.

Return Factor - 100%",5
Local Flavor,"Great race today, well organized. I like the way they separated the runners from the walkers on two different sides of the road. Many races are a mess because they have one starting line and the walkers line up early to get up front and are in the way. So very helpful not to have a bunch of people standing around talking when I'm trying to get started.

Lots of fun free stuff they were giving out everywhere, even some cool hats. Most of the free stuff like shirts and hats you would never where again, but these hats I will probably get some use out of. Plus of course the whole event was for a great cause.",4
Local Flavor,"This is my second year running (well walking) in this race and I have to say both times were great. I agree with Elnino and Kayla, it truly is inspiring to be surrounded my survivors and people that come out to support the cause. Each time before the race starts they talk about how hopefully next year there won't be a need for a race... Someday. 

Last year the weather was a bit cooler but I didn't mind at first, since a large portion of the race is on nice, shaded streets. It' not till the last mile that there is no shade and you start to grow tired. Nonetheless the people cheering you on helps a lot and you finish feeling good.

My only issue is that the festivities don't last longer. Last year we headed home immediately because we didn't have our wallets on us. This year after the race I was really cranky and wanted to eat before ewe walked down Freemont so we decided to go to Eat, which thankfully wasn't as full as you'd expect (although in retrospect, I know now why). After breakfast we headed towards Freemont but all the booths and people were gone, by 11; 30 a.m.! Even if the vendors had left, you would think the racers would have stuck around to party. I think next year we will walk around BEFORE The race and then have a leisurely breakfast. 

All in all, I love these races and would like to participate more in the future!",5
Local Flavor,"Great event for a great cause! They had a lot vendors, good information, location was perfect!",5
Local Flavor,"Pinkwashing concerns about the Komen Foundation aside, Race for the Cure is a great annual community event and 2015 is the 20th year it's been held here in Vegas. 

PROS:
+ Race day packets (number bib, shirts, timing chip) mailed out prior to the race, no need to show up early or plan a separate trip downtown.
+ Easy $5 add-on charge for timing chip option. All runs should have this available.
+ Separate sides of the street for runners and walkers! 
+ I love the flat course through downtown. There were several cheer leading, water, first aid, and music stations along the way.
+ Free parking garages and park-and-ride options to avoid congesting downtown.

CONS: 
- No safety pins included with bibs? A lot of people showed up with one large pin holding their bib on. I guess most people don't have safety pins lying around the house these days.
- Water stations were handing out full size water bottles. In theory, this is generous, but no one was drinking entire bottles and the route was littered with trashed bottles that were still mostly full.
- Considering this is breast cancer awareness and fundraising event, I was surprised not to see much information about breast exams, causes, preventative measures, new research, or anything really beyond the color pink plastered all over everything. 

Would I participate again? Yeah. The mood was infectiously positive and it's a great event. I just wish more educational aspects were worked in.",4
Local Flavor,My home family and work family has taken part for 6 years. The community presence is fantastic. There is so much support for our survivors. It is also an amazing time to give tribute and help fund Breast cancer research.,5
Local Flavor,"I have been a volunteer with the Susan G. Komen Race For The Cure for the past ten years. I I served as the race chair for three years and I really got to know the ins and outs of the race. This is a large event which takes about nine months to put together. It is put on by volunteers and businesses donating their goods, services and time. 

The best part of helping out with this race is seeing and interacting with all the survivors during expo week and on race day. I have met some really amazing and strong women and men who have beat breast cancer and come back each year to participate in this event. The good news is that 75% of the funds raised at the race stay in Nevada to help those that need the help the most. The remaining 25% goes towards research for finding a cure. 

They also have all kinds of really fun fundraising events during October which is breast cancer awareness month and I have volunteered for those events as well. 

I am proud to have given so much of my free time to the race and other events. I have had many friends diagnosed with breast cancer and seen them fight their way through it. I have lost a couple of friends too. I am hoping that someday, a cure will be found for this awful disease and it will just be a disease of the past.",4
Local Flavor,doesn't have too much to do. got bored after a little while...,2
Local Flavor,So well organized and so fun! I hope they do it again next year!!,5
Local Flavor,"Lots of things to do and to see.  There's bike riding, kayaking, geo-caching, fishing, yoga and lots of exhibits.  I had fun watching the Unção Capoeira Pittsburgh dancers and talking to some of the vendors.  The event was well organized and lots of fun.  If you are looking forward to kayaking, you may need to stand in line and wait, as that's a popular thing to try and there are only so many boats.",5
Local Flavor,I'm volunteering here and it's a great opportunity to find outdoor activities! Especially for any outdoor enthusiasts who have any sort of disability. Tons of tents with options,5
Local Flavor,"Less crowded than typical Pittsburgh festivals, likely because of the rain. A good lineup of events going on, but not great communication to the attendees about where to register or get in line to participate...",4
Local Flavor,"Great to get the young ones active. Ventor freebies, ideas for future trips and experiences, as well as free activities including examples of homemade yard games.",5
Local Flavor,Cool event. I wish they had publicized it better.,4
Local Flavor,"I love this festival. Lots of great activities for kids, kayaking on the river, a climbing wall, and more. Overall, this is fantastic event to learn more about a wonderful organization!",5
Local Flavor,"I'd like to think that the temperature was set so that we could burn as many calories as we were ingesting. Ok maybe  not AS MANY, but any help counts, right?

For starters, how awesome is the Yelp community that when I didn't make the list (really, i'm not as cool as you thought), Danielle (another fellow Elite) offered to bring me as her +1? Seriously, that was freaking awesome and so so sweet of her. Obviously it was even better that she and her crew ended up being so cool and fun to hang out with. Aww, The Yelpers bring the warm and fuzzies within.

Alright back to the sugar coma. Holy cow LGO was feeding us like they were prepping us for a marathon. I managed to eat 3/4 of the pain au chocolat (chocolate filled croissants) and after that I couldn't manage eating more than a bite of each thing... but i tried EVERYTHING. And, despite not having knifes to go halfies on stuff, we still managed to share to prevent being wasteful on the amazing treats that they had out. Although the desserts were superb, the breakfast treat table was still my favorite. Well, after the mint flavored ice cream, that tasted like a mojito on an herbal crack sans the alcohol. Then I saw the chefs put scoops of peach ice cream on the champagne and my eyes almost fell out of my socket.

Props to Lindsay for having the brilliant stroke of genius to hand out those hand-fans.. but mostly, props to the dude that had the balls to propose to his girlfriend in front of a crowd of hungry strangers. Hey, at least they had free champagne at their disposal immediately after. Right? Damn right.",4
Local Flavor,"Dahl's Charlie has nothing on me. We walked into a room where four scoops of Gelato was only the beginning of this Diabetic Coma Affair. We then walked into the back kitchen and there were 5 tables full of any sweet treats you can imagine. Scones, muffins, cupcakes, cakes, brownies, and cookies. Also, a table of wine spritzers and water to wash down the indulgence. They even had their signature, and oh so yummy, English Muffins. It was fun watching them bake them too. 

I honestly have to say for the first time ever in my life that I am full. lol --I am actually so stuffed right now and full of sugar I am just staring at the walls in a daze. Teehee. The thought of ever eating another sweet treat again is making me sick. Okay, ask me again in three hours and I am sure I will deny ever saying that. 

By the way, the Swag Bag is to die for. Inside were two ten dollar credits to come back for more sweet treats and even more sweet treats in the bag. Sigh, again boo to the summer goal of getting skinny. I have no will power at all.

Thanks as usual to Lindsey who is the queen! Oh yeah, Wow! Did I mention there was even a wedding proposal at tonight's event? So sad I was in the front room and I missed it. I heard the cheering though. How sweet ( No pun intended) of the future groom who knows his gal likes to bake. I wonder if he put the ring inside one of those huge cookies or cupcakes?  :0)",5
Local Flavor,"Holy Crap, I think my extremities are going numb from early onset diabetes. I ingested SO much delicious, sugary goodness and washed it all down with too much pink champagne. Too good for the common man, I tell you.

I started off with the artisan gelato that was offered as we entered the hallowed halls of the baking room room at LGO. Seriously I felt like I was at Willy Wonka's because there were so many BEAUTIFUL baked goods and LOTS of them. All that was missing was oompa Loompas working the tables and singing cheerful songs. What we got instead were the gracious and talented LGO team offering up their best.

A DJ spun some righteous, posh tunes while two candelabras added some atmosphere while I stuffed my face with gelato, cinnamon roll, mini cakes, a lighter than you can imagine English Mufffin and, wait for it, brownies with the French Sea Salt. It's not just for cookies anymore! Now that I think about it, I kind of feel like I was a first year at Hogwarts too. Too much good stuff.

Quarters were a little close and it got a little stifling at times, but what else would you expect when you have a small space, lots and lots of good stuff and throw in some Yelpers? Fortunately fans were distributed and I managed to keep cool with the pink champagne.

Mondays really suck but I will never complain about a Monday again after tonight........now I think it's time to keep drinking.",5
Local Flavor,"As my first Yelp event in the Phoenix area, my friend and I had a great time and were both VERY impressed with the event!

From the moment arriving where we were greeted by Lindsey and then treated to four flavors of delicious gelato, the first impression was a very positive one!  We then saw english muffins being baked fresh in the ""breakfast for dessert"" area.  We made some new friends in the cupcake area (where some Yelpers were decorating their own cupcakes) and shared a few of the desserts before checking out some of the other cakes and cookies (and getting the opportunity to suggest some new cookie ideas for LGO).  Then there were some drinks and water to wash down the delicious snacks.  Add in plenty of fun conversations with other Yelpers and finally, a great gift bag on the way out with pistachios, cookies, an english muffin,  and some LGO bakery gift cards.  

While this was an amazing event, I have always been a huge fan of LGO whether the bakery, pizzeria, gift shop, gelato, or coffee.  Thanks to Yelp and LGO for a great evening!",5
Local Flavor,"OMG, I am delirious.   This event was right up my alley, all the sweetness and carbs necessary to put me on a comma.  LGO went all out and provided FULL SIZE items.  The cookies were gigantic.  Since my hubby was sent away on business, I asked my friend Maryanne to come with me.  I am so glad,  because we shared the items we sampled.  I couldn't possibly sample as much.  I loved  one of the cakes that had the peaches on top, so moist and delicious.  The cookies were great, but what amazed us the most was the home made english muffins, OMG, they are so delicious.  My friend ended up buying some to take home to her family.  The gelato sampling was awesome, I loved, loved, loved the peach sorbetto, so refreshing.  The mint, chocolate chip was great, also.  I could taste the fresh specs of mint.  My friend gave me a great idea for the twins birthday.  I am going to have LGO cater an ice cream social for us.  Hopefully they can make the cookies a little smaller.  They can make any flavor ice cream you want  as long as you order at least a gallon, which is going to be easy, most of my twins' guests come in pairs, so the number is pretty high.  
Thank you, Lindsey for setting this amazing event up and of course all the people from LGO who were so gracious and informative.",5
Local Flavor,"After the absolute worst day possible at work, being tired, hot, tired, and frustrated...Le Grande Orange and Lindsay saved the day! I still can't believe the amount and size of all the goodies! My favorite was the chocolate croissant. The red velvet cupcakes and english muffins were also amazing. So awesome that we bought some to english muffins to bring home. And the swag bag...OMG! Two $10 vouchers to buy more goodies and more sweets! They really spoiled us. I am very impressed at how well they treated us. How did I not know about this place! I will now be a regular! I can't wait to go have another chocolate croissant and try some of their food. I will think fondly of them in the morning when I have my muffin for breakfast and a cookie with lunch! It is like the party doesn't have to stop with all the goodies I have still to eat from the bag!",5
Local Flavor,"I can't think of a better place to go into a sugary food coma than at LGO's bake shop! Much thanks to Lindsey for hosting this amazing event that included smooth, refreshing gelato, various baked goods such as croissants and English muffins, and delicious sweets such as cupcakes, brownies, cookies, and small cake bites. Everything was freshly made from scratch. Even the marshmallow fluff in the fluffernutter cake was made on site! My favorites were the cake bites with the blood orange gelatin topping, the buttery, flaky croissants, and quite possibly the best English muffins I've ever had! These large, soft, pillowy savory treats were made fresh on the griddle by one of the talented chefs here.

Drinks included pink bubbly champagne, water, and something in a heated container (Coffee? Tea?). The goody bags after the event were equally amazing, as they included one of LGO's lovely English muffins, 3 different cookies, a sample of granola from Grateful Spoon Gelato, and a voucher for the LGO bake shop! 

Although parking at LGO is always a bit of a difficult process, it was relatively painless using the valets around the corner, who were very friendly and efficient. 

I'm definitely a fan of LGO's bake shop after this event! I can't wait to use those vouchers! Thanks again Lindsey!",5
Local Flavor,master-bakers.,5
Local Flavor,"Who cares if you have a muffin top the next day, Sweet Bake In at LGO was awesome!  So Anna M. and I were hanging out later by the cooler area by the gelato stand and I had gotten rid of my champagne glass.  A nice gentleman had gone all around the room that evening filling people's glasses, of course, I kiddie with him not having a glass anymore. He said if you have a glass I can pour...so the next time he came around, I presented him with a glass...well a gelato cup but it could still hold the champagne.  With a look and a grin he poured...twice ..then the third time he brought me a glass :-) Adorable! We thanked him for the evening and went on our way to dinner where he later showed up with more champagne for us.  Thank you Cole! We loved the muffins and you!",5
Local Flavor,"I seriously think I am in a sugar coma tonight!  A night indulging in GIANT cookies (the peanut butter cookie was my fave), cakes, cupcakes, pastries goodies, gelato (yummy peach gelato), freshly made English muffins, champagne, coffee, and much, much more.  You can taste until your heart's content.  Oh my!  If that wasn't enough, we all left with more delicious goodies in a gift bag.  Kudos to Lindsey, Yelp, & LGO!   Look forward to try other delious goodies from the bake shop.",5
Local Flavor,"I have heard so many good things about La Grande Orange and having this be a Yelp event, finally gave me a reason to go.  I loved the gelato.  The chocolate was my favorite.  I also tried the red velvet cupcake and a cinnamon roll.  I love red velvet, but I feel like the frosting was too sweet.  Now people who know me, know that I have a huge sweet tooth and for me to say something is too sweet, really means, it's too sweet.  The cinnamon roll was good, but I only like eating the inside part of it, because it's softer.  I loved that our location was ""behind the scenes"".  That was pretty cool.  All the staff was so nice and helpful.  Everyone was smiling.  There were goodie bags to take home too.  I thought that was really nice, since my husband was supposed to come with me, but got off work really late.  This way, I was able to bring him home some of the good stuff that he missed.

I do think I will go back.  The only issue I found was the parking.  I knew from driving past LGO on prior occasions, that parking was not going to be fun, but this time, when my destination was LGO, I really didn't know where to go.  There wasn't really any clear sign.  I saw that there is complimentary valet parking, but I wasn't sure where to pull into and each time I tried to pull into the teeny tiny parking lot, there were already at least 2 cars ahead of me with their rearends sticking out in traffic.  I ended up parking on a street down aways.  Be careful if you do this, though.  There are signs that tell you where you can't park.",4
Local Flavor,"What a fun event! I just about needed to be rolled out of there after so much dessert. We got to try 4 flavors of gelato (all delicious), nutella croissants (so flaky and delish), several different types of cakes, cupcakes (red velvet, good as always, and hostessesque ones, also delish), cookies, champagne....it was as good as it sounds. We got to walk around the bakery and see all of the equipment was cool.....the walk in freezer was especially cool :-P. Thanks Lindsey and LGO for putting on such an awesome event!",5
Local Flavor,Pastry and sweets lovers dream! I had never been here before and I am so glad I now know about this amazing bakery. I don't even like scones but the blueberry scone I had was to die for! I also loved the red velvet cupcakes and english muffins. I wish I had room to try more! Everything was amazing and there was so much of everything to try. They really went above and beyond. The take home bag was really nice. Lots more sweets and gift cards. I didn't think it was possible for Yelp events to get any more amazing but Lindsay really outdid herself this time!,5

Hey Lindsey won't you look my way
I can go to LGO Bake Shop
Hey Lindsey what you gotta say?
Are you giving me the chance to go

I'm the elite Yelper and this doesn't happen all the time
I found out that everybody yelps
Everybody yelps, everybody yelps

It started with some Gelatos!
And that was when I entered
And then she made baked goods
I could taste the cupcakes
Tell me that you love snacks
DJ Sterlings always gotta backtrack
When everybody yelps back
(Lyrics - Neon Trees - Everybody Talks)

Chef Turner you could bake my cake
Also serve me more rose champagne
Too much could mean a DUI
All these desserts make me hungry

Oh my my Yelp
Everybody yelps, everybody yelps
Everybody yelps too much

It started with some Gelatos!
And that was when I entered
And then she made baked goods
I could taste the cupcakes
Tell me that you love snacks
DJ Sterlings always gotta backtrack
When everybody yelps back

Never really been too LGO....yeah I know what's up with that!?  However their baked shop is awesome!  Sweets sweets and more sweets!  I couldn't eat them all cause they were ""man-sized"" portions!  I was expecting samples, but nope grown-up sized!  I sound like wimp saying this, but wowza; may I have a petite portion please?  Gotta watch my girlish figure!  However, thanks LGO and Chef Turner for showering us with such delicious delight.  

DJ Sterling spinning again and a Yelp proposal!?  Zoinks!  Cough, cough, cough, almost swallowed my cupcakes!  That was awesome and I hope the best for the couple -- congratulations!  

Overall, the line was worth waiting for.  Though it was hot in the kitchen, but you know what they say --- if you can't handle the heat......get a Yelp fan! - Enjoy!",5
Local Flavor,"So I was basically in dessert heaven the minute I walked through the door. =) Goodness what a great event! 

When you first walk in you're already greeted with 4 different types of Gelato to try. I really the regular Greek yogurt and the mint chocolate chip one. Once you go further in, holy crud... talk about desserts beyond desserts! There was everything from cupcakes, to cakes, cookies, muffins, etc. 

I think my favorite was this tres leches cake thing. It was so amazing and it wasn't too sweet. There was also an apricot cake that was also quite delicious and tasty. I also tried the cookies which were spectacular and one of the things I really liked was the giant English muffin! It was so soft and warm and tasty. =) Plus there's nothing like washing it down with the sparkling champagne that they had. I swear, my glass was always filled. lol. =) 

Also to add to the event was the first Yelp proposal! Congrats to the happy couple! 

Everything was so delicious that I was literally in a sugar coma afterwards. As usual, Lindsey did an amazing job putting everything together. Great thanks to Lindsey and LGO for putting this together and having us! =)",5
Local Flavor,"Oh the sugar coma that I just woke up from. Is it possible to be hungover from sugar. So worth it though. This was once again another awesome event. Lindsey rocks as usual. Everything she touches turns to awesome. Thanks to the staff at LGO for hosting us.
It started out a little crazy but once you figured out that the valet parking was complementary everything smoothed out from there. Stand in line for a little bit and then the curtain is pulled back and we are let behind the scenes of the bakery. Right out of the gate BAM here is some gelato. Much need cool treat and a great way to start. Very good. Even the flavors that I would normally not try were good like the peach. So I continue forward happily enjoying my cool treat when I turn the corner and enter the main bakery. Jaw drops and eyes pop out of head. I am six years old again. The room is filled with cakes and cupcakes as far as the eye can see. Then I see a sign with a phrase that I want tattooed on my butt, Cake Makes Everything Better. So true. So so true. I needed to instantly grow two more arms because I wanted to grab one of everything. Little chocolate cake bites, red velvet cupcakes some of the best I have ever had and chocolate Cupcakes a la Hostess but twice as big. I forgot how much I missed these even though these were a 1000 time better.
Everything was so good even the pink champagne. Even a simple croissant was heavenly. Oh don't forget the English muffins. So fresh and fluffy made you feel like you had never eaten a English muffin before in your life.
See what I mean about overload. So much good stuff the sugar coma was so worth it. Great to share it with some good friends and even some new ones. Always the point of a Yelp event to meet new friends. Interesting who you meet in walk-in freezer.
Another great Yelp event that reminds us all why we love Yelp. Back into my sugar coma I go.",5
Local Flavor,"I don't like sweets.

Well, at least not the kind I have had before. LGO has now ruined my waistline with their absolutely amazing baked goods! I live close, which makes this even worse...

This place was unreal...it really was like being a kid in a candy shop. The gelato was fabulous (peach being my favorite). Then...oh then...you turn the corner to see a room FULL of every sweet treat you can imagine! I had no idea where to start, but very easily ended up filling my plate with some of the most beautiful and TASTY items. I must say that I cannot stop thinking about the warm, soft, chewy English muffins made fresh right there. I thought I knew what an English muffin was...boy was I wrong. Why can't they all be this heavenly???

Thank you to Cole who always made sure my glass was full...much appreciated!

This event was spectacular...did anyone else notice that LGO employs some serious eye candy? A treat for my belly and my eyes...who could ask for more??

Bravo!!",5
Local Flavor,"This was my 1st time at La Grande Orange, and what a great way to get familiar with this place by attending the CYME. I have to say when I entered the 2nd room and I saw how big all those yummy treats where I felt like I was Alice in Wonderland and just ate that cake that made me small and was attending a party at the Mad Hatters!  My eyes could not believe the size of the cupcakes, cookies, brownies, danishes & croissants. Oh I just knew I was in sweet heaven!  

I tried so many delicious things, the freshest strawberry Danish with this buttery melt in your mouth crust, the hugest chocolate cupcake, peach, chocolate, vanilla and chocolate mint gelato, and I have to say the chocolate mint was a surprise to me, it had both spearmint & peppermint in the blend. Its hard to pick a favorite on the cookies, but I have to say it's a tie for me, I really enjoyed the oatmeal cranberry raisin cookie and the chocolate chip cookie, both cookies were ligithly sprinkled with salt flakes, salty sweet combos are my favorite and La Grande Orange just took it to a whole other level with these cookies, unbelievably good! :( so heartbreakingly sad now that I have none to eat. And everything went so perfectly well with my pink champaign. But my very favorite item of the night, the English muffins OMG!!! I'm hooked and badly need more! 

Lindsey also saved us Yelpers by handing out the Yelp Fans! After all we all were in a working kitchen, and it was definitely hawt!   

The only words that best describe this evening, indulgence, decadent, delicious. C`est Magnifique!

Thank you Lindsey & Yelp for another great event and many thank yous to La Grande Orange for opening your doors to us and allowing us a sweet taste of bliss!",5
Local Flavor,"I've been to LGO a few times before and knew the parking was terrible - little did I know they had valet parking. Valet was the way to go! As I walked up, I saw tons of patrons inside the pizzeria enjoying their dinner and it looked so good. I couldn't wait to try the sweet treats waiting inside. Upon entrance, I was greeted with four different types of gelato from Grateful Spoon. I was told they hand-make each batch from scratch - they even pasteurize their own milk! There was dark chocolate, greek yogurt, peach, and mint. The dark chocolate was my favorite - it was smooth and tasted how a fine chocolate bar would. The peach was extremely tart. It was good, but I wasn't expecting that. It was really fresh and would be great on a hot summer day. The mint - oh god, it was like a mint explosion in my mouth. I can't tell if I liked it or not - it was excruciatingly minty and sweet. Emily G. said it was like a ""mojito on ...crack"" and I agree. 

As I enjoyed my gelato, I made my way into the back room. I felt like I was at a warehouse unveiling party and getting a peek into something no one has ever seen before. I saw some folks come out with treats and empty plates, but I wasn't expecting the entire space to be jam packed with Yelpers and sweet treats. Oh god, it was sensory overload. The first thing I zeroed in on where the hand made and freshly grilled English Muffins. They were ENORMOUS and HOT. So, so good. I grabbed a blueberry muffin as well, debating over a croissant or scone. I decided I'd have to try those later. Then I wandered past the drink station filled with water and champagne. I wish they had milk - that would have been fantastic to wash down all the treats but champagne was a nice touch.

Then I moved onto the cookie station. Let's just say Cookie Monster would have been in heaven. These cookies were HUGE - like the size of a Frisbee. I grabbed a chocolate/pecan cookie, but all of them looked so good. I had to move on to the cake and cupcake stations. The layered cakes looked so delicious and I am glad they had small servings to try. The chocolate cake with vanilla frosting was my favorite. (I think I know what I'm getting for my birthday!)  I also tried a fluffer-nutter cake sample and the marshmallow crème was delicious! Super fluffy and tasty - definitely a decadent treat. At the cupcake station, I only tried a small chocolate cupcake but it was delicious. 

After this event, I feel like a piñata - stuffed with sweets and ready to burst! I waddled out of this event in a daze with an amazing goodie bag to share. I'm sure the valet guy thought I was delirious or near a diabetic coma, but it was worth it. I am eager to bring others back at a later date to enjoy all the goodies.",5
Local Flavor,"thank you Lindsey and LGO! I am a dessert-lover so this was an AWESOME event for me. my newly discovered favorites from LGO are their tres leches and their peach gelato! I also rediscovered my old favorite: the old-timer cupcake (the one that looks like a huge Hostess chocolate cake) -- literally the best cupcake I've ever eaten!

I thought the proposal was so sweet (no pun intended) and I apologize to Mark and Heather for talking through your proposal, I didn't realize what was happening until people started clapping! I hope someone caught that on camera because that was definitely a moment to remember.",4
Local Flavor,"It was crazy hot that day, but in the back room of La Grande Orange Bake Shop, the woman cooking the English muffins over a superheated griddle was smiling. ""Oh-my-Gosh!!"" my friend says to me ""You have to try one of those. They are amazing. The best English muffins in the world!"" So I grab one and tear it in half so that we can both munch on it. She wasn't exaggerating. Those things are incredible. I love the tangy sourdough flavor. And the bread was so soft and pillowy but at the same time had the right amount of chewiness like a proper English muffin should have. I couldn't believe how they were puffing up like magic on that cook top right before my eyes. We were off to a great start. As we plunged into the crowd we knew it would only get better since there was every kind of baked sweet imaginable available for us to sample. I liked the cake samples the best since they were all full of flavor but very small bite size pieces so that you could eat more than one. Each was very different. I also got a cookie but it was so huge I couldn't finish it. By that time I was stuffed. We grabbed a couple of glasses of champagne but drank them in a hurry since it was super hot and crowded in the main room. Fortunately, they had a separate front room that was made available to us as well and that was pretty cool because of the gelato maker (oh, yeah, did I mention how awesome their gelato is?). Our super amazing and fabulous hostess, Lindsey, had the foresight to bring a whole bunch of Yelp fans and so those helped immensely as well.

We did eventually make our way back to the main room once the crowd had died down and the same smiling woman was there with her exquisite handmade English muffins. ""Here, take one for the road"" she said. So we grabbed some (score!) and then later discovered that we also had some in our goodie bags (double score!). Everything I tasted here was absolutely delicious but I think the thing that impressed me the most about this event was how engaged and friendly the staff at LGO was. The baker at each station was genuinely eager to talk to people about their products as well as the process and ingredients that went into preparing them. It was very interesting and made it quite an experience.

I really wish they sold their baked goods at AJ's or somewhere else closer to home because unfortunately this place is a bit of a drive for me. Fortunately, it is right next door to Postino Arcadia so I think I will have to organize a girls night excursion.... and while I'm there purchase some more of those wonderful English muffins at LGO's bake shop!",5
Local Flavor,"LGO was homeRUN! Like the other reviewers  before me I can't say enough good things about all the sweet indulgences they subjected us to. From the gelato to the super moist Red velvet cake I was amazed! I didn't get to try everything because I refused to pass out from a sugar induced coma but I will say this- that English Muffin was definitely the surprise of the night. I don't think it's possible for bread to taste any better than that dang warm, crispy, chewy English muffin! The LGO staff were super friendly and informative, I love it when a company and its employees can truly take pride in their product. The only reason I had to deduct a star for the event was because it was dreadfully hot due to the ovens being on and the amount of people in the space provided. Plus the parking was a pain in the butt. I can't wait to go to LGO on my own. PS- the gift bags were a nice touch. Great job on another event Lindsey!",4
Local Flavor,"Between the cupcakes, the gelato, the cookies and the incredible english muffins I don't even know where to begin this review.

So I'll just start here - it was awesome!

I had no idea LGO made so many bakery items! My favorites were the cupcakes and the english muffins. Who knew an english muffins could be that good? The two that were in our goodie bags did not last long at our house that's for sure. I think I've found my new addiction.

It was fun to get a ""behind the scenes"" look and taste. I don't know if it was all the sugar but I don't think I've laughed that much in a long time.

Thanks again, Lindsay for a fantastically sweet evening!",5
Local Flavor,"As I walk through the valley of warm-fresh-soft-moist-fluffy english muffins I knew I was in heaven. I put that muffin in my mouth and I felt this warm fluffy sensation of yummyness in my tummy. This was such a great event! I only got a chance to sample their cakes and the cakes were amazingly delicious. Their apricot cake was absolutely my favorite. The fresh mango pieces inside the apricot cake were a pleasant surprise! I ate three pieces and told my fat-self slow down and move onto the tres leches- my second favorite. The tres leches had the right creaminess and moistness- wasn't too sugary either. Their cinnamon swirl buns were also a fantastic treat. The cinnamon bun was crispy on the outside and soft and ""doughy"" on the inside. They also make their gelato in-house which I thought was very cool. Overall I liked that we got to hang out in their kitchen and get a sense of where all the magic happens. The staff was all very polite, friendly, professional, and knowledgeable.  I'm glad I got exposed to this amazing bakery and want to thank Lindsey and LGO bakery for making this happen!",5
Local Flavor,"Amazing event for any sweets lover. When I first walked in, there was a gelato station with mint chocolate, greek yogurt, peach and chocolate flavors. I thought the mint was the best and it had actual mint in the gelato. The peach was also very good and I was told that it was made from fresh peaches.

After gelato tasting, I walked into the back and was greeted by tables of sweets. There were cupcakes of all flavors, cakes, cookies, etc. And all of that served with champagne! In addition, you can see the bakers baking some fresh English muffins for us. Those muffins were huge, fresh and extra soft. One of my favorites was the dumpling pastry which looked like a huge muffin. Upon eating it, it was more like a croissant with jam filling in muffin form... if that makes sense. It was topped with powder sugar and almonds.

We were in the very spot where all the sweets are made so it was very cool to get a glimpse of the baking area. The staff was so nice and everything looked amazing. If you look at the pictures, the food was beautiful. This was a dessert paradise. Too bad I can't eat all that sugar in a two hour span.

The event was awesome and thanks to Lindsey for setting it up. Thanks to LGO staff for the delicious food. I'm so glad I learned of the LGO Bake Shop. I would definitely recommend this place!",5
Local Flavor,"I am finally out of my food coma from Monday.  LOL!!   Wow, this was the place to be.  LGO has yummy everything!  Gelato samples to kick off the sugar coma.  I had apple pastry, mini cupcake, and mini brownie.  I had to stop!!  I was getting dizzy from the sugar...  =)  The muffins smelled so good, but I needed to save room from pizza from next door.  Still in my sugar coma, we got goodie bags with more sweets...  Kudos to Lindsey, Yelp, and LGO.  

Minus 1 star due to the amount of people cramped into a small space.  =(",4
Local Flavor,"Yay to LGO for a wonderful event!  More sweets than one can imagine...big cakes, mini cakes, cookies the size of frisbees, gelato, champagne, and English muffins.  What else do you need?  I did not know what all the hoopla about the muffin was until I had mine from the gift bag the next day.  So much for my 100-calorie multi-grain Thomas English muffins.  And that salted chocolate chip cookie?  I can never again eat a cookie not bathed in salt.

Since I was trying to control myself during the event, I appreciated the gift bag with take-home treats.  They even included gift cards!  I was also thankful my husband had to go out of town on business as he would have taken up space, and the event was a bit too crowded to be fully enjoyed.  I didn't get the chance to talk to the folks at LGO or my fellow Yelpers as much as I would have liked.  That's the only reason I'll go with 4 stars for this one.

I was a little disappointed that I couldn't use my gift cards this morning, though.  English muffins-not included.  Pre-packaged cookies-not included.  They are only good for pastries out of the case.  So I ordered a brownie and a cookie from the case-not included either.  So be sure to ask what constitutes a ""pastry"" before you order.  I ended up just paying for my items, rather than getting things I didn't want or shouldn't have.

But big thanks to Lindsey and LGO for a wonderful event!",4
Local Flavor,"Well what can I say.....yet ANOTHER spectacular YELP event hosted by our AWESOME community manager Lindsey D.....wohooo. The sweet treats were awesome.....and I do mean awesomely delicious....yummy. Everything from the Red Velvet Cupcakes......huge chocolate cupcakes......gluten free and vegan cookies....to the awesome must have ENGLISH MUFFINS was well prepared by the great chef's at La Grande Orange. The Gelato was great as well....so great I bought a pint of Vegan Peach to take home. Truly a spectacular evening except for maybe your waistline....LOL. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!",5
Local Flavor,"*sniff* This was my last CMYE in AZ.

And as usual it was amazing and we were spoiled rotten.

I already loved LGO, but Id never really tried their baked goods. Man, have I been missing out! From the cakes, to the cupcakes which we got to decorate ourselves, to the cookies that were as big as a stack of CDs (remember those?)... Everything was amazing. And those english muffins?! So freakin good.

This event was so worth standing in a hot hot room for. AND there was a proposal!

I had a great time, and from the other review, my fellow Yelpers did as well.

A big thanks to LGO bake shop, and of course Lindsey. Im gonna miss you girl!",5
Local Flavor,"This event was by far my favorite event.  I love sweet and I felt like I was in Heaven with all the deserts. There were cookies, English muffins, cakes, croissants champagne, muffins and gelato.    

LGO and Lindsay did an amazing job with this event.  Everything was incredible and delicious too.  My favorite things of the night were the chocolate filled croissants, apple and chocolate cookies, gelato and the champagne.  

Hope to see you all at the next Yelp Event.",5
Local Flavor,"Walking in LGO the aroma of sweet & savory draws you in! I took a few minutes to glance around at food that customers were enjoying & I wanted to grab a seat, a menu & a tall glass of whatever that gorgeous fruit filled concoction was they were sipping on! 
But  it was time to have dessert for dinner! Gelato to start, the peach was like my tongue jumped into summer, amazing! Even the Greek was perfectly sweet! We were guided into LGO's hot spot where fresh English muffins were baking into soft bites of heaven, surrounded by chocolate crescents, and the best  muffin, but it wasn't just your ordinary muffin it had blueberry swirling inside a light fluffy pillow of fruit filled goodness & whatever they called it I'm going back for more! 
Around every corner and on every table was another tasty treat, from cakes, to cupcakes you could sprinkle yourself,  to enormous soft baked cookies. Everything I tried had the perfect balance of sweetness!
Thank you LGO and thank you Lindsey for a Sweet Event, and for the to go bag, I had some sweet dreams with that under my pillow!",5
Local Flavor,La Grande Orange will always be a favorite place of mine. it may have something to do with the fact that I proposed to my future wife at this event. I'm a fan for life!!!  the English muffins are the best I've ever had and the staff is world class!!,5
Public Services & Government,"If you're visiting you should know the inmates booking number and the only things you can bring with you are a key and an ID.  Also, visiting is over a black and white monitor and phone, no more in person visits.

The ideal candidate for a job with the jail is highly insecure.  The MSCO remedies this insecurity by giving them a badge on their uniform and control over a small population of people who have already been stripped of any rights or privileges- basically powerless.  When you give sad people like that any kind of power, they automatically abuse it because they don't get any respect in their pathetic real lives.

Unfortunately, when you visit someone in jail, you have to interact with these mental midgets.  I've been here to visit someone and they didn't know if they could accept a passport as acceptable identification.  A group of them had to huddle together and weigh in on it before they decided a government issued identification was acceptable.  Another time I came, they said they couldn't let me in because they couldn't find me in their ""system"" which I thought was a good thing.

Most recently though, the Chaplin made a special arrangement for me to see my brother in person when our father passed away.  I didn't ask, he offered.  On my way to the jail I prepared myself for some type of hullabaloo with the dum dums running the visitors station.  Sure enough, as soon as I told them the Chaplin sent me they informed me that the Chaplin doesn't run the Maricopa county sheriffs office.  I reminded him that I never suggested anything as ridiculous as the Chaplin running the sheriffs office but merely that he called me and told me to come see my brother.  After about 20 minutes of talking as slow as possible to 5 different detention officers, I gave up and walked out. It's like they all share one brain and the brain calls in sick all the time.",1
Public Services & Government,"Why review a jail you might want to say,
well cause there are so many things that are just not okay.

Like for example, your cell phone is no good,
DOs won't let you bring it in, though you wish you could.

Be careful with belts, watches and all your bling,
Off they will come if you set off that metal detector thing.

Also, don't expect to see your loved one face to face,
You can see them at other jails, just not at this place.

You only get 30 minutes to visit which could be okay
but you only get to go on Sunday or Monday.

You should also expect delays and even shortened visits,
mostly because DOs can't tell time or count minutes.

Sometimes you wonder and think:
Only 30 minutes in a single week?

Doesn't the MSCO know they have people in there?
that we still love and hold dear?

Well, 30 minutes is gone in no time at all 
especially in that cramped little video stall.

Some might deserve being wrung through the system,
but others are young, sweet and we missed them.

Basic human rights of dignity and nutrition 
are often over looked for the inmates of this institution.

I wish I had better things to say for those that go,
but there's not much good that comes from Sheriff Joe.

Public Services & Government,"One night stay in jail? No sweat! I was out in 6 1/2 hours.

Here are some notes about my experience after getting my first DUI (slightest degree), which required me staying In jail for 10 days, 9 of which were suspended, meaning I needed to spend ONE day in jail.

One day to the jail is to be booked through the end of a 12 hour window (either noon to midnight or vice versa). Don't quote me on that but you'll understand my point of view shortly. I was to spend a day in jail so I thought I would go through self-surrender early in the morning to get out early the next day. I was informed by experiences others to go in late at night instead. I contacted the court (which will cost you $25 to change your incarceration date! - just one more fee...), changed my time to 10pm self surrender and went in that night. 

When arriving, drive yourself if you can afford to (meaning my girlfriend and I share a car but she could survive if I ended up being stuck in jail for 24 full hours so I drove myself). There is free parking right outside the self surrender area. Park yourself, leave all other keys in your car. That way you don't need to give anything up, you can keep it all with you through your stay.
Just stand outside the giant door that says self surrender. They'll come and get you. Take an ID, a paperback book or magazine, and your car key in with you. It gets chilly once you're in the concrete jail for a good amount of time. I wore sweatpants over basketball shorts (in case I got warm) and a t-shirt with a light thermal over top of it and I was fine all evening. Actually took the thermal off and used it as a pillow to get some sleep.
It took about half an hour standing in a room while they did a medical questionnaire with the med staff, got my fingerprints and mug shots taken, got my ""Jail ID"" and was then taken to the holding cell. It was probably 20' by 10' with two wall length concrete benches, one side shorter to accommodate a walled off toilet/sink in the back corner. The people you are with are either other one nighters or people that have served their sentence and are on their way out. Most people will be in pretty good spirits but if you're nervous just take a book and keep you nose in it. IF YOU BRING A BOOK, make it a non novel, something with short chapters or easy stop and go reading, as it's hard to focus with the relentless fluorescent light and talkative inmates. 
Anyway, once I was booked and midnight came, the county got paid for having me as an inmate for 'the day' (2 12 hour periods) as I was incarcerated for the 18th from 9pm-11:59am and the 19th from 12am-3:30am, a portion of each counts as all for their purposes. Once midnight came, they started processing people out. I was re-fingerprinted and moved around to a few more cells but then it was over. You get asked some identifying questions by the sergeant and then you're released. 

DO NOT GET IN YOUR HEAD ABOUT THIS. It will be over before you know it. In summation:
-Reading material: bring a short chapter book, a funny quote book, book of lists, magazine etc
-Personal Belongings: nothing besides clothes on your back, a jacket, single car key and one paper back book or magazine
-Time of surrender: GO IN AT NIGHT or spend unnecessary time in a jail cell
-Interaction: Keep an open mind. You won't be placed with anyone dangerous, but with people on their way out so they will be on their best behavior (mostly) so they can get out of jail.
-Behavior: Listen intently when the officers speak and speak clearly when you speak. They deal with ignorant people all day and usually will have no patience for BS

If you have any other questions or concerns, ask around, do some research, but take everything with a grain of salt. I hope this helps someone at some point. Best of luck, criminal!",1
Public Services & Government,"Well, the landscaping is nice.  There's a large staff to attend to guests at all times, . But it's my understanding accommodations are a little crowded and the meal plan rather limited.  Despite this, the place is clearly a Four Seasons destination and just buzzing with activity all the time and nenver seems to be suffering from a shortage of guests, but then the place doesn't appear to be particularly exclusive either.  Apparently they let practically anybody in there. Note that the check- out process can be a rather drawn out procedure sometimes requiring 90 days or more, so if you are departing by taxi, you might want to tell them to not start the meter until you are in the car.",3
Public Services & Government,"This review is only applicable for people on a 1 day sentence... I've not had the opportunity to be a long term resident.

I was sentenced one day for reckless driving. If you are about to have to do this, don't sweat it. Yeah it sucks, but you can handle it. 

First, you need to go in at night, like schedule your time for 9 or 10 pm.  This is really important. If you do this you will most likely be released early the next morning.  I got there at 10pm and was completely out by 9am, but I have heard people have gotten out as early as 3 or 4am. If report there in the morning, you WILL be there all day and into the next morning.

I have heard opinions on what day of the week to go in, most say you could be in there longer if you go on a weekend because they're trying to process more people, but if you go on a slow day they could be in no hurry to get you out of there. I went on a Thursday which was recommended by my attorney and I was out in 11 hours. The day of the week is probably kind of a toss up because it depends on how many people they are getting in from downtown and processing to court.

Another important reminder, don't forget to bring a towel!  You will not be showering, but this will give you something to sit on softer than cement. You are allowed to bring 2 towels.

After finger prints, mugshot, medical questions, and some signatures, you'll be moved to a cell. You will be in a 'tank' or medium sized cell for the duration of your stay. It consists of two long concrete benches and a jail toilet. You will not be processed into the tents on a one-day sentence.  You cell mates will be people doing the same thing as you, or people being processed in and out of the system. There is a fairly large population of guards and a lot of people being moved from cell to cell all night, so I don't think anyone's going to fuck with you in here. I mean if you're a real dick you're probably going to get your ass kicked, but then I'm sure you're used to it by now.  

You may get moved once or twice to different cells. Don't let moving get your hopes up that you're about to get out. They're just reorganizing.

I would definitely eat before, but not something that will make you have to use the shitter.  Hydrate because the water tastes like ass, and in my cell only the hot water worked.

So anyway, bring a book, a watch, a towel, and be mentally prepared to just sit and wait. Hear some stories and meet some funny & weird ass people! You'll be fine!",1
Restaurants,"The California omelette was huge, very filling. The hashbrowns were krispy and not smothered with butter.  Food took a little long to come out, but was definitely worth the wait. This is so close to us that we will be revisiting often.",4
Restaurants,"Ate here 2 times for breakfast.   Not sure why they have omelette in the name?   The omelette I had was overcooked and rubbery.   It was as though they pre-made them and tried to microwave them before serving (you know, when it's SO HOT in the middle of the omelette? You can't help but suspect microwaving).   

No.  Stop now.  Turn around, go hit McDonalds if you have to - just don't go here!

EDIT 7/15/16:  This place is no longer in business (gee wonder why?).",1
Restaurants,"I came into Ollies this morning and ordered a custom made chorizo omelet. While eating the omelet, i noticed that there were several raw pieces on my plate. I brought this to the servers attention who immediately took my plate to go show her boss. When she came back she said it was pieces of ""tendon"". It was very obvious that it was raw meat. Not only did the manager not come to our table to explain and apologize, but she refused to take it off the bill. I will be filing a formal complaint with the health department and will not be going back to Ollies ever again.  Do Not Eat Here!",1
Restaurants,"We recently purchased a condo in Sun City, Arizona, as a home base for my husband to obtain medical treatment via the Mayo Clinic and Banner Boswell Hospital's Rehabilitation program, so we have slowly began exploring the various recreation centers available to us.  During one of visits to the Bell Recreation Center, we discovered Memo's Bistro, and are we ever pleased.  

Memo's Bistro is located inside the building that houses the bowling, billards, and indoor shuffle-board courts.  Easy access to the restaurant is located at the back side of the buildings, where there is also free covered parking beneath the newly installed solar system panels.  

It was afternoon when we arrived at the restaurant, but the friendly waitress assured us we could order breakfast anytime, so I ordered the ""sweet potato pancakes.""  You see I've never encountered sweet potato pancakes in a restaurant, or any place else, in my entire life and my parents were raised in the South where sweet potatoes are a staple.  

To my great surprise, the pancakes were a culinary thrill.  Light, and ever so tasty.  Not sure I'll ever want a regular pancake again.  

Our entire dining experience was excellent, from the good tasting food, to excellent/friendly service, to the clean and welcoming interior.  All menu items were reasonably priced and check-out was easy.  

We will return to Memo's Bistro in the future, as I can't wait to order the sweet potato pancakes again.  Yummy!",5
Restaurants,"Memo's took over the former La Petite Café in the Bell Rec Center building.  We have eaten there several times, and the food has always been good, though the menu is fairly limited.  The owner/manager (Christie) has always been very friendly and talkative and greets each customer individually.  She runs a tight ship as to service.  Our only poor experience was one Friday when she was not there and the two girls running the place took forever to serve the customers .  We waited 25 minutes for a simple dinner order and another 20-25 to get a takehome box and the bill.  Other than that one instance, whenever Christie is there, things are run well and the dining experience is excellent.
The restaurant is quite small (only seats about 40-50 people, and is located by the bowling alleys in the rec center, so it can get crowded at times, but we have always been able to get in.
We live quite close so we eat there often.",4
Restaurants,"A group of 20 of us had an excellent Sunday Buffet Breakfast this morning.  Began with an Omelette station. The Chef was Rock N Rolling using 3 omelette pans at a time. The omelette was fluffy and delicious.  Also, choice of bacon, sausage, hash browns, biscuits & gravy. Chicken Fajitas, assorted pastries, fresh fruit salad, and deserts. Service was very good.
I believe price was $9.99.
We will definitely be back..
Job well done!",4
Restaurants,"We found the perfect place for Friday fish fry at Memo's Bistro. The fish was delicious with an awesome batter. The potatoes and coleslaw were exactly how we like them. Our server Kaitlyn kept our plates and beverages full. Price was very fair. We'll be back each Friday. Sincerely, Karen &  Art (Karts) Huseonica, Sun City",5
Restaurants,"Had breakfast there this morning.  Ordered 2 scrambled eggs, hashbrowns & bacon.  The bacon was not eatable.  I tried 1 piece but couldn't stand the taste. 2 eggs was more like 1.  Sourdough toast was good.   Staff was friendly and attentive even though they were very busy.  There were at least 2 tables of 15+ each.",2
Restaurants,"Memos is a common breakfast spot for us. We LOVE the sweet potato pancakes, so delicious. We have never had poor service or food. If there for lunch I'm likely to get the tuna melt, one of the best I've had.",5
Local Flavor,"EdTwestival was a fantastic event last night. Of course I'm a bit biased but I do think the Yelp Cake Stall stole the show having a prominent location near the stage, gorgeous decorations (Alice in Wonderland theme couldn't have been pulled off better!) and of course stunning cakes. The cakes not only were beautifully decorated but were also scrumptious, and there was a huge selection that was all generously donated. Since all the money raised went to charity to support the Yard's great work, the stall couldn't have been better.

The cake stall aside, EdTwestival had lots going on with many fun and different games, stage acts including live bands and comedy, a beer tasting with Harviouston and a large bar serving local beer (Barney's couldn't be more local brewed right at Summerhall). Although the area sometimes looked a bit sparse, many people also enjoyed the sunny evening outside. Hopefully the next EdTwestival will have an even bigger turnout!",4
Local Flavor,"Great show at last nights #EdTwestival The highlight for me was meeting people who I've been chatting to here on Yelp and also on Twitter.

I have to say that the Yelp cake stand was out of this galaxy amazing. Down the rabbit hole and you've found the cakes, oh the cakes! I had 4 maybe 5 different ones throughout the course of the evening and I must admit, better baking you couldn't find. For me, like Tanya L mentioned it stole the show.

It looked slightly empty at times as people spilled outside and in to other rooms, but at one point I did a head count and there was well over 90 people there. The room simply was too big which made the crowd seem small.

That aside, good chat, beer from local brewers and cake from local guys and gals - what more can a man ask for other than more please!",4
Local Flavor,"""Quartier des Spectacles, a must in Montreal !""

Since 2009, Quartier des Spectacles is a new neighborhood, where you come to see live free concerts/festivals outside all year long (FrancoFolies in June /// Jazz Festival in June/July /// Montréal Complètement Cirque in July /// Just for Laughs in July /// Présence Autochtone in August /// World Film Festival in August/September /// Luminothérapie in December/January /// Montreal High Lights in February/March /// Les Rendez-vous du cinéma québécois in February) you have many restaurants/cafés/bars  (Bouillon Bilk /// Brasserie T! /// Taverne F /// Bistro Le Balmoral /// biiru /// Furco /// Café Parvis /// Café Saint-Henri /// Pandore /// Mme Lee /// Pub L'île noire). You have many buildings & spaces included into Quartier des Spectacles (Places des Arts /// Places des Festivals /// Promenade des artistes /// Le Parterre /// Place de la Paix /// Place Émilie-Gamelin & Place Pasteur in Quartier Latin /// La Vitrine culturelle inside Le 2-22). Quartier des Spectacles has a red lightning signature + architectural video projections on many buildings & spaces. There is more projects to come in the future but so far, it's a nice quality addition in my opinion for the city of Montreal. Good for international tourists but as well of course for Montrealers. Free wifi in many locations. Enjoy !

5/5 visited since 2009.",5
Local Flavor,A great way to end a night! The place look beautiful with the lights and the glowing swings. We had a lot of fun making music on the swings!,5
Local Flavor,"What is that? A light festival in Montreal :o let me get my bus ticket and commence the 300 mile ride. Montreal en lumiere exemplifies what it's suppose to represent. A winter light festival that celebrates the arts, fun activities, family showing, music, food and many more. I'm lucky to have enjoyed 3 and a half days of this. It started with the awe inspiring sight on Thursday night upon arriving montreal. I went on the sled slide which is beyond an adrenaline   rush. It was cool that they have roasting areas for marshmallows and sausage. There's a really cool illuminated Ferris wheel that I regret not going :/ not only that but ziplines, beverage and food area. Igloos, hello kongzi, and lots and lots of bright lights :) well worth the sight, especially if you love to have fun, dance, take pictures and enjoy festivals.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"La maison de la culture du Plateau, que j'adore parce qu'elle est, entre autres, en face du métro Mont-Royal (et donc archi-accessible), est aussi un lieu excellent où se produire en tant qu'artiste, des arts de la scène à l'exposition.

Tous les événements y sont gratuits!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Great venue for dance, live music,theatre , storytelling,and shows especially for children. Art gallery focused on works by local artists and photographers,library half has larger selection of French books as opposed to English,but this is afterall,predominantly a Francophone neighbourhood. Glad I had the chance to catch this last performance before the holidays,glad to come back to one of my fave maisons de la culture.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I've experienced some great visual and performance art here! This past Sunday, I attended a show of traditional Ottoman empire music, performed live by some amazingly talented musicians, and it was FREE! Just phenomenal. I've also wandered in randomly and caught some excellent art exhibits in the main gallery (ground floor). Also, free entry to the gallery. 
I've not been into the library yet, but it seems cozy, well-stocked and spans a couple of floors. Maybe the next time I need a quiet, contemplative escape. 

Stop in and see what happens - dare you.",4

Public Services & Government,"Magnifique bâtiment années 80, dont la merveilleuse façade multicolore procure de multiples points de vue d'intérêt sur la ville.
A l'intérieur, très judicieuse utilisation du béton, et les espaces intérieurs sont très travaillés.
Les boutiques alimentaires qui mènent à la station de métro sont très pratiques.
Pour l'aspect plus pratique des salons, n'ayant pas testé, je serai bien en peine de donner un avis motivé:)",4
Public Services & Government,"Came to an event held here (Krugman and Rogoff debate). Venue setup was very good: great use of projectors in a room w many guests - not all of whom could easily see the stage. Aside from that: things were ok. Food: ok but if never pay for it. Service: friendly. Cocktail beforehand: will skip in the future.

Overall: satisfied and willing to come again so long as actual event (I.e., content) is enticing. That's kind of what you want, right? The venue enables but does not lead the show.",3
Local Flavor,"Unfortunately this is a quick review.  I didn't get to spend as much time here as I had wanted to besides walking through it twice on my way back to the hotel.  Both times I was impressed, however, with the selection of stores and the diversity of the neighborhood.  

I saw a little tea place that I really want to try and is definitely on my list for next time...",3

Touristiquement, aucun intérêt (4 portes au dessus d'une avenue, des restaurants et boutiques asiatiques).
Commercialement, pourquoi pas si vous avez besoin de fruits exotiques ou autres denrées typiques.

Local Flavor,"It's small.  It's full of tourists, and as such doesn't really feel alive.  It closes up at 10pm.  Some of the restaurants say they're open until 11, but walk in after 10 and you'll be told that the kitchen is closed, and out you go.  I don't know what sort of bylaws Montreal has going, but if a China Town isn't even open until midnight (or say, 4am) I don't know what's going on.

Take a picture of the gate, and then be on your way.  Maybe try the Dragon Beard's candy, just for a lark.",2

Local Flavor,"if you've never set foot in a chinatown before, this one may be the best thing ever but for a local, this is pretty craptastic! worse if you've visited other bigger and better chinatowns.

it does get lively during chinese new year celebration but other than that, it feels dead. sure, its buzzing with tourists and locals during the day but its just traffic. noisy traffic.

as for stores and restaurants, depending on what you're looking, its either fucking stupid cheap or my wallet is safe thank you very much.

how many pho joints and bubble tea places do one need? apparently, a lot. i've never seen so much of them in a block radius than here..

but times seem to be changing now with new entries that bring a different feel to the neighborhood by offering something than what we're used to.",3
Local Flavor,"While walking through Montreal we found ourselves in Chinatown which was a pleasant surprise. Since we were new to the city we didn't know what to expect, but this Chinatown had all the basics.

We ended up stopping at a few different bakeries in the village and enjoyed walking past a few of their shops and restaurants. The only issue we had was that we arrived later in the evening when some of the shops were closed, but overall we enjoyed the stores were were able to visit.

One tip, parking can be a bit tough so take a bus or train if you can!",3

Educational, Fun, and phobia curing. 

I got to go to two different shows. One at an elementary school where it was a hands on, learning experience.

You also get the option of doing a few fear factoresque challenges, like worm eating, bug eating, and getting bugs put all over you. Granted it is a choice, but boy is it fun to watch people do it. 

I then went to the Peoria Halloween Show and held animals I didn't even know existed. Skinks, dragons, and then all sorts of snakes, reptiles, and they seem cuddly and cute after you learn all about them.",5

Restaurants,"Re: teriyaki chicken - The ""chicken"" included several wholly inedible chunks, the rice was undercooked, there was not enough sauce, and the ""stir-fry"" vegetables consisted of raw onion strips and the flavorless bottoms of lettuce leaves. Absolutely horrible. Would give zero stars if possible.",1
Restaurants,Short line wait. Helpful order taker who actually listened to whatbi did not wantbin my spicy chicken. It was hot and spicy hot which I liked but not enough sauce so I had to go back and get more which took 4 minutes-not happy about that part of dinner.

Public Services & Government,"As Cassandra pointed out in her review, the staff working at this passport office are really great people! Smiling, friendly and most importantly helpful! I had issues with my pictures, and the clerk serving me gave me different options on what I could do, and stressed I wouldn't have to take a number again regardless of the option I chose (hurrah!).  She also gave me a bit of perspective: sure, it was annoying that my picture would 99% be refused so she was giving me the option to just have it redone to spare the waiting around, but I wouldn't have to do it for another 10 years.

I didn't need my new passport for any special reason other than the fact that I was 6 months away from the current passport expiring, and nonetheless the turnaround time was quick! I received my new passport in the mail less than a week after I sent in my new pictures (because of issues with getting my pictures accepted). 

Another awesome thing about the passport office is that they open early. I arrived at 7:30 not knowing they started giving numbers at 7, and I was still in and out in just over half an hour. That's service!",4

Restaurants,"If you're spending the day at the castle, you're probably going to need something to eat. There are two restaurant/café locations on the grounds (and you aren't allowed re-entry on your tickets...we checked).

We chose the Redcoat Café because they had several items on offer, and it seemed more casual than the table-service restaurant across the compound. As you walk in, you're face-to-face with several different options, but directly in front of the door sits the sweets bar. Devious placement on their part, and it totally worked on me. I went in seeking savory nourishment, and walked to my table with a piece of cake added on. Figures.

The café offers both grab-and-go cold sandwich offerings and hot entrées. We went with the hot entrée - a haggis, neeps and tatties pie, which was served with fries and potatoes (overload on starch, lemme tell ya!)

The dining area is quite large, so we had no issues finding a table. At that time, though, all the ""good"" tables - the ones with the spectacular views of the city - were all taken.

Oh - tip! If you want water with your meal, and don't mind tap, don't buy bottled. They have a pitcher of tap water and a bucket of ice on a table near the silverware, which you can get for free.

The food was pretty good, though very filling. I wasn't kidding when I said the meal we decided on was starch overload - we had potatoes three ways. But, it was filling, it stuck to our ribs and it gave us energy to finish out the day at the castle.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"Ein toller Golfplatz, der sich da in einem ehemaligen Hofgut befindet. Alles ist sehr gepflegt und liebevoll angelegt. Die zahlreichen Bedienungen im Restaurant sind sehr aufmerksam und freundlich und auch bei Hochbetrieb immer schnell zur Stelle.
Mit das Wichtigste sind natürlich die Golfbahnen. Was mir sehr gut gefallen hat, ist das durchdachte Anlegen der einzelnen Bahnen. Wenn man bei gut 38°C mit etwa 100 Teilnehmern einTurnier spielt kommt es oft zu Verzögerungen. Bei fast jedem Abschlag findet man ausreichend Schatten und Sitzgelegenheiten für einen 4er-Flight. Sehr angenehm auch die beiden Wasser-Auffüllstationen.
Da hat jemand mitgedacht!
Es gibt Golfplätze, da hat man das Gefühl, man kann an jeder Stelle alle 18 Loch überblicken. Hier hat man eher das Gefühl, man ist allein unterwegs. Sehr gute Anlage mit geschickter Platzierung des Busch- und Baumbestandes inkl. große Biotope und einigen Wasserhindernissen. Hier macht Golfen Spaß!

Restaurants,"I visited Itchycoo this afternoon with the lovely Julie G and we had a lovely afternoon, so much so that we stayed and chatted in the lounge for several hours whilst savouring our afternoon tea and cocktails. I love the tradition of afternoon tea, and it is always fantastic to indulge in an afternoon of eating sandwiches, scones, and cakes. Itchycoo has taken the afternoon tea to a new level by letting you bypass the actual tea (or coffee) and skipping directly on to the cocktails. This is a fantastic idea (hey, if you're going for a decadent afternoon filled with cake, why not go all the way and get a cocktail, too!). 

Itchycoo's cocktail list was lovely, and I couldn't decide between the Death by Chocolate or the Espresso Martini. The waiter helped me decide on the Death by Chocolate cocktail - it was fabulous, rich and decadent and definitely fit what I was looking for!

After the cocktails arrived, our cake tower was paraded out to us. It was a beautiful array and selection. I think it's a general feature that the sandwiches at an afternoon tea are usually a let-down. The vegetarian versions we had were fine, but nothing stood out. We then moved on to the scone tier. The scones were tasty, but could have been a bit more fluffy and fresh. Itchycoo did very well with the cakes, though, which are always meant to steal the show anyway (let's face it). We had a banoffee pie, a fruit pie, meringues and carrot cake. I liked them in that order, too, with the meringues and the carrot cake both being fabulous. I was a tad disappointed that there was nothing chocolate included in the cake range, but then again my Death by Chocolate cocktail helped make up for that!

We really enjoyed sitting by the lovely windows in the lounge rather than in the dark bar area. However,  since we opted to sit farther away from the bar we were a bit neglected by service and had to ask three times for some tap water. However, that could have been because of the location we chose. Still, I wasn't thrilled in the service because I had originally made the reservation for 3pm but then tried to move it later to 4pm but was told that they were completely booked out for afternoon that afternoon so weren't able to let us come later. This was disappointing, especially because the whole time we were there it was extremely quiet with plenty of space at other tables, so they easily could have accommodated us an hour later. The online service was excellent, though, because the Radisson Bleu Edinburgh's social media people are really on it and were excited to have us come (as they should be!).",4
Restaurants,"Itchycoo is a restaurant bar with a new food menu that focuses on fresh local produce. We started with deep-fried softshell crab and a mixed salad (featuring dried cranberries, walnuts, and blue cheese). For mains (which we both particularly enjoyed) it was pan fried sea bass and rump of lamb. Dessert was a dark chocolate tartlet and something called ""munch"" (which turned out to be many little tasty desserty things on a plate). 

Many items on the menu can be ordered as either main or starter portions, which I thought was a lovely idea. I ended up having 2 starter-sized portions (for both courses), and it was more than enough to fill me up.

Oh, and they have a lot of cocktails. The cocktails, which are well-done classics for the most part, are about average-priced for the city. I've tried several, and I think the raspberry mojito is my favorite so far. 

Service was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, if a tad slow at times. 

Disappointments: 
1) None of the vegetarian mains looked particularly exciting (though to be fair, I haven't tried them - perhaps they are absolutely thrilling to eat).
2) No local beers on tap. Would love to see these added someday - I could definitely see us spending a sunny afternoon at one of their outdoor tables on the Royal Mile sipping beer and people-watching.",4
Restaurants,"Really disappointing afternoon tea. Between two people we had 9 stale white bread sandwiches (cheese and pickle, ham and tomato, salmon) two dry tasteless supermarket style cupcakes, 2 tasty banoffee pies, two sticky ginger cakes and 2 mini macarons. Oh and some clotted cream and jam for the scones we didn't have. I think we were given extra sandwiches because of this but really there's only so much stale bread u can eat! Both our 'hot' drinks were cool. 
Even at our groupon voucher price it was a poor show",1
Local Flavor,"Ich kann mich den ""vorrednern"" auf Englisch nur anschliessen. Ein sehr schöner Platz um sich aus dem Trubel auszuklinken und sich ein kleines Picknick zu genehmigen. Dazu der Ausblick auf die Burg. Super",5
Local Flavor,"I always think it's bizarre that the main street in Edinburgh only has shops on one side of the street. The other side has the jaw-droppingly stunning view of Prince Street Gardens, with Edinburgh Castle keeping a watchful eye high above on the rocks, and railway lines running right through the bottom of the valley. There can be no other place quite like it.


 It's especially pretty at the height of summer, but it's gorgeous when the gardens are covered in snow too.


 If you visit Edinburgh, it's a must see. Don't be like us local people who often take it for granted.",5
Local Flavor,"When I was child, I would go to this garden with my first gf back in highschool and ""hold hands and make out"" (aww....) under a tree (no joke!). 

It's under the Castle and right next to Edinburgh Train Station. 

Edinburgh has many beautiful greens and this one is very nice. It's right next to Princes Street, so you can rest & have a nice lunch or picnic when are tired of window shopping.",5
Local Flavor,This is a great place to relax for mabye a picnic or just relaxing after your big long shop on princess street.It offers great views to the castle.,4
Local Flavor,"Spectacular!  It's so green here, and it's a great place to relax between shopping, eating, and sightseeing.  You also get a great view of these gardens from the top of the castle!",5
Local Flavor,"Princes Street Gardens is a calm, peaceful getaway from the crowded Princes Street which is over run with buses, tram works and shoppers. On a sunny day this is the perfect place to have a picnic and just relax. 

You can sit on the benches or the grass and watch the tourists trample by, the kids (young and old) playing, the young lovers humping on the grass... Oh wait you don't want to see that, but you probably will as sometimes people forget they are in the middle of a bustling city. When working on Princes Street during the summer I looked forward to my lunch break where I would grab some food from Marks and Sparks and sit enjoying my surroundings in the gardens. You can admire the view of the castle and the fantastic buildings in the Old Town which overlook the Gardens.

Princes Street Gardens is that little slice of tranquility in an otherwise crowded and noisy city.",4
Local Flavor,"This is one of my favourite places to be in Edinburgh when it's a nice day. Even if it's not a particularly sunny day, I still love strolling through the gardens. I always cut through from market street to the galleries in the Garden as it cuts back foot-traffic and it's just a nice place to be!

However, there has been more than one occasion where I've felt intimidated by large groups of teenagers experimenting with their eye-liner and hair-dye. They all seem to hang around the gates so it looks frightening when you're walking in...but within 2 minutes you can't even hear them and you're left in peaceful bliss! It's so easy to forget that you're in the centre of Scotland's capital, it is so beautiful. If I'm out shopping on Princes St I always grab a sandwich and eat on one of the benches in the Gardens. It's lovely!",4
Local Flavor,"Despite living so close to the Meadows, the place to be when the sun comes out in Edinburgh - I would rather be here, in Princes Street Gardens.

Firstly, its much quieter, but being so close to Princes Street, its a lot more ecclectic in its users (rather than the student biased Meadows) and there are a lot more things like ice cream vans etc. Whats more, you will always have the feeling of being in a local park, its so relaxing and fun. People playing frisbee, reading even sleeping in the sunlight, its really a joy.

But that isnt the reason I come here - its the view - that stunning view, ranging from the Balmoral Hotel and the bridges on your left - all the way to the castle on your right. Its mind blowing.",5
Local Flavor,"I don't care what anyone else says, this is by far the most beautiful shopping street I have ever seen. Yes, so on rainy/snowy days it's a bit annoying having to put your brolley up every time you venture out of one shop and into another, but where else can you have capital city quality shopping on one side of the street, and a huge big grassy park and views of the gorgeous Edinburgh Castle on the other?

Along the main street itself, you'll find all the usual big high street names like Gap, Topshop, Boots, Waterstones, The Body Shop etc and if it's a department store you're after ther's one at each at AND one in the middle (although Jenners is my favourite of the 3). 

The best thing about Princes Street though, is that it's designed in blocks like in America. It's on these little streets that cut across it every 50 metres or so that all the functional/boring day-to-day things like banks, newsagents and estate agents are - which means there's more room along the Princes Street itself for the good stuff.

That said, there is one really, really, annoying thing about Princes Street (aside from the snow issues already mentioned): although it's lovely and beautiful with all the old Georgian and late Victorian architecture, it does mean that the shops are quite small and so most of the bigger ones have two or sometimes even three branches spread along this one street. The amount of times you'll be on autopilot and accidentally go to the wrong H&M for what you need, only to have to trudge what seems like a mile back along the road to the other branch, it's more than a bit of a pain.",4
Local Flavor,"When New Town was being built you have to admit they were quite clever about a number of things.
 Princes street is one of them: with shops only allowed to be built on one side (and particularly the sunny side- whenever the sun is out) and leaving the opposite side as a public path with an unobstructed view of the Castle makes shopping quite enjoyable. Granted the recent tram line works have caused a lot of obstruction and the modern shop fronts have ruined the New Town architecture of the 1800s this is certainly a quite original shopping street. It has primarily big clothes chains and  department stores (such as Debenhams and Jenner's ) with the occasional Boots, Body Shop or HSBC thrown in. 

Here's a fun geeky fact for you: Princes street actually is for the plural of prince rather than Princess street which it is frequently confused for. 
There are a lot of buses coming up and down going to all corners of Edinburgh, so it's quite a good central spot for some strolling around shopping. If however, outdoor walking is not your thing you might be better off at one of the larger department stores located out of Town.",4
Local Flavor,"Firstly, lets avoid the nasty business of the trams that are being installed onto princes Street - no matter who you ask, you'll just end up with a disgruntled mumble. So lets avoid it all together.

So, you can keep your Oxford Street and your Bond Street,  London. Give me Princes Street in Edinburgh any day. 

What makes Princes Street so special? Is it the huge number of shops - everything from world famous department stores such as Jenners, to modern and new shops such as Urban Legend - as well as everything in between? Or is it the fact that while on one side there are some of the best shops around, and on the other is a simply breathtaking view of the Castle and Princes Street Gardens? 

In my opinion, it could be both.",5
Local Flavor,"Princes Street's retail scene tends to come in for a bit of a knocking from the press, somewhat unfairly. Admittedly some of the shopfronts look a bit tired, the stores are a bit small, and it can't quite compete with Oxford Street or even Buchanan Street, but for a street with only one side, I'd say it does exceptionally well.

The shop side isn't really Princes Street's main draw though, as looking over the old town and castle surely highlights this as one of the most picturesque and unique main streets of any city, anywhere. Walking down this street from West to East, with the Balmoral in full view, should be on any tourists tick list, and I still enjoy it despite having done the trek hundreds of times.",5
Local Flavor,"Princes Street is the centre of Edinburgh and is a shopaholics heaven. Lined with all the normal High Street stores, you will find plenty to spend your hard earned cash on. With the castle and gardens on the other side, it really is the perfect shopping street. Retailers must hate not being able to close Princes Street shoppers into a trap of High Street stores, instead they can wander off into the gardens. 

Pretty much all the bus routes in Edinburgh converge on Princes Street so it is accessible and will send you off in whatever direction you need to go in. 

Downside is the tram works. But that's another story for another day.",5
Local Flavor,"Princes Street is a fab High Street and it is home to many of my favourite shops; Whittard of Chelsea, Superdrug and a huge Topshop to name a few. I really could spend hours in the Topshop here, it's incredible! It's also home to the infamous Jenners.

On top of all of the shops it's has a stunning view of Edinburgh Castle and it's only a stones throw from the train station - perfect!

The main downside is trying to cross Princes Street, it's choc-a-block with cars and buses so I usually play it safe and wait for the trusty old green man. I think I've lost a few of my nine lives running across it before.",5
Local Flavor,"With the backdrop of Edinburgh castle and well kept flora, Prices Street Gardens is an ideal parallel to the to the, at times, busy and congested shopping district of Edinburgh.

Catch the gardens on a sunny day and you'll find it attracts a variety of people young and old, a interesting mix of activity (the occasional performing arts demonstration), and all round pleasant atmosphere.

Ideal for sprawling out on the grass verges with your lunch, staring up towards the castle perched on its towering rock formation.",4
Local Flavor,"A sea of green tranquility in the heart of Scotland's capital, Princes St gardens is magical all year round.

With its glorious blooming flower beds, freshly cut grass and the central ornate, classical gold fountain (arguably its crowning glory), Prices St gardens offers an oasis of calm in the middle of Edinburgh's hustling high streets.

The gardens were erected in the Victorian era and still exude the air of wealth and showiness that encompassed the old grand tour culture. They are pretty, well maintained and thus play hosts to many Fringe and Festival events, not to mention the world famous Hogmanay stage. The gardens are especially stormed during these seasons, and performers are glorified in the gorgeous surroundings.

During the winter the gardens host a winter wonderland which is absolutely magical. You can expect to see a busy marketplace selling food and candy canes, not to mention Icelandic reindeer! But even though the gardens are remarkable on these occasions, they still offer a wonderful space to lounge around on during the quieter months, not to mention hosting a cafe. They even have the permanent fixture of a carousel should you get carried away with yourself after a wee coffee!

Beautiful all year round, Princes St gardens truly is a park for all seasons.",5
Local Flavor,"As a fully-fledged, loud and proud misery guts, I tend to prefer it when it's grey and drizzly rather than beaming down with sunshine. To that end, I'm maybe not the best person to commentate on Prince's Street Gardens, but regardless of my dislike for sunshine, it's very beautiful and has cracking views over the castle and some of Edinburgh's other grand buildings.

It's still no excuse to take your top off, guzzle cider and chuck a frisbee about as soon as the thermometer hits 20.",4
Local Flavor,"Princes Street is one of the most iconic, unieque high streets in the world. Where else can you shop till you drop with an ancient castle looming over you on the horizon?

The shopping side of Princes Street is made up of high street components. Although the vast majority of the stores can be found on any high street or mall in the UK (and occasionally beyond), they are all well kept outlets set in gorgeous Georgian and Victorian buildings. If you care to look away from the bright lights of River Island for a second, the architecture is absolutely stunning on most of these buildings.

For over a mile. Princes Street stretches on, and is probably the most straightforward of all town centres to navigate since you don't have to veer up any side streets. If you choose to there are some lovely ones, but if you just fancy a high street blitz, it's all there for you. You can't possibly get lost, and even if you do achieve the impossible there will be plenty of locals around to help you out.

Facing out over the glorious Princes St Gardens, castle and Wallace Monument, it is a momentous occasion walking down this street for the first time. The mixture of old and new is breathtaking, and with shops as different as Jenners and Topshop it makes for a fine day shopping.",4
Local Flavor,"Edinburgh isn't exactly known for its shopping. Infact, if I need to go shopping I'll get the train to Glasgow, because they have more selection and Primark! Being a student, Primark is important. There have been a few rumours that Primark will be opening in Edinburgh Princes St too, and I've seen the signs myself but nothing seems to happen!

Princes st has a great selection of shops though. Jenners at one end and House of Fraser at the other, you're just as well to spend the day in here. There is Topshop, H&M (two of them), Office, All Saints, Urban Outfitters and many, many more. Yeah it all looks good on paper, ut in reality it's a total nightmare trying to walk along the street. It's wide enough, so you would think there wouldn't be much of a problem, but my God I've wanted to punch a few people here. It gets too busy, simple! If you're not stuck behind the slowest people on the planet, you're stuck on a collision course with someone wanting money from you.

Although the shops are brilliant, I hate shopping on Princes Street because I have a very short fuse when it comes to being stuck behind  slow people or trying to thread my way through crowds! The solution is simple though - cross the road and walk on the other side!",3
Local Flavor,"Princes Street gets quite a bit of stick for being an unattractive mish mash of shopping outlets, however, I think that pales into significance really when you weigh it up with the fact you have a view of Edinburgh Castle and Princes Street Gardens while you shop. There will also soon (perhaps using the word soon is tempting fate slightly) be the scene of the much awaited, and equally whinged about Edinburgh trams whizzing up and down the street.

Princes Street is definitely pretty legendary, and even if it hasn't got the classy good looks of its neighbour, George Street, it does give you all the High Street retail options you would hope to find on one stretch of road. I always underestimate how long it takes to get from one end of Princes Street to the other, as it's actually a pretty lengthy street, even if it doesn't seem it sometimes. Walking down Princes Street during the Christmas period is the best, as I'm a massive fairly light and Christmas decor aficionado, so absolutely love gazing like some sort of festive elf at all the pretty lights streamed over Princes Street Gardens.",3
Local Flavor,"Never mind signing up for the gym, just go for a day's shopping on Princes Street as it's always sure to burn up a week's worth of calories.  It easily takes 20 minutes to walk from one end to the other and you'll always find yourself wandering into shops you hadn't intended buying anything from.  It has all the High Street main outlets from Jenner's and Slater's to Topshop and HMV.  
For the last year the council have been creating all kinds of hell for pedestrians by taking the best part of a lifetime to install some tramlines.  Assuming they ever manage to complete the project, the trams should actually be pretty handy, especially if you plan to spend a whole day in the area.  
Whether the trams work out or not, Princes Street will remain an excellent, centralised place to get just about anything.",5
Local Flavor,"Initially I dismissed Princes Street Gardens as a way of filling space - a bit of lawn and a few shrubs, but this was for two reasons: firstly I saw it in winter and secondly because I was wrong.  

Seeing these gardens in summer is an absolute delight.  In my past I've worked as a gardener, visited some truly exceptional gardens and I have to say that I'm impressed.  If you are in the Princes Street area this is well worth a visit - there's plenty of benches (and you'll see that I really mean that when you visit it) so you may as well stop here for a rest or for some lunch.  

I can't think of a better place to take a break.  Not only that, but across in your eyeline you'll see the castle and the spectacular mound it sits on.",5
Local Flavor,"Let's be honest, this is a pretty handy spot of greenery right in the centre of town, with exceptional scenery for your perusal, something which I'm probably completely ungrateful for, having lived in Edinburgh for so long.

The merits of lolling around in the gardens are simple. It's an expansive, well designed, green space available to everybody, so if you don't have a garden at home and fancy some chilled out sun basking, or if you're wandering about the centre and want to find a peaceful spot to drink your coffee or eat your lunch, or even just to banter with friends, the gardens are an accessible and scenic option. 

The gardens stretch across Princes Street in different, large sections, and form part of the dramatic looking landscape which separates old town and new. There are benches at intervals around the gardens, although a lot of people prefer a grassy seat or taking a pew underneath a tree. The views of the old town, including Edinburgh Castle of course, are beautiful from here, plus you have the towering Scott Monument to behold, the National Gallery, and the carousel and grand fountain towards the west side of the gardens. 

During hotter weather, people flock to the gardens in droves, which does create a really summery atmosphere, even if you can't find as quiet a spot as you would during the rest of the year. I love seeing the gardens most of all at Christmas time, when fairy lights are draped through the trees which border the gardens, and a Christmas fair and ice rink situate themselves inside the gardens for some festive mulled wine drinking and merry frolicking.",4
Local Flavor,"Open dawn til dusk 365 days a year, Princes Street Gardens is Edinburgh's equivalent of Central Park.

Situated in the middle of the city, it was built in 1820 and with the exception of a carousel, childrens playground and ice-rink in the winter, it's remained untouched. There's acres of green grass, pretty flower beds and thousands of shrubs which help create a calm and peaceful environment. 

Artists can  be seen painting canvases in the  summer and there's usually a clutter of tourists snapping shots of the surrounding landmarks. Speaking of which, Princes Street Gardens offers picture postcard views of everything from Edinburgh Castle and Scott Monument to the South Bridge, National Portrait Gallery and of course, Princes Street itself.",5
Local Flavor,"Princes Street Gardens is second only to the Meadows for a place to chill out with your mates on hot, sunny days.  The only problem is that is that it can get a bit tight for space, especially when everyone's trying to chuck a ball about.  

Regardless, it's got some well tended grass, nice benches and rows of trees and shrubs which give the place a really relaxed feel.  Whenever my friends and I are on Princes Street on scorching days we get a MaccyD's and a milkshake and head down to the gardens.  
Even when it's not T-shirt and shorts weather, it's still a great place to come and chill out right in the heart of the city.",5
Local Flavor,"Even though Princes Street gardens have been reviewed many times before, I thought I would contribute my own view of one of Edinburgh's delights! 

The gardens, which were artificially made (The area used to be a lake) is the ideal place to chill out in the city centre on a hot day! The gardens are all bright and well looked after. Whilst sitting and walking in the gardens you are offered great views of the city, including views looking up to the castle. 

Inside the gardens, the Sir Walter Scott Monument is located there, with it being a tourist hot spot. Deeper in the gardens there is an open air stage which has been home to many public music events. During the winter, these gardens are transformed into the Christmas village, with a Ferris wheel and an ice rink. 

Whatever time of year though, Princes Street gardens always stands out!",4
Local Flavor,"With the festival period under full swing in Edinburgh, walking down Princes Street is a task requiring real patience, and if you feel an aneurism coming on as I have many times over the last few days, it's good to know one can escape down to the gardens.

A friend and I discovered the gardens by mistake, and it's got to be The Pleasant Surprise of July 2010! Like many public areas in Edinburgh, it's immaculately maintained. It's also a whole level below Prince's Street so it's quite easy to forget all the chaos taking place just a few seconds away. It's large enough to properly strecth your legs, and they're all sorts of perfectly manicured flower bushes  here and there! To top it all off, there's a pretty impressive fountain in the midst of all this, and a mindblowing view of the Edinburgh Castle just above.

After spending such a long time mourning over the loss of the meadows, which is about 30 minutes away from my flat, I'm definitely a happy to have found a more than suitable replacement!",5
Local Flavor,"Princes Street was built in the 18th century and was an area that was made to help the Scottish accept the monarch and hence the names in the area all have references to monarchy- Princes Street, George (the reigning king at the time) Street, Hanover Street etc. The problem with this old architecture is that the buildings are all pretty small and were not designed for the huge department stores that normal British High Streets have been purpose built for.

However, there aren't many places in the world where you can shop until your hearts content in the shadow of a beautiful castle and at Christmas with the lights and the Ferris wheel, that lines up alongside the Scott Monument, there really isn't many places better to be!",4
Local Flavor,"Vous venez d'arriver à Edinburgh la Capitale de l'Ecosse, soit de l'aéroport en Autocar (1) ou en Taxi (il vous en coûtera 15 £, intéressant si vous êtes 4 ou 5), soit de Waverley Station en train.


 Si vous avez pris l'autocar ou le taxi, arrêtez-vous ou demandez Waverley Station (le nom est tiré du livre ""Waverley"" de Walter Scott).


 Si vous êtes train, vous n'avez pas trop le choix c'est le terminus. Sortez en direction de Waverley Bridge, tournez à droite en sortant et traversez bien au passage à piétons (Vous êtes sur Princes Street). Attention, les piétons ont la priorité uniquement là, si vous traversez ailleurs, vous risquez une belle frayeur. Faites vraiment attention.


 Après votre shopping sur Princes Street et si vos pieds ont besoin de se reposer, choisissez une des entrées du fabuleux Jardin éponyme de la rue.


 Princes Street Gardens est composé en réalité de 2 jardins :


 - Le West Princes Street Gardens
- Et le East Princes Street Gardens


 C'est deux jardins sont séparés par the Mound, artère éponyme du Musée. Cette rue traverse le jardin de Princes Street à Market Street et emmène les touristes de la nouvelle ville à l'ancienne.


 Commençons notre ballade en descendant les marches du West Gardens et admirons au loin Edinburgh Castle (http://www.qype.fr/place/55482-Edinburgh-Castle-Edinburgh) silencieux sur son rocher volcanique sauf à 13 heures quand le ""canon d'une heure"", c'est comme ça qui s'appelle, est tiré chaque jour.


 (Voir photo ci-dessous) 


 Tout au long de cette promenade vous pourrez éventuellemnt assister à un concert au ""Ross Open Air Theatre"". Soit pendant le grand Festival d'Edinburgh ou pour celui du jour l'an ou Hogmanay (http://www.qype.fr/place/78555-Winter-Wonderland-Edinburgh) en écosse. Pour le Hogmanay 2010, c'était Madness en concert.


 A midi, vous pourrez déguster des salades ou des sandwich de  Marks and Spencers  pour un pique-nique sur l'herbe. C'est ce qui ne manque dans ce jardin.


 Ensuite vous arriverez à la Piazza Ross Fountain (très belle fontaine où les formes généreuse des porteuses de cruches ne vous laissent pas indifférent). Et là vous pourrez dégustez La succulente glace 99 flakes. Le vendeur vous la servira dans un joli cornet et vous charmera avec accent scottish, en roulant les R.


 (Voir photo ci-dessous) 


 Si vous avez encore le temps vous pourrez visitez les deux églises dont une repose à l'intérieure du jardin près du cimetière (petit et très vieux cimetière, je ne connais pas du tout son époque) et une autre dont l'entrée est sur Lothian Road.


 Par une nuit sans lune, tapis dans la neige, vous pourrez apercevoir un écureuil entrain de manger sa réserve de nourriture. Celui-ci je l'ai rencontré dans le jardin pendant les fêtes du jour de l'an.

Local Flavor,great place for strolling in the middle of edinburgh to get away from the hustle bustle of all the traffic. great during winter with the winter wonderland but is expensive and in the summer you have crazy golf a must.,5
Local Flavor,"Beautiful plave and lovely to spend time in any season of the year.
1 star is taken off of it due to the drunken tramps.(raggedy men rather than slutty females lol)",4
Local Flavor,"Princes Street Gardens is not to be missed if you're visiting the city, and should be enjoyed by all the residents.  The gardens are beautiful and surprisingly peaceful despite the proximity to Princes Street.  It used to be one of my favourite places to visit in the city and I look forward to seeing it again.

My memory of the gardens is marred only by an experience we had with a Council worker there.  My wife and I were feeding the birds in the garden and as they were pecking at the breadcrumbs we'd thrown for them this man in a yellow waistcoat came charging up to us screaming about how we were littering and threatening us to try and get us to clean up the crumbs the birds would have eaten had it not been for his loud intrusion.

Unfortunately, this is not an uncommon experience in the gardens.  Those in charge of maintaining the place can be a little militant and can tarnish an otherwise beautiful day.  Not the fault of the gardens, but one star removed because of their obtrusive and sometimes offensive behaviour.",4
Local Flavor,Other than the Meadows there's nowhere better for an easy stroll on a sunny day.,4
Local Flavor,"Not much to add to what others have written except to say that in mid-April the tulips, daffodils, azaleas, and rhododendrons were at the peak of their blooming. Loads of statues with plaques, playgrounds, a carousel, snack bars, benches, and even a small amphitheater.  

I hope you Edinburgers (is that the right word?) appreciate how fortunate you are to have this garden in the heart of the city.",5
Local Flavor,"When the day is nice and warm, nothing beats this place with an ice cream.",5
Local Flavor,"Princes Street Gardens is a stunning oasis in the middle of the city. 

It has absolutely everything you look for in a city centre park... lawn, trees, shrubs, flowers, I'm pretty sure there's a rhododendron but then again I am botanically challenged. Also, squirrels, lots  and lots and lots of squirrels, more squirrels than you could safely fit on a skewer, then again, barbecuing isn't allowed anyway. 

The gardens are free to visit and split in two by a ruddy big gallery in the middle, so, if it's raining you can get some culture",5
Local Flavor,"I noticed yesterday that the listing for Princes St disappeared somehow, so I'm making a new one.

Princes St is Edinburgh's main middle-of-the-road shopping street.  It's not terribly upmarket but it's certainly not downmarket, it just... is what it is.

For affordability, it has just about any type of shop you could want to visit all in one convenient row.

I say ""convenient"" but actually the placement of these businesses means that Princes St can be a nightmare to navigate if you're just trying to get from Point A to Point B, because it has the tendency to be rammed full of people meandering around the shops.  For this reason I do my best to avoid it on weekends, especially when it's dry.

Everyone's favourite tram works have actually made Princes St a bit more pedestrian friendly in places (and much less friendly in others, when you can't see a crossing for miles) because it has parts of the street closed off to traffic but open to pedestrians.  I've heard a rumour that there have been talks to remove non-tram traffic from the street entirely and make it mostly pedestrian, with covered cafe areas and more upmarket shops.  That would certainly be interesting as Princes St could be so much more than it is now.  The view of the castle and gorgeous Princes St Gardens to one side make this a pretty prime area for tourists to visit, but they're then met with the likes of the Gap and Primark.   

So for now it's a solid 3 star visit, but we'll see in the future.",3
Local Flavor,"Lovely gardens with an even lovelier view of the city.  What could be better - nature meets architecture.  Definitely a place to go if you are in the area.  Evening, morning - ANYTIME!",5
Local Flavor,Beautiful garden's with crazy amazing views of Edinburgh.  There is a gorgeous fountain towards the end where you can get a great shot of Edinburgh castle in the background.  When I was there it was all decked out for the Olympics.  A nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle on the streets of Edinburgh.,4
Local Flavor,"went to specifically find Ross Fountain. Would to have liked to have seen it with water (I mean, what's the point of a fountain with no water). But, we did get some great photos from there of Edinburgh Castle.",3
Local Flavor,Breathtaking.  These gardens are FREE and absolutely beautiful.  It divides both old and new town and is a great way to get in between the two.,5
Local Flavor,"Shop, eat, caffeinate 
The castle always in view.
People everywhere!",3
Local Flavor,"How can you rate this less than five stars I don't know. These inner city gardens are a blessing for Edinburgh. Summertime is just not the same without a stroll. Clean, spacious and massive views to be had from every angle! Picnicking is a must. The music area bit is great as they have loads of concerts and events going on. Wintertime you get the iceskating rink. Lots of landscaping to be enjoyed too. You visit Edinburgh you need to go here.",5
Local Flavor,"It used to be so nice - and it used to have so many shops and it used... oh let's write what it is now. (well for the last 3 years..) The main word here is ""TRAM"" or rather the tram works. Which have dominated the street for far to long now. Even-though the full iron cordons have disappeared there is still the aftermath (even before any tram has shown) - Most of the shops have been transformed / closed or replaced. There are many empty units and the majority of the business is phone shops, banks and tatty sellers. 

I would so much like to write about the lovely strolls you can take here, but that would be a massive lie. The buses (almost all of them pass through Princes Street!)  , taxis and general traffic have reclaimed the space once the closures were lifted. 

Yes, surely it looks over the many famous touristy and photogenically bits of Edinburgh: The Balmoral, Waverley Station, Princes Street Gardens, Mound, The Castle, The National Gallery, Scots Monument, Jenner's and Calton Hill in a distance.. oh.. and of course the Primark Flagship store. - and that's about it. 

More baffling is that this is the only big street that tourist tend to visit after the Royal Mile / High Street in Old Town. - whilst the hinterland containing Rose Street, George Street and Queen Street in New Town lies mostly unexplored. 

Hopefully the trams will clean up the traffic and not just add to it and make it even more noisy and unattractive. 

Also bear in mind that the Christmas Market and annual Hogmanay Street Party is held on this street. About one hundred  thousand ( #100000 ) people descent here and squeeze together to celebrate the passing of another year.  This is mostly what makes Princes Street a  world famous street. 

2 stars for the current famous visitor and cultural attractions and 1star for its potential - if the available shops and traffic flows were any better it would be a 5 star affair. sadly I don't see this happening for a long while.",3
Local Flavor,"This long, one-sided street is a bit like Marmite. You either love or hate it.

It is rubbish for shopping as it only has shops on one side of it, but on the other hand it has a spectacular castle on the other side.

Overall, on that one sunny day of the year that we have in Edinburgh, it is nice to take a leisurely walk along Princes Street, do a bit of shopping and bask in the glory that is Edinburgh castle. Maybe even grab an ice cream and lie in Princes Street Gardens.

Today though, on this wet and miserable March day, I do not like Princes Street. I find it a chore to visit, especially if I want to go to Zara and Topshop as they are at opposite ends.",3
Local Flavor,"Splendid Castle views... 
Institution of new town...
Love the tram project...",2
Local Flavor,"I both love and loath this street. I think this is directly proportionate to the number of people on it.

On a busy shopping day, or in peak tourist season, it's hell! 

On a quiet night with the castle lit up it's amazing. A reminder of why I love Edinburgh.",5
Local Flavor,"Why do I love Princes Street so much? I hate shopping, especially at chain stores. I hate crowds, and hordes of tourists. But despite all this, I am happy each time I get to walk down Princes Street. Its view of the castle and Old Town was my first impression of Edinburgh, and it's stunning to take in no matter how many times I've seen it.",5
Local Flavor,"These Gardens are what save Princes Street itself from being a commercial, mess of a street since the Trams came along; and give it a beautiful, green, peaceful yet busy aspect that make it feel like it isn't the central, main street of a capital City.

The Gardens run the full length of Princes Street, from Waverley Station and the Scots' Monument, to the church at the corner of Lothian Road and the West End. They are on a hill too, so manage to fit in more lounging grass space, without taking up more metres. So they're quite narrow, but long, but also fit a lot in.

There's an auditorium space, which I think would be wonderful to stage some old Shakespeare plays on, and which is used a lot in the Festival. There are wonderful monumnents (the big fountain at the West End area) that make beautiful photo opportunities. There are quiet stretches of grass for making daisy chains. There are beautiful flower beds. There is even a wee house half-way down that I am convicned is Bilbo Baggin's cousin's hobbit house.

They have a wonderful charm, they are beautifully maintained, and they pretty much balance out any negative aspects that the never-ending, messy tram works have brought to Princes Street. Walking down Princes Street can be stressful despite the wide pavements, with lots of tourists. So I often walk back along Princes Street Gardens with an iced coffee or snack in hand, and in the Spring it's especially beautiful to sit and take the ambiance of Edinburgh in: admiring the Castle, hearing the trains go by, and sitting perfectly betwixt and between the Old Town and New Town.",4
Local Flavor,"Is there any way you can not love Princes Street Gardens? One of the best places for people watching in the world, these beautiful floral gardens are one of Edinburgh's most famous features. Dotted with probably close to 200 benches, it's a great meeting place for it's location and when it's sunny, can be a great place to lie on the grass and enjoy some rays.

The Gardens are also home to a fantastic fair at Christmastime, that has half the gardens jam packed with stalls selling cotton candy to authentic polish fast food, a plethora of rides from the ferris wheel to the swings that I'm always absolutely terrified are going to throw me off, and more tourists flocking to it than probably anywhere else in the city. It's so beautiful and Colin and I love coming through every year to go.",4
Local Flavor,"Princes Street... probably the most famous street in Edinburgh after the Royal Mile and Arden Street (the street John Rebus lives on in Ian Rankin's novels).  but as much as i love edinburgh and all it's different offerings i'm not a massive fan of princes street.

the pros of this street are the shops obviously.  i love a roam around jenners as the building is so fantastic.  and all the high street brands are there: new look, h&m, top shop, river island, next, and of course primark!!  there is also a good sized marks & spencers with a great food hall and a massive HMV which is apparently not closing anymore.  so very good for shopping!

but then the cons... on a weekend this street and these shops are packed!!  i really detest crowds and tend to get very irritated by them so this is not my ideal place to go on a weekend.  also the pavements get rather congested with people waiting at bus stops for their next bus and tourists stopping randoming to take pictures and people just generally getting in my way.  yeah, really hate crowds... also getting from one side to the other on a bus during rush hour takes agesssssssssss and i feel like i could probably walk it faster.

so princes street has some positives but i'm not a big fan and tend to avoid it unless i need something from primark as this is the only location in town.  however, i can undertand why it's such a hotspot with the lovely views of the castle and old town and also the beautiful princes street gardens!",3
Local Flavor,"Has amazing views...
Is great in any season...
Staple of Edina.",4
Local Flavor,"En petit coin de verdure en plein milieu du centre-ville ! 

Princes Street Gardens est l'endroit parfait pour faire une petite pause après une session shopping. Situé juste en-dessous de Princes Street, ce petit parc est bondé de monde dès qu'un rayon de soleil apparait, mais c'est tellement rare qu'on fait abstraction et qu'on vient s'y poser comme tout le monde.

En vous baladant un peu, vous aurez de jolies vues sur le Château d'Edimbourg, le Scott Monument, le Balmoral Hotel, North Bridge et les musées alentours.

En hiver, c'est ici que la patinoire s'installe et même si vous n'êtes pas habile sur des patins, vous pourrez toujours déguster un verre de vin chaud puisque le marché de noël (allemand) se trouve juste à côté.",4
Local Flavor,"Guess I have not done a review for Princes st, thought I had oh well here goes. Jennie S. used a perfect analogy for it and just what I was trying to think of. She said its a bit like Marmite , you either love or hate it. That was perfect Jennie couldnt have said it better! I have a love/hate though with it. I hate the crowds always on it ( and I mean hate I know its a strong word but I really dont like the massive crowds). Ok I am going to complain here a bit so bear with me. I hate it when you have 3-5 people standing right in the middle of the sidewalk and when you try to pass you get stuck behind someone moving slower then molasses in winter. Meanwhile the rest of the street is packed like a school of fish and its dangerous just to get from one side of the street to the other without fear of being ran down. I swear people on this street will run right into you or run you over and not bat an eye or blame you for them running into you. The shopping is also Meh. I dont shop there that much. But that said its got a wonderful view of the castle on the other side and the art museum and the lovely park. So I love one half of the side of the street and hate the other half if that makes any sense.",3
Local Flavor,"People, you - you do realise how awesome this street is, right? Right? I've heard people complain about the fact that there are shops only on one side. But - you guys! That's the whole point! That's the joy of it!

Instead of a generic shopping street that could be any old place in the world, you have all your usual chains and everything for which the regular high-street fashionista could wish, with the added joy of dazzling views over the gardens and across to the Old Town.

You get the gothic majesty of the Walter Scott Monument framed against the spires and turrets of Assembly Hall and St Giles' Cathedral.

You get wide pavements to help you in navigating the throngs, and plenty of crossings in the street to take you over to the gallery or the gardens.

You get something different from the streets that house these shops in other cities all over the UK.

So why on earth would anyone want shops on the other side as well? I can't think of a single chain shop that's missing from Princes Street. Sure, it would be lovely to see some independent shops stake a claim in one of the black empty shopfronts in this currently somewhat snaggle-toothed row, but equally, one goes to Princes Street knowing what one wants, not in the spirit of exploration and creativity which inspires an indy spree - it serves an entirely different purpose, and serves it solidly and with pretty pictures opposite.

The only downside to this arrangement is the tourist type that walks along just in front of you and then stops dead in his/her tracks, camera aloft, as though only having just noticed the castle. Still, that's one way to meet to people...",4
Local Flavor,"The Princes Street Gardens were really pretty on a nice, sunny day. It looks like a great place to take children, dogs, or a picnic basket. The Scott Monument is right there too, which has impressive architecture. You can get a great view of Edinburgh Castle from the gardens as well. There's even a castle-themed playground, but I think I was too big for the slides. I caught the distinct scent of pot smoke several times while walking through, but I'm not judging.",5
Local Flavor,"Princes Street Gardens is so worthy of a five star rating. There always seems to be a free bench, the view of the castle is magnificent and the instant wave of calm as you enter it's foliage-y bliss after a stroll along busy Princes Street is unbeatable.",5
Local Flavor,"When I was growing up in Glasgow I knew about Princes St. The main street in Edinburgh that gave you everything. If you wanted it, there would be someone on this street or one of the streets just off it that would sell it.

10 years later and I'm living in Edinburgh, and as much as I adore this city which is almost as much if not just a tad more than I adore my Glasgow roots, it seems that Edinburgh REALLY like phone shops.

All joking aside now, this is such a beautiful street with fantastic views of the Casltle, the Princes St Gardens are beautiful and there is a bus to just about anywhere on the planet from this street so why is this street being ruined by all these phone shops? In some cases there are more than 1 branch in the same street. 2 Carphone Warehouse's, 2 3Mobile shops, 2 EE shops. Not cool.

I understand this has more to do with phone companies being huge capitalists and buying up just about any square foot of space that they can to make a sale, it is a shame that it has gone that way though.

I love this street for the views and the fact there are galleries and great places to eat and drink on a nice day. I just wish something could be done about those phone shops.",3
Local Flavor,"On a nice day, it's the ideal place to just sit and people watch.

On a rainier day, it's still a nice place to people watch.

The Princes Street Gardens are lovely to stroll through and I think the key word here is stroll THROUGH. People are always cutting through it to go somewhere else. But it sure makes for lovely scenery!",5
Local Flavor,"Call me crazy, but I'd like to visit Edinburgh in the fog and drizzle someday. I don't know how I got so lucky to have tropical weather on my first visit to Scotland, but this was where I received my only sunburn of the season thus far (it actually happened at the Castle, which is pretty exposed at the top). But I didn't care about the heat, and neither did any of the pale-skinned and -haired ancestral cousins that surrounded me at Princes Street Gardens. The place is so gorgeous, and as it happened, there were so many shady spots on benches and the lawn, one could be protected. 

This was our picnic spot a couple times, and a place of rest during so many miles of walking.

This is a great centerpiece for a day's visit to Edinburgh. There are gardens of many varieties, statuary and memorials, and excellent nature. The trees are decorative. The grass is so small and fine compared to the giant blades in the US. The views are stunning. Right nearby you have the Walter Scott Momument, and the nearby road to the Edinburgh Castle, plus chapels, museums,  and other formidable buildings. Princes Street is obviously nearby, so shopping and eateries are a-plenty. There's an M&S grocery very nearby, ideal for a picnic. There's even a ferris wheel.

The people watching was good. A couple guys practicing their tightrope juggling were shooed off by the park workers, in consideration of the trees. There were young families, newborn babies lying on the lawns, elderly couples arm-in-arm, purple - haired teens, military, and many foreign languages heard. It reminded me of a smaller Lincoln Park or Central Park.",5
Local Flavor,"Princes Street is a great place to shop when in Edinburgh, especially on a sunny day. With great views across to the Old Town, stunning views of Edinburgh Castle as well as the Princes Street Gardens and various monuments, it's well worth a visit when wandering around Edinburgh.

The shops themselves tend to be the typical chain stores you would find anywhere in the UK - H&M, River Island, Monsoon, Debenhams as well as Jenners. It really is one of those streets that has a little bit of something. I love that it's the main street of Edinburgh and yet you're not closed in in the centre of the city. With shops on one side and open green spaces and the river on the other, it really makes you feel like you're in a small town rather than a large Scottish City. There's also the National Gallery which is free and well worth a visit, so be sure to check it out!",4
Local Flavor,"A wonderful green space in the centre of this big Scottish city. We had a wonderful sunny afternoon and took a stroll through these gardens. The floral clock is really nice and has a display every half hour (I think!), it makes for a really nice walk through the city and the green of the grass is perfect. I hear it used to be the dumping ground for sewerage in the 14th - 18th century! (No wonder the grass is so green!) It's a beautiful spot to check out in Edinburgh, a bit of a hidden gem!",5
Local Flavor,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Princes Street Gardens yet. It seems a bit silly, considering that this is the first place I went after arriving wide eyed (and travel worn) from Canada for my new Scottish adventure.

I don't think it's possible to MISS these gardens on a trip to Edinburgh, given that they are smack in the middle of the city, but that's just all the more reason to hand them the oh so hefty five stars. They are gardens, SMACK in the MIDDLE of the city. And not wimpy little block long gardens... sprawling, beautiful, manicured and lofty gardens just hanging out in the middle of town.

It was love at first plunk on the grass beneath the castle, staring at the Scot Monument...

Seriously Edinburgh, you give good view.

I've had a few locals tell me i'll get used to it, that it's too ""touristy"" and that the charm wears off. But that's just silly. And here's why:

There's a CASTLE in the MIDDLE of the city, that overlooks amazing gardens in the MIDDLE of the city, that lie between two parts of town that quite frankly, look like scenes out of a movie.

If that doesn't make you catch your breath every time you're walking through this place - you need a hug.

Or maybe, next time you wander through Princes Street Gardens, pause for a second and try to see this city through this wide eyed little Canadian's eyes - trust me, you'll fall in love all over again. I do.",5
Local Flavor,"Die Einkaufsstraße im neuen Teil von Edinburgh. Viele Straßenkünstler sorgen hier für Unterhaltung. Zur einen Seite Gärten und Denkmäler sind auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite Kaufhäuser, Shops, Restaurants, und u.a. ein Apple-Store aufgereit, wie Perlen an einer Schnur. Sehr sehenswert ist das Kaufhaus Jenners von innen und außen. Aber auch schottische Trachten- und  Tartanläden lohnen mehr als nur einen Besuch.
Von der Princes-Street führen mehrere Brücken in die Altstadt von Edinburgh, welche als Brücken kaum zu erkennen sind, da sie rundherum bebaut sind.  Eine Ausnahme ist hier Waverlery Bridge, Dreh und Angelpunkt der Hof-on-Hop-Off-Bussund des Flughafenbusses Airlink.

Mit etwas Glück trifft man hier auch auf sehr poussierliche, zutrauliche und gut ernährte Hörnchen. Informierte Touristen mit Popcorn oder Nüssen sind hier sehr beliebt und werden sogleich ins Herz geschlossen bzw. geliked. Hier beweist sich einmal mehr, dass Liebe doch durch den Magen geht.
Der Rasen ist hier im Rautemustern gemäht. Ein schöner Ort zwischen dem alten Edinburgh mit Burg und Altstadt und dem neuen Teil dieser wunderbaren Stadt.",4
Local Flavor,"I can't think of anything negative to say about this wonderful public park. 

The Princes Street Gardens is a beautiful park in Edinburgh that straddles New and Old Town, with Waverley Station just below. The park itself has many benches, open grassy areas to sit in, and it is covered with trees and nice pathways all throughout the park. 

Visiting on a sunny day is a day you'll really appreciate Edinburgh. Grab some provisions, ciders, and some friends, and enjoy the afternoon at this park. For me, even just stopping by and taking some pictures of the park and the surrounding area is a real treat. 

Definitely this is a place I will come back to and bring friends back to as well. The essence of Edinburgh is in this park and the nice weather really brings out the best vibe at this park. It is a lot of fun to hang at the park and just enjoy the afternoon. 

I can't wait to come back!",5

At the very least you will enjoy the atmosphere of shopping on Princess Street, rather than going to a characterless mall or shopping centre.

Local Flavor,"The street in Edinburgh for shopping. I don't even like shopping very much, but I love hanging out on Princes Street, often just to watch people going about their daily lives. The street is nicer since traffic has been diverted off it (with the exception of buses and taxis). There are wide pavements to walk along, plenty of benches to have a seat and relax, and the beautiful Princes Street Gardens to sit in as well, the latter being particularly nice on a sunny day.

The street is mainly made up of shops, especially chains like Superdrug, Primark, Debenhams, H&M etc. For more classy shopping, George Street is not far away. When I visit Princes Street, I tend to get coffee at Debenhams. Say what you will about that, but the view of the castle from the Debenhams Cafe is incredible.

Princes Street also has attractions, such as the Scott Monument, the National Gallery, and some beautiful architecture as well. Plenty of photo opportunities. So important is this street, that it is the street one imagines when one thinks of ""the centre of Edinburgh"". Check it out.",5
Local Flavor,"Princes Street Gardens is a lovely space right in the middle of the city. I don't have a bad thing to say about this. It's like taking a time out from the business of Princess street to enjoy the views in this peaceful area. 

In the summer the gardens are full of friends, families and individuals enjoying picnics in the sun, right now this place is awesome because of the Christmas markets! Great at any time of the year. 

Definitely worth checking out.",5
Local Flavor,"I have loads of fave places in Edinburgh but princes street garden is one of them. It's lush green lawn and beautiful backdrop of the various medieval buildings including Edinburgh castle makes this place the perfect place to lounge and watch the world pass by especially in the summer. One of my fave places to do in the summer is hanging out here with friends in the afternoon while eating ice cream. 

This place is perfect because: 

1. It's located right smack in city centre, but when you're in it... It doesn't feel like your in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the city centre. 

2. It's free to enter and lounge anywhere.

3. So green and filled with lush plants (more so in the summer) 

4. Easy place to find...just right smack in city centre. 

5. Great place to ""people watch.""

6. There's places you can buy food like ice cream and enjoy it while chillin. 

7. There's benches so if you don't want to sit on grass you don't have to. 

8. The lawn is perfect to sit and lay around on... During the sunny days of summer, the tress provide shade. 

9. Once you're recharged, you can cross the street and go shopping. 

10. If you don't live in Edinburgh, you can easily take the buss or train since Waverley station is nearby and the majority of the bus stops are on princ",5

There are various hotels like the Royal British, the Balmoral, easyHotel, Premier Inn and Mercure. There is also Princes Street Gardens, which is a fine example of great landscaping. They are absolutely beautiful to look at with the historic backdrop of the Old Toun opposite the railway. The St. James centre is near Princes Street, which has John Lewis, Next, River Island, Ryman, and smaller branches of Boots and Superdrug, but the entire centre apart from John Lewis is being pulled down. They are making a new shopping centre with a giant hotel as the centrepiece. Near the St James is Multrees Walk which boasts Edinburgh's posh shops. On this street, you will find Harvey Nichols, Burberry, Mulberry, Tommy Hilfilger, G Star Raw, Valvona & Crolla and Nescafé. Overall, Princes Street boasts a good line up and I somehow find the freezing cold air when I walk up from the train station really refreshing.",5

A must see for tourists and this is pretty much the central shopping strip for Edinburgh city. I can't think of any shops it's lacking and is pretty much your launching point into old town, new town, the Royal Mile and the gardens across the street. 

Also within view of stunning monuments like the Scott monument, Nelson monument and its only a short walk to Calton Hill. 

Ok as I wrote this I'm falling more in love with Princes Street but the fact remains, this place is impossibly busy every hour of the day. 

That said, if you can think of anything you need or want you'll like find it on Princes Street or within walking distance of it.",4
Local Flavor,"Let me point this out right off the bat: this five star is simply for the view... 

I like Princes Street when I don't have to walk down it. With a coffee in hand and plunked on a park bench, you'd be hard pressed to find a better view of the skyline (without you know, walking uphill...). At these times, I adore Princes Street... but eventually I have to move and when that happens, if it's not exceptionally early in the morning or exceptionally late at night, love goes to frustration pretty darn quickly. 

Like any tourist hub, Princes Street is routinely packed to the rafters - with the train station and the aforementioned view, paired with the parade of big box stores, it's tourist heaven and local hell. I actively avoid this street in the summer because I walk exceptionally fast and nothing bugs me more than getting stuck behind a slow family of tourists who have fanned out on the sidewalk. Or worse yet, those groups who unceremoniously stop to take a picture of the castle, causing the pedestrian equivalent of a ten car pile up outside Boots... it's busy.

But on a clear weekday night in autumn, walking back from a pint in Old Town there is no place prettier... and for those quiet moments of ""whoa, I live here!"", I hand over a five star.",5
Local Flavor,"Yay! I'm a fan. That's what four stars means, and it sums up Princes Street Gardens pretty well.

It's a park in the middle of the city, like, slap bang in the middle. High-street shops on one side, and a big ol' castle on the other. There's a beautiful flower clock created every year, and a charming house belonging to the chief park ranger, plus a really lovely war memorial that I always forget is there. In the middle you've got the Ross Bandstand, which occasionally hosts gigs (I saw Belle and Sebastian here years ago), I challenge you to find a prettier venue. And at the west-most end is a children's play park.

For me, it's the place I come and sit for twenty minutes on sunny days when I want to top up my vitamin D and get a break for the office. I'm pretty sure it's almost entirely full of office-workers doing the same thing between 12 and 2pm on weekdays. As long as I continue to work in the city centre, Princes Street Gardens will remain my sunny spot of choice.",4

I had tried to do it online but was told I didn't qualify for that method.  I tried to do it by phone and that didn't work either, so I justwent to this office which was only about a mile from where I was staying I only had about a 15 minute wait when I got there, even with no appointment.  An hour and a half after I walked in the door I walked out fully qualified for Social Security and Medicare. What more could you ask for? Very efficient.",4
Public Services & Government,"The Security Officer at the entrance of the Mesa office was extremely helpful. He was very nice and friendly.

Public Services & Government,"My only experience(s) going to a Social Security office is at this one, which (from what I understand) is probably good thing considering most have a DMV-like reputation. 

It helps (probably A LOT) that this office doesn't deal directly w/assigning SS numbers & issuing cards. They pretty much deal w/monetary stuff pertaining to SS (retirement,death benefits, disability, etc...). The office is small, but clean. It's a kind of a weird set-up. You get checked/questioned by a security guard when you enter, then you go to a machine, enter your SS number, answer a few questions, and they give you a number. 

The seating area is rows of aluminum benches. I've had two experiences here (I had to come back 2-3x for each) & I can't think of a single time I had to wait that long for my number to be called. Where long waits can occur is if you actually have to ""interview"" w/someone to review information. However, once you're called back the people who conduct said interviews are nice & knowledgable (at least that was my experience).",4
Public Services & Government,Horrible security process run by disrespectful guards. Amazing that this place has limited hours as there was a line out the door prior to the office opening. Such a bad experience.,1
Public Services & Government,"This review is not for the lady that helped me she was great it's for the security guard who helped some others locate their problem but not me. When I got there he asked me what I was therefore I told him and he told me to get a number. What he didn't tell me that they can't offer me service. On top of that he was kind a rude to people's children I understand there are safety concerns but that doesn't mean you need to be rude, they're kids.",2
Public Services & Government,"Hello fellow Yelpers,

First time having to go to Social Security for anything... Needless to say we were not looking forward to this!

We were pleasantly surprised!

Got there at 9a short line... Moved pretty quick.

Your first interaction is with the security man who we found serious yet that friendly gleam in his eye indicating he was really a friendly guy just doing his job!

You put your social security number in a computer and out pops your number!

Easy schemzy!

Waited maybe 15 minutes and was attended to by a very friendly and helpful young man!

Needed more answers than he can provide so we had to wait for another... Back to the numbers board.

Only took 10 minutes until we were called and helped by CRISTINA.

Super helpful super friendly! She truly acted like she cared and was able to answer our questions!

Thank you to the staff for your excellent work!

Hopefully we won't have to ever go back... But if we did we won't dread it!

So in conclusion remember to always take time to stop and smell the roses....

You only live once!",4
Public Services & Government,"The security guards are nice but I think they've forgotten that they aren't cops. Numbers were being called smoothly up until getting 2 numbers away from my moms number which began with B. Now everything has been stalled while they stick to calling only numbers that begin with F. We've waited for over an hour and continue to wait. By, that's usually what you have to expect when handling business at any government office.",2
Public Services & Government,I received terrible service every time I went there They're just not very nice. They were rude and unpleasant. I live in Mesa but will be going all the way to the Tatum office because of the way I was treated,2
Public Services & Government,"I was VERY surprised.  I was in and out in 20 mins. 

1.  I took as little into the building as possible; wallet and paper work
2.  I brought everything I thought I needed so we would not waste time
3. The person that helped me was fast, and to the point

I got what I needed and left!",4
Public Services & Government,I come here and no problems I would recommend coming here in the morning before anyone else gets here,5
Public Services & Government,"If I could give less than one star, I gladly would.  Any time I've had to visit this office, we've been made to wait in excess of three hours.  five seems more typical.  They could look to the DMV for a better model of efficiency.  I cannot imagine how they don't have more people staffing the windows: They're paying so many out of work people anyways, you'd think they could just hire three or four.  Since they lost the information we watched them make photocopies of, personally...  Twice...  I've had a case closed on me, and in the course of reapplying was told to come back in since I can't seem to sign up for the NEW website online.  I work nights, do I have 5 hours to spend during daytime hours sitting in a chair getting sick?  The last person I spoke to on the phone said their system had been down for five days, but half an hour earlier I was able to get the password for my new account ...  I had to call back because they didn't give me a USERNAME with it.  The lady I spoke to who was telling me that it was down then transferred me to an automated message telling me that the system was down, which then hung up on me.
I'm a genius, and I've had over a month, maybe as much as two, invested in trying to get us insurance through the state.  I CANNOT imagine how people too stupid to qualify for jobs manage to navigate this system.  Is there a cottage industry of lawyers or squatters who sit in the office to wait in your place, professionally?  Should I call up and tell them that I like lamp, and wait for them to get me some mental retardation assistant who can walk me through this?
Just another example of horrific government bureaucratic nightmare.  What the HELL?",1
Public Services & Government,"This location is the department that manages unemployment, food stamps and healthcare.  I went from 42nd in line to 30 something in the span of 3 hours.  I had to leave due to other appointments with no resolution to my reason for being there.

Last time I was here was for my food stamps application and I was there for over 6 hours between waiting and the interview.  The staff was busting their humps trying to get things done, I know.  Unfortunately they seem to be understaffed for their demand these days.  It's a bad economy, the job market sucks and I'm more miffed at the state HR department for not staffing the office with the apparently necessary staff than the actual staff.  

Regardless of who's fault it was, I cannot give this location a good review due to the lack of efficiency.",2
Public Services & Government,"I don't understand how they won't help a pregnant woman. I've been here four times and had nothing resolved, I don't have health care because we can't afford it:( and DES won't help me, I'm three months pregnant and I've only seen the doctor once! Only because I had to go to the emergency room to check if I wasn't miscarrying my baby due to bleeding and now I have a $3,000+ bill that I can't even afford to pay:(  

Thanks DES for not helping me, and helping tweekers and druggies instead of a pregnant woman.

By the way, the guy at the front desk today in the baby blue shirt should be fired. He's such a rude and unpleasant person. The lady next to him I like, she's always try's to help me as much as she can.",1
Public Services & Government,This office staffs personal life and leaving to go about thier weekend was more important than giving me 5 minutes of time. I had to take time off work and drive an hour from where I live. I saw the supervisor and all she had to do was put my check info into the system. Instead I was told to come back after explaining all of this. I have 3 kids am a single mom and work. It would have taken less time for her to input it then it did for the supervisor to tell me 20 minutes to close after waiting hours that I needed to plan it better and I could come back another day. And why have a phone number or extensions if we can't get thru and all the mailboxes are full.......,1
Public Services & Government,Had to take my cousin here which is a whole story of its own.  Government agencies like this drive me nuts with the inefficient ways that they are run with no motivation at all to make things otherwise.  A half a day I will never get back.  2 stars instead of 1 because the person that helped us was pretty much helpless but not a total jerk.,2
Restaurants,"Eine tolle Geschäftsidee, toll umgesetzt. In der ehemaligen Metzgerei Schmidt werden seit ca. 4 Wochen jetzt nur noch Teigwaren verkauft. Fleisch habe ich in den Ravioli auch noch nicht entdeckt, aber dafür eine Lachsvariation.
Die Vital-Ravioli mit Ingwer sind überraschenderweise ein leckerer Knaller. Preislich nicht ganz günstig (Manufaktur!), aber dafür geschmacklich ein Erlebnis.
Mo, Mi, Do und Fr gibt es einen Mittagstisch mit einem Tagesgericht z.B. ""Tagespasta mit Cocktailtomätchen und Mozarellakügelchen"" oder auch ""Garnele & Zitrone Ravioli an Limettenbutter"" uvm.


 Wenn ich ehrlich bin, habe ich irgendwas ""italienisches"" erwartet, was mich beim betreten des Ladens begrüßt. Is aber nich so, weil nämlich der Ingo über die Ladentheke hervorlächelt, super sympatischer mittdreißiger Karlsruher macht die Pasta selbst und verkauft sie auch.",4
Restaurants,"ja, der papa corleone. gestern sind wir dort gewesen und auch zum großteil recht zufrieden. was ich mag: lieber eine kleine karte mit ausgezeichneten gerichten als eine große und mittelmäßige karte.
zur auswahl drei verschiedene vorspeisen, einmal suppe, einmal bruschetta und einmal melone-rucola-salat. normalerweise probiere ich bei italienischer küche immer bruschetta, da die einfachen gerichte immer ein guter gradmesser sind. kostet hier allerdings 6,90 für das Duo, ich nehme mal an, es sind zwei scheiben. das war mir dann doch zu..najapreisintensiv. der salat war so wie er sein soll und der preis auch in ordnung. als hauptgerichte hatten wir jeweils einmal pasta, einmal tagliatelle und einmal ravioli.
kostenpunkt 13-14 euro. hmm. klingt erstmal hoch für nen teller nudeln, allerdings ist die qualität absolut den preis wert. man sollte auch bedenken, dass man durch die güte des nudelteigs und die zubereitung sehr gut satt wird. dazu einen offenen wein, eine weinschorle, ein wasser und einen café corretto für knapp 63 euro.
preise sind ja allgemein am gutenbergplatz immer ein thema  ich bin bereit für top-qualität mehr zu zahlen, aber auch nur dann. wenn ich das bestätigte gefühl habe, dass nur wegen der lage oder der angeblichen hipness der preis steigt, ist das nicht meine tasse tee und ich ziehe mich zurück. bei papa corleone scheint der mittagstisch richtig günstig zu sein  abends ist es  je nach wahl der gerichte  zwar nicht unangemessen teuer, aber dennoch nennenswert.
der service ist flink, freundlich und unaufdringlich.
wir werden wieder hingehen.",4

Der Kaffee ist in Ordnung, nichts besonderes  also falls man jetzt echt italienischen Espresso sucht  hier nicht. Ein Café Americano war der Bedienung auch unbekannt  aber sie bringt auch recht selten eine Karte. Die Klassiker kennt man.
Was mich aber wirklich stört ist das es dauert  erst wartet man lange darauf bestellen zu dürfen, dann dauert es extrem lange bis der Kaffee kommt und bezahlen  lieber schonmal ankündigen gleich nachdem der Kaffee gebracht wurde.
Ich würde hier auch nicht hingehen, wenn man nicht so nett draußen sitzen könnte vor oder nachdem man den Markt besucht hat",3

Restaurants,"Ich war oft und gerne im Hubraum. Es ist geradezu ideal mit Kindern und sogar für ein Geschäftsessen. Ich habe mich ehrlich gefreut, dass es sich wohltuend vom prolligen P10 absetzte.
Leider musste ich nun merken, dass die tolle Speisekarte auf eine Snackkarte (Currywurst, Flammkuchen) ohne Anspruch reduziert wurde. Auch die Qualität nahm deutlich ab und das Publikum verändert sich merklich.
Sehr schade! Schnell korrigierte ich meine Empfehlungen an Freunde und Bekannte. Was für ein Potential  bitte macht was daraus!",2
Restaurants,"Alles in allem eigentlich eine tolle Location, perfekt mit dem Radl zu erreichen, genug Parkplätze vor der Tür und mit dem Sandboden ist man ratzfatz in eine Urlaubs- oder zumindest Entspannungsstimmung versetzt. Wie durlacher auch, freuten wir uns über das schöne P10-Ambiente ohne wasdortauchimmersorumläuft. Aber wir sind eigentlich davon ausgegangen, dass der Laden erst kürzlich eröffnet hat. Essen? Wo, was und wann? Trinken? Aah, auf der anderen Seite und immer alles gleich am Stand bezahlen. Bis man hin und her gelaufen ist mit Teller, Gläser, Essen und Geldbeutel  ist schon mal die Entspannungsstimmung dahin. Am Sonntag gab es nur Essen vom Grill und verschiedene Salate. Selbst gemacht und lecker  leider hatte sich der Feta-Grill-Käse schon komplett mit der Alufolie verbunden, das Putensteak war noch trockener als es eigentlich vermeidbar hätte sein können und die Backkartoffel war ein zerschrumpeltes Mini-Häufchen-Elend. Mit zwei Leuten am Grillstand müsste eigentlich mehr frische Zubereitung drin sein. Nachdem das Restaurant schon längere Zeit in Betrieb ist, dürfen solche Anfängerfehler nicht mehr sein. Wir schließen uns dem Vorredner an: Was für eine Vorlage  BITTE MACHT WAS DRAUS!!!!!",4
Restaurants,"Chillige Location im Tiefgestade in Durlach mit ausreichend Parkmöglichkeiten. Geile Außenanlage in Strandoptik mit verschiedenen Sitzgelegenheiten. Darunter auch Liegen und Strandklappstühle. Weiterhin ist direkt ein kleiner Kinderspielplatz mit Trampolin angeschlossen, perfekt für Familien. Da bei unserem Besuch sehr labiles Wetter angesagt war und die Location sicher von der Sonne lebt war entsprechend wenig los. Ich hoffe nicht das nur aus diesem Grund der Service schnell und einfach nur super nett und toll war. Denn böse Zungen behaupten bei Betrieb auch schon mal eine halbe Stunde auf ein Getränk gewartet zu haben. Die optimale, kompakte Essens Karte lässt mehr erwarten als schließlich kam. Standard Curry Wurst ohne Pfiff oder Idee. Ebenso der Straßburger Wurstsalat. Fast gemein der matschige Aktions-Salat der nach ein paar wohlwollenden Gabeln einfach keine Change gegen die ruhmlose Curry Wurst mit Pommes hatte. Geile Location die im Sommer sicher riesig Spaß macht. Da kommt man sicher gerne auch nur zum Bier oder Cocktail. Auf Kalorien im Teller kann auch mal verzichtet werden.",4
Restaurants,"Das HubRaum ist für mich die Sommerkneipe in Durlach. Schön ruhig und im Grünen gelegen, bietet es reichlich Parkplätze, die aber auch belegt sind wenn das Lokal voll wird. Das Ambiente mit dem Sandbereich ist einzigartig und so fühlt man sich auch gleich richtig wohl. Wir waren schon zu zweit und in einer größeren Gruppe dort und fandes jedesmal alles prima. Auch das Essen war immer lecker obwohl oder vielleicht auch weil die Speisekarte nicht zu umfangreich ist. Komisch ist jedoch, wieso gibt es weniger Wurstsalat, wenn als Beilage noch Pommes mitbestellt werden? :-( 
Wir hatten fünf Portionen am Tisch und das war schon sehr auffällig.",2
Restaurants,"Ich bin in meinem Urteil noch unentschlossen. Das Restaurant hat einen wunderschönen Aussenbereich im Stil einer Strandbar. Mein Essen war sehr lecker. Die Speisekarte ist klein, was nicht heißt sie ist schlecht. Der Service ist dagegen wirklich nicht gut. Da geht zu viel schief. Essen spät und auch mal garnicht. Grosses Potenzial das nicht gehoben wird. Schauen wir mal, bekommt von mir zumindest noch eine Chance.",4
Restaurants,"Waren  zum ersten Mal im Hubraum zu Gast. Haben es in einer Tageszeitung gelesen,das Restaurant
mit dem Strandfeeling. Das Ambiente war okay, das Essen soweit auch,doch die Bedienung lässt zu Wünschen übrig. Ziemlich unfreundlich. Gehen sicher nicht noch mal dort hin. Die Einmalspeisekarte aus Papier war von einem anderen Gast wohl schon als Tischset benützt worden. Was wir nicht sehr appetitlich fanden.",3
Restaurants,"Die Location ist Super schön! Geschicklichkeit ist das Essen auch Super. Nur den negative Bewertungen über Service muss ich leider zustimmen. Wir waren zu zweit dort, als meine Begleitung komplett fertig war mit essen kam mein Gericht!

Restaurants,"Ich bin am 21. Juli mit Freunden das erste Mal im hubRaum gewesen. Die telefonische Reservierung ist reibungslos und freundlich verlaufen. Die Lage ist wirklich etwas außerhalb, mein Navi hatte mich erst in die Irre geführt, aber wenn man sich bißchen in Durlach auskennt, findet man es dann relativ schnell. Das Personal war sehr nett, teilweise etwas überfordert. Die Getränke kamen zügig, was man vom Essen gar nicht sagen kann. Sage und schreibe 40 Minuten haben wir auf unseren Salat warten müssen - ein No Go! Als er dann endlich kam, musste ich echt anfangen zu lachen. So eine Mini-Portion  für über 12 Euro!!! Dann hatte ich dazu einen Zitronengras-Spieß mit Meeresfrüchten und Lachs erwartet (wie in der Speisekarte beschrieben). Es war ein normaler Holzspieß mit 2 Garnelen und einem Stück Lachs  einfach lächerlich. Weil wir alle danach noch Hunger hatten, haben wir einen Flammkuchen bestellt. Der kam dann auch erst nach 30 Minuten, obwohl man uns gesagt hätte, dass er in 10 Minuten gebracht wird. Alles in allem würde ich nur noch mal hingehen, wenn man in einer sommerlichen Urlaubsatmosphäre was trinken gehen will.",2
Restaurants,Viele haben es schon geschrieben. Die Location ist top. Nirgendwo sitzt man schöner in Karlsruhe! Tolles Ambiente abseits der Stadt. Keine Schickeria aus dem P10. Ich hätte gerne 5 Sterne gegeben. Jedoch scheitert es am Service und dem Preis. Man muss Geduld mitbringen denn es kann etwas dauern. Personal ist jedoch sehr freundlich! Die Preise haben es in sich. Es sollte entweder die Portion vergrößert oder der Preis verkleinert werden. Dann passts. :),3
Restaurants,"Allgemein
Ich habe mich mit einer Freundin zum letzten Vorrundenspiel der deutschen Mannschaft gegen USA dort verabredet. Gleich nach dem Einlass begann der obligarorische Run auf die besten Plätze. Davon waren aber genügend vorhanden, so das auch später eintreffende Gäste immer noch Platz fanden um das Spiel zu sehen. 
Leider konnte ich meine Getränkebestellung erst 30 Minten nach Eintreffen platzieren. Die angesprochene Kellnerin war sehr bemüht, hatte zuvor aber versucht uns auf ihre Kollegin zu vertrösten die augenscheinlich aber nicht zum Dienst erschienen war oder sich einen anderen Bereich ausgesucht hatte. Hier fehlt ganz klar die richtige Zuweisung und Oragnisation durch die Führung. Dies zeigte sich auch bei der Speisenversorgung die an diesem ""Spieltag"" als Selbstbedienung erfolgen sollte. Die angeblichen Grillgerichte waren ein Schnitzelweck,Bockwurst und Flammkuchen. Das es hier zu Verzögerungen kam kann man sich leicht vorstellen.
Das eigentliche Negativerlebnis waren die horrenden Preise: Ein Hefe kostete 4,10 €, ein Radler 0,4 L 3,60 €, eine Apfelschorle 0,4 L wiederum 4,10 €. Hier wurde offensichtlich versucht am Hype um die Nationalmannschaftsspiele richtig Kasse zu machen. Dies funktioniert aber nicht mit lahmen Kellnern und fehlender Oragnisation. Viel schlimmer noch: damit gewinnt man keine Stammgäste!
Wir müssen da nicht mehr hin!
Bedienung
Die Bedienungen waren nett und freundlich, aber typisch für Aushilfen: unorganisiert und daher langsam.
Das Essen
Bockwurst und ein Stück Baguette - da spar ich mir die Kritik...
Das Ambiente
Das Strandambiente war überaus lässig und cool!
Der Innenraum wirkt veraltet und hätte eine Generalüberholung nötig.",3

Leider waren zum gestrigen Abendessen fast alle Sitzkissen (vom Regen in der Vor-Nacht) eher feucht-nass, als bequem und trocken. Die Speisekarte ist klein und fein: Salate, verschiedene Flammkuchen, Burger und auch eine schöne Kinderkarte. Ein Spielplatz ist direkt am Gelände zu finden mit Riesentrampolin und Rutschbahn. Die Qualität ist gerade noch so in Ordnung- jedoch sind wir weit entfernt von einer gesunden Küche, die das Essen frisch zubereitet. Auch der Service könnte um Welten besser sein- auf die Anfrage hin andere als bestellte Getränke auf den Tisch zu bekommen würden wir heute noch auf die gewünschte Rückmeldung warten. Sehr schade!

Restaurants,"Gestern mal wieder da gewesen. Draußen gesessen.
Convenience-Food war dementsprechend mittelmäßig aber entsprach den Erwartungen,
Sonnenuntergang mit Autobahnhintergrundgeräusch als Meeresrauschenersatz und letztes Beachfeeling der Saison war in Ordnung.",3
Restaurants,"Mit einer 6er Gruppe im Rahmen der Dinner & Dance-Reihe dort gewesen - absolute Katastrophe. Die junge Bedienung schien überfordert, vielleicht einer ihrer ersten Tage? Der Restaurantleiter, wenn er es denn überhaupt war, war relativ bemüht, hat es am Ende aber nur schlimmer gemacht und uns den Abend versaut.

Der Abend begann um 19 Uhr, wir hatten reserviert. Vor Ort hat man unsere Reservierung nicht gefunden, obwohl ich auf Wunsch des Lokals extra am Vortag nochmals angerufen und die Reservierung bestätigt hatte. Egal, wir hatten trotzdem einen Tisch. 3 von uns hatten Vorspeisen bestellt, nur 2 Vorspeisen kamen. Nach 20 min kam dann endlich die 3. Vorspeise, ein Fetakäse, der keiner war. Dem Restaurant scheint nicht bewusst zu sein, dass Käse aus Kuhmilch kein Feta ist... Nach den Vorspeisen hat es fast 1 Stunde gedauert, bis wir dann unser Essen bekamen! Da war es dann schon 21 Uhr und wir waren seit 2 Stunden dort. Ironischerweise schien es fürs Servicepersonal kein Problem zu geben, denn wir wurden innerhalb dieser einen Stunde immer wieder standardmäßig gefragt, ob noch alles recht sei. Offensichtlich nicht! Wir verhungern! Und das Lokal war nur halb besetzt. Der Restaurantleiter hat uns irgendwann mittendrin versichert, dass er die Lage in der Küche gerade gecheckt hat, das Essen käme in wenigen Minuten. Aus wenigen Minuten wurden weitere 30 und damit war die Stunde Wartezeit voll. Obwohl er ja scheinbar die Lage in der Küche gerade selbst überprüft hatte, haben wir beobachtet, wie der Restaurantleiter irgendwann die junge Bedienung fragte, was unser Tisch eigentlich bestellt hat. Ernsthaft jetzt?? 

Irgendwann kam endlich unser Essen, es schien bergauf zu gehen! Weit gefehlt. Die Pommes waren ranzig, das Wiener Schnitzel seine knapp 18€ keineswegs Wert, die Scampi noch roh und ein Gericht war völlig falsch. Gegessen wurde es natürlich trotzdem, der Hunger war schließlich da! Geschmeckt hat es nicht. Der Restaurantleiter hat sich mehrfach entschuldigt und beteuert, dass es ihm persönlich sehr am Herzen läge, wenn wir am Ende zufrieden das Haus verlassen. Haha, dafür war es nun schon etwas spät, oder nicht? Aufgrund der ellenlangen Wartezeit und des dann auch noch falsch gelieferten Essens, haben wir einen Dessertteller umsonst bekommen. Weil wir danach gefragt hatten. Nicht, weil es uns aus Höflichkeit angeboten wurde. Beim Bezahlen hat der Restaurantleiter dann nochmals betont, dass der Dessertteller nicht auf der Rechnung auftaucht, woraufhin wir sagten, dass das ja wohl auch selbstverständlich sei, nach diesem schlechten Service. Wir mussten uns dann anhören, dass man sich wenigstens bedanken könnte, das würde sich ja so gehören. Bitte was??? Wofür bedanken? Für die vergessene Vorspeise? Für die Wartezeit von 1 Stunde? Für die bestellte Maispoularde, die als halbgares Rumpsteak gebracht wurde? Für den zwar kostenlosen, aber furchtbaren Dessertteller? Für die dreckigen Gläser und schmutzige Speisekarte? Für die verschlampte Reservierung? Für einen Abend, der zu zweit 55€ gekostet hat, war das ein absoluter Reinfall.

Auf keinen Fall wieder. Dafür, dass es DINNER & Dance hieß, war es echt eine Katastrophe. Wie schwer kann es sein, zu dritt ca. 10-12 Tische zu bedienen und die Essen gleichzeitig (und korrekt) zu kochen? Und dann solche Preise zu verlangen (Hauptgerichte ab 15€ aufwärts), ist eine Frechheit.",1
Restaurants,"Über das etwas befremdende Außenambiente und die für ein Restaurant vielleicht nicht ideale Lage wurde ja schon hinreichend geschrieben.
Innen ist es zwar dann tatsächlich sauber, nett & geschmackvoll eingerichtet beim Blick aus dem Fenster kommt aber halt trotzdem keine rechte Candlelight-Atmosphäre auf.
Eher solide deutsche Basisküche (Salate, Steaks, Schnitzelgerichte) als Haute Cuisine aber es hat geschmeckt. Zudem ein sehr realistisches Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis: ich kenne deutlich teurere Restaurants, bei denen Spätzle & Knödel nicht selbstgemacht sind, man wird vermutlich weder hungrig noch arm aus dem Zeitlos gehen. 
Nette Bedienung, die Zeit zwischen den Gängen hätte vielleicht etwas niedriger liegen können.
Äußerst erfreuliche Nachtisch-Größe: aus meiner Panna Cotta hätte man andernorts vielleicht zwei Portionen gemacht.
Maracuja-Weizen hab ich sonst noch nirgendwo im Angebot gesehen und das Sonntags angebotene Schlemmer-Frühstück klingt verheißungsvoll werden wir sicher mal austesten.",4

Essen: Ich hatte eine Rinderleberpfanne  Leber gebraten mit Tomaten-Sahnesauce, Champignons, Zwiebeln, mit Retsina-Wein verfeinert, dazu Pommes und im Vorfeld einen Beilagensalat (schon der war sehr groß).
Mein Mann hatte einen Resinateller  Souvlaki, Lammkotelett, Hacksteak, Putensteak, frischer Knoblauch, Petersilie, Tsatsiki und Tomatenreis.
Wir essen gerne und oft Griechisch aber das war der Hammer, es war total lecker und das wird jetzt unser Lieblingsgrieche.
Wer die griechische Küche nicht mag  dort gibt es auch die italienische Küche, Pizza frisch vom Holzofen, Pasta usw. Was ich gesehen habe an Pizzen war echt toll auch die waren super groß (man kann auch anrufen bestellen und abholen).
Ein Tipp : Wir waren um 17.45 Uhr dort und haben den letzten Tisch bekommen, alle anderen waren reserviert, wer am WE dort essen will unbedingt reservieren.",5
Restaurants,"Allgemein
Da wir das Hellas-Salute aus Friedrichstal kennen und gehört haben, dass in Karlsruhe, der mittlerweile 4. Ableger des Restaurant geöffnet hat, wollten wir unbedingt das neue Lokal sehen. Wir saßen auf der Terrasse / Biergarten, der geräumig vor dem Lokal auf seine Gäste wartet.
Bedienung
Sehr höflich und freundlich wurden wir begrüßt und bedient. Sehr angenehme umgangsformen. Zu unseren Bestellungen wurden Alternativen angeboten, was Beilagen betrifft, was ebenfalls sehr nett war. Rundum ein sehr netter Service!
Das Essen
Die Karte ist recht umfangreich. Viele Pizza und Pasta-Gerichte, außerdem griechische Gerichte, Fisch und Fleisch Gerichte, Salate, Vorspeisen (kalt & warm), Kindergerichte, sowie Senioren Gerichte werden angeboten. Fast etwas zu umfangreich. Aber gut. Wir haben uns entschieden. Meine Begleitung wählte die warme Vorspeise Sardinen (6,10€) direkt zu ihrem großen Italia Salat (6,50€). Ich entschied mich für den Souvlakiteller (11,90€). Vor dem Souvlakiteller kam ein kleiner Beilagensalat mit verschiedenen Blattsalaten, Olive, Pepperoni, Ei, Karotten, Tomaten, Gurken, Mais mit einem Joghurt-Dressing und frischen Kräutern. Insgesamt frisch und lecker. Zu unseren Hauptgerichten wurde zusätzlich warmes griechisches Fladenbrot gereicht. Der Italia-Salat war klassisch, ähnlich dem Beilagensalat nur größer und zusätzlich mit Schinken- und Käse-Streifen. Die Sardinen waren mit einer guten Portion Tzaziki angerichtet. Der Souvlakiteller bestand aus einem Stück gegrillter Rinderleber, einem Souvlakispieß (Schweine Rückenstücke gegrillt auf einem Metallspieß), sowie einem Bifteki (griechische Schweinefrikadelle), rotem griechischem Langkornreis mit Erbsen und ebenfalls einem kräftigen Kleks Tzaziki. Alles samt lecker und gut. Das Fleisch war nach dem Grillen mit etwas Olivenöl-Kräuter-Marinade bestrichen worden. Auch meine Belgeitung war zufrieden mit Salat und Fisch. Wir kommen gerne mal wieder!
Das Ambiente
Schlicht und einfach. Die Terrasse direkt an der Strasse gelegen. Daher leichter Abzug. Aber trotzdem einladend.

Hier gibt es nichts zu bemängeln.",4
Restaurants,"Ich war zum ersten Mal im ""Hellas Salute"" und war leider nicht beeindruckt. Die Kombination italienisch-griechisch ist ja nicht schlecht. Zwei Küchen die ich gerne mag. Auch das Ambiente ist schön. Ein sehr gepflegtes Restaurant dass offenbar vor nicht allzu langer Zeit renoviert wurde.

Mein Begleiter versicherte mir schon mehrmals, dass das Essen dort gut sei und so war ich gespannt. Auf italienisch hatte ich keine Lust, also nahm ich eine eine der typischen Mixteller die man überall in griechischen Restaurants bekommt. Leider schmeckte alles darauf sehr beliebig und alles fast gleich. Das bekomme ich bei meinem Lieblings-Griechen in Linkenheim wesentlich besser.

Auch nicht beeindruckend war der Service. Erst bekamen wir nur einen Salat statt zwei. Der zweite Salat fand sich dann am Nachbartisch wieder. Dann sollte uns ein Nachtisch serviert werden obwohl wir keinen bestellt hatten. Immer wieder gab es Missverständnisse, Speisen an allen den Nachbartischen wurden falsch serviert  (""Hatten Sie den Fisch?""). Selten habe ich einen so konfusen Service erlebt.

Alles in allem keine Empfehlung. Ich gehe nicht wieder hin.",2
Restaurants,"Heute Mittag habe ich das Memo probiert und einen Yufka Döner bestellt.


 Das Restaurant ist nett eingerichtet und sauber. Es gibt einen Holzofen und der Inhaber ist sehr nett, man fühlt sich wohl.


 Dennoch von mir nur 3 Sterne, da ich mir EUR 4,00 für einen Hackfleisch Döner zu teuer erscheinen. Im Vergleich zum Aroma auf der Kriegsstr. zum Beispiel, bin ich weniger begeistert.


 Die Hygiene in dem Laden ist sicherlich einwandfrei, allerdings würde ich mir nach jedem Kontakt mit Kleingeld wünschen, dass die Hände gewaschen würden, bevor mein Yufka gerollt wird.

Wir entschlossen uns für ein Platz draußen und waren vom Ambiente gleich begeistert. Auch die Bedienung war sehr flott und freundlich. Die Speisekarte ist sehr übersichtlich, aber es findet sich für jeden Gaumen ein Essen. Wir entschieden uns für den Salat mit dem Rumpsteak. Das Essen war sehr ansehnlich dekoriert und äusserst schmackhaft. Es gab nichts zu beanstanden. Lediglich am Abend hatten wir beide Magenprobleme, ob jedoch zu diesem Essen ein Zusammenhang bestand, ist fraglich. Aus diesem Grunde nur 4 Sterne vorerst. Aber... wir kommen wieder! :-)

 Ich hatte einen Grieß-Kirsche-Kuchen (3,00), der weder nach Grieß, noch nach Kirsche schmeckte. Der Frankfurter Kranz (3,50) war auch nichts besonderes, aber in Ordnung.",3
Restaurants,"05.09.13 Ein wunderbares Lokal, vor allem wenn man bei Sonne draussen im Schatten sitzt und die vorbeidefilierenden Leute beobachten kann.",4
Restaurants,"Ich war heute zum ""Testessen"" im Außenbereich. Test bestanden, komme mit meinen Kollegen in ein paar Tagen wieder. Trotz Hitze habe ich den Rostbraten verspeist. Sehr lecker und auf dem Punkt, den Bratkartoffeln fehlte etwas Röstung. Der Salat war frisch und als Beilage absolut ok. Der Service war freundlich, das Bier kühl. Punktabzug gibts nur weil ich allergisch auf verstopfte Gläser mit gemahlenem Pfeffer reagiere. Meiner Meinung nach hat der Gast immer eine Pfeffermühle verdient, sofern er sich außerhalb des Spelunkenniveaus bewegt.
Ambiente: toll",4
Arts & Entertainment,"I went to see Meat Loaf tonight and I liked the show a lot.  He did a wide range of his songs and he did the one I was hoping he would perform--Paradise By the Dashboard Lights.

I really didn't know who Meat Loaf was until I had to chaperone dances as high school principal.  Almost every dance, the girls, especially, would request the DJ play Paradise.  The girls sang the lyrics...""Will you love me..."" and the boys would respond with ""...let me think on it...""  That's when I knew who Meat Loaf was.  My musical tastes had diverged from rock after graduate school and the beginning of working for a living.  ""Paradise"" was well done tonight and I brought back so many good memories.

I was surprised to know that Meat Load did the music for Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Seriously, folks, I have not lived under a rock for the last 30 years or so.  It's just that I knew the name and didn't associate his name with some of the music.

Near the end of the show, they have some large artificial penises from which they shoot T-shirts.  I caught one tonight.  The little lady next to me thought she was going to get.  Afraid not, sweetheart.  I hope your black and blue goes away soon!   The shirt says ""I Saw Meat Loaf in Las Vegas.""  Now I'm glad I went.  Wait, I live here!

This is a show I could easily see again.  It's very enjoyable and Meat Loaf really puts all his energy into a good 2 hour performance.  There was one complaint I had about the show.  He proved his Indian name was correct!  Now you have to go see the show to know what I mean!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"The Jacksons recently took over this showroom at Planet Hollywood. Who knew....or remembered the depth of talent this family has. The show was amazing, entertaining and tight. The Jackson's matriarch was there to support her boys and they done her proud. I have to admit these were comp tickets and I wouldn't have gone if they weren't free but boy would I have missed a great show. Sadly, they aren't selling tickets so they are closing on Sunday.....3 weeks early. Try to catch them this weekend before they are out of here. You will be dancin' in your seat! Thanks for the memories!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"WOW! I am so sad they are leaving!  THE JACKSONS WERE OUTSTANDING! I couldn't get enough of Marlin! They sounded great, looked great, and put on a show! I had a hard time staying in my seat, and what a treat that night, The whole family minus Randy and Janet were there, Santana was there, oh yeah Cris Angel was there. So glad I went to the show!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"We attended this show starring Meat Loaf recently.  Meat has a history of vocal problems, but he was in good voice this evening until the closing number when he became a little hoarse.  The show is very entertaining with excellent background graphics, dancers and musicians.  He does an very good job during the question and answer period.  Most of his biggest hits were covered which was the highlight for me.  I would not recommend this show for children due to the language he uses and the artificial penis used to catapult T-shirts into the audience.",4
Arts & Entertainment,"Go meat loaf!!!! One of the most fun shows I've been to in Vegas... And I live here!! Enjoyed his humor/comedy as much as his songs/performance! Rocked on for a solid 2 hours with no intermission. 66 years old & still going strong. His voice gave out a little here and there, but that didn't matter because his showmanship made up for it & so did his awesome backup singers/band.. Lots of audience interaction & is in a very intimate setting. Loved it!! Exceeded my expectations.",5
Arts & Entertainment,Overall loved both meat loaf and the Jackson's show here.  Great showroom and good production. Both shows were great performances by the artists.  Good service and value for coctails.,5
Arts & Entertainment,Saw meat loaf here. The show was entertaining but meat loaf can't sing as well as he used to. The drinks are a little pricy but normal for the strip. The staff was really strict about no cell phone usage whatsoever.,3
Arts & Entertainment,I went to see meat loaf like a week ago.  Overall I was entertained (mostly due to the drink person behind me who kept yelling out insane things).   Meat loaf might possibly have the worst voice I have ever heard in my life.  He sounded so bad.   Time to retire for sure.  The band was good and the background singers were solid as well.   He did a bunch of comedy and told stories that we mediocre at best.  I got these tickets for free and still questioned if it was worth the time or not. He has a bunch of good songs but he truly does butcher them.   Ouch.,2
Arts & Entertainment,"We went last night with low expectations and were wowed.  A lot of reviewers commented on his voice, no, I don't think it is as good as it used to be but Meat Loaf put his all into the over 2 hour show.  I expected more of a bland concert visually and was thrilled to see all his added treats!  Yes, tap dancers!  i agree both the background singers and band were amazing.",4
Arts & Entertainment,I liked Meat Loaf and am a big fan. My only gripe was that he is getting a bit too old to be performing but everything else was great and I thought for his age his sure did do a good job.,4
Arts & Entertainment,"I went to see Meat Loaf last week. I find the variety of the other reviews interesting. I don't disagree at all with Diane B, for example, that Meat really can't sing. Last time I saw him live, in 2007, he couldn't sing either. I don't think that really takes away from the show though, because the background singers are great (and really seem to take over in most of the songs so the music sounds good). He plays old favorites, other than maybe wanting to hear Two Outta Three Ain't Bad, I think I heard everything I really wanted to, without many obscure songs. I liked the variety in the show, although certain things probably lasted a bit long.

Keep in mind that this is a 2nd tier Vegas show to begin with. The graphics looked like they were done up on some computer program from the '90s. But who cares, the music is good, and most of all Meat still has that stage presence and is fun to listen to talk. I had a blast!",4
Arts & Entertainment,"For crying out loud, Meat Loaf, you know I love you. Seeing Meat loaf in concert has long been on my wish list. This was my chance. It is more like an evening with Meat Loaf and not really a concert, which is OK. He is not a young loaf anymore. He sang most of his big hits including a few off of Bat out of Hell and his tune from Rocky Horror. I wish he would have sang 2 out of 3 Aint Bad or For Crying out Loud, but he can't do them all. 

Meat Loaf if you are reading this... I understand you don't have the energy to sing and rock like you used to, so keep the stories behind the music, but dump the opening skit. Now look and me and read it and weep.",3
Arts & Entertainment,"This is one giant duck, the rubber ducky is in Pittsburgh for three weeks as part of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's 'Festival of Firsts,"" It's the big rubber duck's first visit to North America after visits to Sydney, Hong Kong, Paris, and other notable cities. Florentijn Hofman is the artist who designed the 40x30 duck. Moored on the Allegheny River side of Point State Park, near the fountain.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Rubber Ducky, you're the one
You make Pittsburgh, so much fun...

Seriously, you quack me up.

Something about a giant rubber duck that makes the grumpiest of people smile.  To walk down here in the dark is somewhat mesmerizing.  There are hoards of people everywhere to see the monster.  

Flashes flashing, people giggling, smiles everywhere.  I mean who could resist taking a selfie with the rubber ducky?  I know I didn't.

This is a nice addition, even though the duck won't be a permanent resident.  I assume because it'll be flying south soon.",5
Arts & Entertainment,epic ginormous duck!,5
Arts & Entertainment,"We came.  We saw.  And we couldn't stop staring, smiling and laughing.  This duck is just so dang cute.  Even the real ducks on the river couldn't get enough, they were trying to surround him.

We showed up at the crack of dawn to avoid the crowd.  Didn't help, people were already there.  Everyone wants to see the duck.  Everyone wants their picture with the duck.  The duck don't care.  He just sits there and occasionally bobs on the water.

I heard that over 1 million people showed up to see our huge waterfowl friend.  A huge thanks to Florentijn Hofman, the Dutch artist who has brought joy to so many with a simple bathtub friend turned into the size of Godzilla.  And thanks to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust for having the ingenuity to get this brilliant yellow drake temporarily nested on our Allegheny.

Sad to think of the duck closed up in some warehouse until January.  And even sadder to think that he may never grace our city, again!  But I also can't wait to see where our friend shows up next.",5
Arts & Entertainment,This thing was ducktastic! I only wish they'd have dressed it up in Pirates gear for the playoffs. Definitely worth seeing in person and very cool that it chose to roost in Pittsburgh for a while.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"As of yesterday, despite petitions begging for him to stay just a while longer, the Pittsburgh Rubber Duck is gone - towed away to be stored for potential future uses, the Cultural Trust has teased.

He will be sorely missed. Seeing a Rubber Duck splashing in the river made many, many locals and even some out of towners very happy. Children laughed, adults smiled, and business boomed: lots of business owners said that every day the Duck was here was like the Pittsburgh Regatta was in town. Every day! Food sold out in every restaurant, duck related merchandise flew off the shelves, and local downtown museums saw a massive increase in the number of visitors they usually get this time of year. 

It was amazing to see just how many people visited downtown and how lively it became. It's hard to say which was bigger: the waves of happiness rolling throughout the Point while this Duck floated happily nearby, or economic boom downtown created by the duck's presence. 

Either way, the Duck made quite a splash while it was here. and I hope one day we'll get the chance to see this simply marvelous piece of work in the rivers again!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Awww. I miss the rubber ducky. Darren I saw it when it was still here before a concert. It was a fun, cute sight to behold. I hope people in other cities get to see it.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"If you give this less than five stars, you probably don't have a soul.

I came to visit my friend and it just coincidentally coincided with the duck's appearance in the river. 

I love this type of art - it's so charming and positive. I mean, how can you dislike it? I've never seen any other art installation have such positive cache. If anyone had tried to vandalize it, I'm sure they would've been subjected to some of the worst public ostracization (is that a word?) possible.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I made a special trip up to Pittsburgh to see this little guy and it was worth it! I'm a huge rubber duck aficionado. I've been collecting rubber ducks for years and years now and have accumulated a collection of over 200 in rubber ducks alone (haven't even attempted to count the other duck paraphernalia I've acquired over the years). When I heard about the Rubber Duck Project by Florentijn Hofman and saw the sculpture in Sydney, Hong Kong, and Beijing this year in the news, I fell in love with this Rubber Duck. I was beyond ecstatic when I heard it was coming to the US and even more excited when I heard it would be making its US debut on the East Coast, just 4 hours from where I live. 

""The Rubber Duck knows no frontiers, it doesn't discriminate people and doesn't have a political connotation."" Hence why when I was there, so were hundreds of people, young and old, female and male, of all races, gathered to see this majestic, whimsical sculpture. The Rubber Duck is the most charming and delightful friend you'll meet. It doesn't even have to talk for you to smile. No joke, I sat there and gazed at the duck for 30 minutes and just smiled at its simplicity and playfully quaint nature. 

After taking dozens of photos, I purchased three things at the official merchandise stand - a poster, a replica, and a sticker (I would have bought everything but only had $20 in cash with me at the time). After browsing online at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust website, I purchased a T-shirt, cap, and pin - essentially every available merchandise. No regrets though! These are collectibles worth collecting (especially for me, one of the biggest rubber duck fans out there). 

Rubber Duck, you are definitely the one and you made Pittsburgh so much fun!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I was sorry to see the duck go. It was public art that almost everyone could relate to.  I'm thinking we will have other similar opportunities, because we had the marvelous knit bridge in picture the same summer.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"I love that the Rubber Duck has a page where you can review him!

What else can you say about the duck other than the fact that he is awesome?!  What is not to love about a giant rubber duck?  Stories about the duck indicated that the artist wanted to create something that reminded us of the whimsy of childhood.  Mission accomplished.  

I first saw the duck on the night of his debut.  Downtown was bustling with activity as there were several events going on (along with the duck's arrival and bridge party).  I was giddy with excitement as we approached him.  It was a picture perfect evening and he looked incredible with PNC Park as a backdrop.  It was nice to see so many boaters paying him a visit as well.

I was fortunate to see the duck every morning on my way in to work.  And it brought a smile to my face ever time.

Confession time.  I loved the duck so much that when we heard his next appearnce was in Norfolk, VA, we made arrangements to pick up the nieces and nephews and take a road trip to visit him.  Still brought me just as much joy.  Maybe even more since I also had the experience of sharing him with kids.

I hope he makes a return to Pittsburgh soon!",5
Public Services & Government,"Came to visit my brother and come to find there are no visits on Saturday, only Sundah and Monday, seems kind of ass backwards to me. The desk person seemed removed and cold, not very knowledgable or professional. The machine where you put money into your inmates account was slow and did not give us any confirmation or receipt to let us know the money even went through, also, there was an almost $8 fee to process the deposit SMH. Fortunately we were able to meet a nice older couple who were having a hard time getting information about their son, I know, it's hard to believe that the desk person could be so useless. We were able to help them get the info they needed by speaking for them and calling the DOC on their behalf to inquire about their son. Not much was accomplished today as far as being able to visit with my brother and I am not too confident that the money will get to him, but at least we were able to help a nice couple find their son in this screwed up system. You'd think with all the funding Arpaio gets, he'd be able to do a better job of treating Arizona residents who find themselves in an unfortunate situation, and their loved ones, better.",1
Public Services & Government,"The food here is Horrible!! It tastes like old dog food, that's been warmed up.. The staff treat everyone, including visitors like they are above them.. The inside is disgusting, non compliant with codes, and overall just gross!! I'd recommend not going, and if u can't stay law abiding, do it in a different county!!",1
Public Services & Government,"The B checkpoint was the first one at Charlotte to get the TSA Pre-Check line. Once you're pre-approved by the right people, PreCheck means that you get to skip the radiation machinery, keep your shoes on, keep your laptop in your bag and pretty much zip through the security process. I've had it take as little as three minutes. Awesome.

Unfortunately, PreCheck is no longer as exclusive as it used to be. Where it was only for seasoned travelers, it's now Ma and Pa if the feds deem them to be a minimal security risk that they can experience a reduced screening. So the queue is now beyond ten minutes while these folks who rarely travel try to work out that their cell phone sets off the machine and they can't bring a two little bottle of Coke with them on their trip.

Sometimes, the TSO shouts at the passengers to remove all metal objects. Sometimes, they're more polite. Hit or miss.

Charlotte is a single security zone, so once you're through security you can go to any gate or terminal in the airport. Just because your flight is at the E concourse, you can still use the B checkpoint if the line is shorter. Enjoy!",4
Public Services & Government,"Don't do it. While it's true that if your plane is departing from the A concourse that this is the closest security checkpoint, you'll be better off heading over to B or even C if there is a long line here at A. Sure the security is the same at all of them, but the line seems to go faster with better and more prepared travelers at the other gates.

Trust me. I'm the Duke.",1
Public Services & Government,I was almost surprised at how friendly I was received at this tsa checkpoint this morning. Whoa...I was through in like 2.5 minutes as well. Thanks TSA employees working there today 8/10/14 between 12-12:30.,5
Public Services & Government,Obviously the TSA is trying to make a point to enlarge their budget by slowing down the traveling public. Every airport has longer lines and more congestion. The TSA has forgot who the customer is . The checkpoint at the far right was the shortest.,1
Public Services & Government,"Would give it 0 stars, but I did find one nice employee. Gordon the ""supervisor"" is a joke.  No customer service skills at all!   Give someone a uniform and a badge and they think they are GOD.  All TSA employees should be required to watch the Stanford Prison Experiment.",1
Public Services & Government,"For the last year or so, when I fly, I've been flying Delta. At Charlotte's airport, the primary carrier is US Airways and they have relegated pretty much everyone else (Delta, United, American, Southwest) to the A concourse. And since everything in Charlotte is connected once you're through security, I usually use the B security checkpoint since it has a line not only for the elite/preferred customers but they also have one for the TSA Precheck folks.

But for this trip, I was flying on US Air out of the E concourse and so I chose to have my security theater performed at the D/E checkpoint which also has a TSA Precheck line. My security officer was quite and efficient when he violated my rights.

As a TSA Precheck traveler, I get to keep my shoes on, my laptop stays in my bag and I don't have to put my hands in the air and get irradiated very often. If you travel much, I strongly suggest that you sign up for the Global Entry program ($100), which gets you a Known Traveler number that you enter into your air ticket purchase. This gets you a very good chance of pre-check and the above listed security ""bypass"" stuff.

I love this airport!",4
Public Services & Government,"So...I've never had any issues with a TSA. I checked online and called way before hand. I was thusly informed I could take small liquids onto the plane as I need to take medications. Well, TSA at Concourse A apparently didn't get that memo. I walked down to Concourse B TSA spot. Found a manager type. Also found 2 more TSA people that knew liquids are allowed thru only for medication. I complained and was informed they'd speak to them about it since I was pissed off. Really aggravating!  If you're not allowing then don't. If you do allow, then stop with the gray areas, test liquids, and get out my way!  Ugh!",2
Public Services & Government,"The TSA here... especially pre-check are the rudest most miserable I have come against in the USA... have and do frequent many airports and CLT is by far the worst for TSA courtesy..   

somebody should train staff to interact better with what are Airport Customers..      

they are meant on the most part.... a few exceptions only.. 

we have no choice. will try my best to stay away from D and E security check...",1
Public Services & Government,"Tell your Congressman that Global Entry  program is a scam, designed solely to take more of your money.  Eager to take your $100 but website doesn't identify that the entire process can take many months.  No interview appointments available until after our vacation on August 17.  Can try walk-in in the event of a cancellation, but probability of success is low.  Still trying to understand why this program might save anyone time at security.  Submitted application in April but no appointments until after September.  Honesty is still the best policy.",1
Public Services & Government,"Poorly laid out, poorly organized, inefficient, lousy attention to us-their clients-and overall a typical bad security experience.  No worries, though, TSA is pretty similar at most airports.  2 stars for having TSA Pre-check!",2
Public Services & Government,"No pre allowed at 0430 for gates ab if no paper boarding pass.  Standard rules apply because I used a phone for boarding pass. Told to go to terminal cd checkin otherwise shoes off and laptop out of the bag etc. Totally unexpected. Pre checkin at cd swamped with only one checker until 0500.  OTOH I got 1600 steps in this morning hiking back and forth between the places.  

At other tsa pre where we were comingled because it was too early in the morning, we were given a paper pass to avoid taking shoes and coats off, but we still had to take laptops out which is still a drag.",1
Public Services & Government,"Some TSA employees are nice, most are mean. One employee showed he hated his job by yelling at the top lungs to everybody that the security requirements are the same as 10+ years ago over and over and that Bush and/or Obama put the security measures in place at that time. And the same man yelling those ridiculous rants yelled at me because I asked for a pat down. He said ""you are going in the scan line,"" in an authoritative manner 3x and I responded and repeated 2-3x that I cannot get scanned for health reasons.
Other times the longs are extremely long and there are maybe only 1-2 check ID point and scanners open. Is everyone on break at the same time or no one anticipates rush/holiday hours/days? Hopefully management can make TSA a better experience especially in Las Vegas.",2
Public Services & Government,"TSA agent just called me Mofo!
Yes, I was wearing a Mofo shirt! (See Morrison and Foerster Llp)

TSA has always treated me respectfully and have always been friendly every time I pass through McCarran...and there have been many times.

Thanks Guys and Gals of TSA!
Can I get Pre-Check now?",4
Public Services & Government,"I really felt violated and angry at the attitude of the TSA at this check point. I got yelled at for not knowing that there were two lines to check IDs. How am I supposed to know if there's no signs, and nobody says anything? 
There weren't enough bins to put my stuff in, but got griped at for waiting for one. 
It's amazing how little these people do. I counted a dozen TSA agents standing around socializing, doing nothing. When I eavesdropped in on them, they were laughing about how they took away a child's milk. 
How is it that liquids are a threat to national security, unless they're in a clear plastic bag? That bag is really going to save our country. 
Every time I go through here, it makes my blood boil with their invasive searches, and feel that my 4th Amendment rights have been violated. 
When we were going through here, we saw them taking away a poor guy's water that he said he needed for a medical condition. Meanwhile, they completely missed my lighters. Way to prioritize.
What a waste of my time, and tax payer dollars.",1
Public Services & Government,Very rude and arrogant employees.  They belittle you for not knowing what they are thinking.  They left a guy in a wheelchair who needed help to just sit there.  Tsa people joke with each other and do not take the job seriously.  We can hear you talking.,1
Public Services & Government,"Well I was so looking forward to this review, this terminal is pathetic, seriously with the amount of traffic coming through this terminal I would be embarrassed as an air carrier to have my gates in this terminal and I will never again fly an air carrier to Vegas that uses this terminal. 

First of all the TSA actually stopped the massive line of travelers 100 feet from the check points for more than 20 mins while the lines completely cleared there were only 2 check points that were operating out of the many. The TSA was so short handed they should have closed this terminal and canceled the flights. This was the most disorganized TSA crew I've may have ever experienced since their inception. The TSA Pre-check was absolutely useless on this day I witnessed some of the most incompetent behavior by the TSA anywhere and if you need me to qualify that statement my credentials are I normally have more than 100 flights a year. It was quite clear the security at this terminal on this Wednesday 9/30/15 was subpar and ineffective.",1
Public Services & Government,"I had a great experience at this TSA check point. There were plenty of metal detectors and agents on staff to make the screenings move quickly. The agents were relaxed, personable, and speedy. In fact, my screener told my to keep my shoes on. I was in and out in a split second. This was the greatest security screening I've ever been through; invasive body and luggage scans have never been so easy.",5
Public Services & Government,"So, last two weeks for some reason the TSA Pre is closed early. Upon inquiring, they are now closing TSA Pre at the T1 D-Gates at 8:00pm on Sunday evenings. So much for those of us taking the red eye!!! Staff is very professional and trying hard but there are not enough of them. What are they thinking!!!!",1
Public Services & Government,Very rude tsa female agent. The airport is fine..she could use a course in customer relations.,1
Public Services & Government,"With as much travel as I do, I know good airport security operations from bad ones. And the Terminal 1 ""D"" checkpoint at LAS is a cluster. One check-in person for both regular and Precheck. Long lines not moving. And when they opened another line for PreCheck, there was no clarity about how to navigate the rope lines to get from one queue to the other. So it was a mess.

That said, once my ID was checked and I somehow wasn't selected for additional ""random"" screening despite my attitude, it was speedy and I was able to get over to the regular line just as my Mom was coming through the regular screening.

Ugh. If I could go elsewhere, I would.",1
Public Services & Government,"I give these guys a zero rating. First of all the xray equipment is not a harmless thing especially if you travel a lot. The European association of radiologists has spoken about it negatively to say the least. Long term cancer for sure. When the tsa staff is trained to misinform the public by saying their uneducated collection of phrases. "" its harmless, its like passing through the light, its like radio, and etc. once he told me its ""atomic"". Really dude ? I like to know the definition of atomic. What do these people think? Like everyone is as dumb as a door knob?  In general the culture of their treatment is rude and disrespectful. I understand there are a lot of people going through the airport but being nice is not impossible. The moment you ask for mail or female assist is like someone asked them to burry their mother. Really how hard is it to move the chain of people efficiently. There are always an overabundance of people who are just hanging around using tax payer money. This time the person Wulf"" hit me pretty hard under the region. When i asked him you could do this more gentle as well he said i gotta do my job. Now a surgeon has to have a fine touch and gentle hands so it is possible to use finesse. In any case this review will not make them change anything but it is so sad that people have zero tolerance for others and no respect and self respect. The whole culture of the tsa is rude and the attitude is that everyone thinks they are entitled to not working.",1
Public Services & Government,"I had to deal with some rude, fat, slimy tsa guy. Yelling at me in an abusive way about moving my belongings through the X-ray area. Just because these people represent the Government , doesn't  give them the right to trample on the rights of others , or to be disrespectful to the traveling public. It really isn't a happy experience to fly anywhere these days & tsa  just makes it worse for everyone, especially when they start yelling & screaming. There are some people that just are not well suited for a position of authority, such as the fat & obnoxious man that I had to deal with. He probably is best being a circus entertainer, or performer in some street show with his over exaggerated & dramatic hand gestures & loud voice! Not a good representative of our Government!",1
Public Services & Government,"I would give a 1/2 or 1/4 star if I could... They were pushing us all through like cattle... Which is fine. I get it. But they pushed my bin faster than I was moving (and I don't move slow.. I want to board the plane). I tried putting my watch in at the last second but they hurried me saying I didn't need to... I said, ""But it's made of metal?!"" He insisted it didn't matter and waved me to get in line of the body scan. Then.. The guy next to him asks me to walk through the metal detector. But... Of course... I have my watch on. So, he now insists that I must now do what I wanted to do just 1 min ago. So.. There is no room for it, because they have been pushing everything through. They tell me to find a spot... Finally I do, and go through the metal detector. And I wait... Wait... And wait.... No Apple Watch. Of course my laptop bag gets flagged for further checking, so I keep looking for it. Eventually, I'm asking for help... This thing was a gift and worth $500... Which is why I wanted to put it with my own stuff earlier. Finally, a woman running the body scanner - wish I remembered her name - said ""There it is on the floor. Next time, look around."" At first, I thought she was talking to a co-worker that was helping me find it... But no... She was saying it to me. As if I have permission to crawl around, get in people's way, and look where it was found. I could not. So.. I asked her, ""Were you talking to me or him?"" - ""You! Look around."" ............. Asked her for her name - she was happy to show her badge and tell me where to find her supervisor. Apparently this happens often for her and she doesn't care.... Which really sums up my experience today. She was reported, but my guess is... It was forgotten the moment it was said.",1
Public Services & Government,"Las Vegas is my home airport, and I've flown out of the D gates countless times. The other night I was flying out after midnight, and their TSA Pre-Check lanes were closed. Bummer, but luckily they let me keep my shoes on with their ""half"" Pre-Check. There wasn't much of a line so I got through quick. Amazed at this airport's quickness with how much traffic they have!",4
Public Services & Government,For a busy airport and in comparison with other airports of this size the experience was very pleasant. Convenient with friendly staff and nit too long of a wait. With some of the miserable tsa I have been through this was actually very good. Thank you.,4
Public Services & Government,"Only one experience going through here, but as far as TSA checkpoints go, I'll actually give it 4 stars?!!?!?  The lines were short, and multiple TSA Agents were actually smiling, friendly and having conversations with travelers.  Going through security, it doesn't get much better than that...",4
Public Services & Government,"I love our little airport. Getting through security has always been a breeze (I've waited maybe 10 minutes during the holidays, but that's the absolute longest), the staff is always friendly, and on this occasion they were really showing their customer service skills by sending an agent down the line to see if anyone had TSA pre-check to get the line moving even faster. The guy actually seemed stressed out that we were going to wait five minutes before getting to the front. To solve the ""problem"" they opened up another line so that more IDs were getting checked at the same time. Never change, Madison TSA.",5
Public Services & Government,No precheck on Friday late morning.  Stupid.  We precheck fliers paid fees to be part of the program. You should have a line open for us middle day on a Friday.,1
Public Services & Government,"TSA pre check here only gets you the opportunity to stand in a slightly shorter line, and leave your shoes on.  Liquids out, laptops out.  Doesn't save time but it's usually not busy here.  That gets two stars.",2
Public Services & Government,"I find it hilarious that I'm reviewing an TSA checkpoint, because it's like ""What choice do you have?"" But I've been to several airports in my day and this was by far the slowest and most unorganized operation I've passed through.

The layout is narrow, making it very difficult for getting through in a wheelchair. Most of the agents were friendly enough, but the one at the end that tells you to keep it moving, was particularly curt and annoying.

I'm leaving this feedback in hopes that the airport team will make changes for the better in the near future. Other than the slow security checkpoint, the terminal was decent, with plenty of meal options and shops.

I'm sure I'll be through again, but maybe I'll fly a different airline to avoid this terminal!",2
Public Services & Government,"I typically only fly Alaska unless I absolutely have to travel by another airline so every time I'm in Phoenix I use this security check. Usually the longest lines I encounter are the ones that my team creates, so I don't mind it too much. Often times though it's been a breeze walking right through security. The people who check your boarding pass are friendly enough and the line agent don't typically have to say much. Today was different though. There are tons of people flying home from the national college football championship. I've never seen 4 lines open at a time here, but it's nice they did have them open. Passing through was a breeze. There was hardly any signage though and people didn't really realize there were multiple lines open. As I'm standing in line, instead of directing people, one tsa agent says loudly ""everyone's coming down this lane cause there's only one sign saying this lane is open. I agree the open lanes should be marked, but how about instead of standing there you open your mouth to help people through an unfamiliar airport for some?",3
Public Services & Government,"I usually do not have any problems with this organization. I always have my ID and boarding pass ready. I never wear belts or ball caps and am quickly in line to keep things moving. This morning at TSA in Phoenix I had to worst customer experience with this organization. I could  not believe how rude they were. There was a person by the name of Jesse that was on a very obvious power trip. Unfortunately his only job was to verify boarding passes and IDs. It is discouraging that he took it upon himself to pass on his negativity to the very people that fund his livelihood. He is certainly not ""in his element.""  To make matters worse TSA insisted that my bag had to be opened by an agent. My simple backpack has 2 compartments. It took the agent about fifteen minutes to find the pair of tweezers she was ultimately looking for. I politely offered to help her as I could see that opening a zipper was a seriously challenging task for her. She told me that I was not allowed to do this. Maybe next time they could have a sitting area for patrons while these seemingly important officers save our skies?",1
Public Services & Government,"AHEM.... F#$k TSA... FIRST THEY SAY MY PURSE IS A WEAPON REPLICA... and won't let me through unless I ""throw away my bag, leave the security area and check my  purse in my luggage, leave the security area and mail my bag."" I'm like first of all Phoenix is the only airport I've ever had a problem at ... not at NYC or Chicago, or Minneapolis, or Kansas  City, or Wichita, or Seattle, or Los Angeles, or Seattle. It's a purse, packed in a dust cover, inside a box, inside my luggage. Second don't treat me like I am a criminal and surround me and swab my hands for explosives... Do you see this manicure I cant open my cell phone port much less build a bomb... you have royally ticked me off and I still haven't tried to punch you in the face. Thirdly the rest of the staff took issue with your having issue... to the point they took me to the side and said you missus old ashy dark n ugly and you mr powertrip receding hairline were both a twat and jerk and to request a manager, that they would allow it but wasn't up to them... n  Fourth when is the last time you saw a weapon attached  to a purse with matching shoes and a belt??? Fifth do not try to hold me up in security on my way back from the ticket counter after checking said fabulous purse, oh now my laptop is explosive??? I wish it was so I could wipe your dumbness from America and prevent your DNA from reproducing...  Don't be assanign. #longliveAlexanderMcQueen #geturlife #tsapowertrip #thatshadeofgreenmakesyoulookugly",1
Public Services & Government,Pre check here is a joke. My wife flys often and the pre check is closed most of the time. Why go through the process and pay for it if it is never open?,1
Public Services & Government,"Precheck is always closed. I have flown through C gates 25-30 times in the last year and haven't been able to use precheck once. One time I complained and they said precheck at D gate was open so I walked down there. D gate wasn't any better, Precheck was closed and it had a longer line than C gate did. 

On a positive note, the pat downs are slightly more invasive at C gate than D gate.",1
Public Services & Government,"Only because I can't choose zero stars. What about having medication that can't go through the x-Ray machine causes me to require a full invasive pat down. I'm not sure. But what I am sure of is that the TSA had not done is a damn bit of good and is contrary to all of our American values. In conclusion, F You TSA. I hope you're proud of yourselves.",1
Public Services & Government,"I'm always TSA pre-check.  

This is my favorite security checkpoint because the lines here are always shorter than those at Terminal A.

The main thing is to realize that the TSA precheck line is on the far right.",4
Public Services & Government,"Whole new low this morning. Insulting passengers and making them cry for misunderstanding them. Maybe next time the agent could be clear as to whom he's speaking to and be kind with his words and actions. Looks like TSA needs courses on general respect and kindness.

Did I mention that this was through the TSA PreCheck line? Well, it definitely was.",1
Public Services & Government,"Oh the TSA Checkpoint...I often wonder how one ends up with this job; possibly some type of DMV referral process?  Pretty much a thankless job, and one that does not have a lot of great customer interactions.  

This one does get an 'A-OK' rating from me this time.  Traveling out of Phoenix to go back home.  The line was short, and the TSA Agents were actually friendly and a little chatty with us.  Maybe we caught them on an off day.  Either way this was a quick and painless process.",3
Public Services & Government,"Really disappointed, I know there are security procedures for a reason but when someone is wrong they should not be defensive and just admit to error. 
Coming in from Mexico I purchased 2 bottles of 3.4 ounces of vanilla not knowing I would be going thru TSA security again for my connecting flight home. I was told this was over the 3 oz limit and not able to go thru in my carry on. In my husbands bag there was an 8oz bottle of sunscreen, that passed security  just fine. When I questioned why his 8 oz bottle went thru just fine but my 3.4 was not both the TSA officer and the supervisor told me it was up to the agents discretion of what can pass and what can't. So then what's the point of having all these rules and regulations if it comes down to whomever lets whatever pass. An 8oz bottle of sunscreen vs 3.4 bottle of Mexican vanilla . Really !?!?! It feels like all this security is just a power struggle between officers and passengers instead of actually having a purpose of safety. 
BTW ..when I asked the original TSA agent about the option to check my bag she said it was a cost of $25, when the supervisor was talking to me he said a lot of times the airlines don't charge because they need the cabin space, however because I had already given up my item I could no longer get it back..so ya thanks for trying to make your wrong a right...but not really",1
Public Services & Government,"Biggest waste of money ever!  The TSA Pre-check line is officially the first time traveler, stroller. Wheelchair, family, and employee lane!  So frustrating to pay for a service and it is overtaken by I experienced travelers. Thanks for nothing TSA !!",1
Public Services & Government,"So, I have PreCheck, and I have an artificial hip.  I actually, stupidly, thought that PreCheck would actually get through TSA faster. Nope.  So in Phoenix, the PreCheck line has the metal detector, which means I have to wait to be wanded. So I normally tell them about my hip in the PreCheck line, so they send me over to another line with the body scanners, and my carry-on stays in the first line, but of course in those other lines you have to take off your shoes, coat, etc.  So I have to constantly tell them I'm PreCheck even if everyone else in line isn't, and of course they look at me like I'm an idiot. Why are you in this line if your PreCheck?

I guess nobody at TSA ever realized that MAYBE someone with PreCheck may actually have an artificial joint. I guess nobody ever figured that out.

Maybe TSA needs to all get together at a meeting, and figure out an organized way to handle EVERY type of passenger they might have. Then make sure EVERY TSA person knows this procedure.",2
Public Services & Government,"I really appreciate TSA for stealing my personal items out of my checked bags and then leaving a note inside telling me that my bag was searched. Probably the dumbest criminals ever. I hope you enjoy my Bose speaker. At least you stole the charger too, so that proves you're not totally retarded. 

""Protecting you and your fellow passengers"" -TSA",1
Public Services & Government,"I'm so frustrated with TSA Checkpoint at Sky Harbor. Terminal 4-A checkpoint is a huge checkpoint which, on Sunday, is pretty much at max capacity all day. Business travelers like me travel out on Sunday and back on Thursday or Friday and depend on TSA Precheck to get me through security quickly.

You offer PreCheck services and take payments at your airport. Then you have PreCheck locations at your security screening areas, but you decide to CLOSE them around 5pm for who knows what reason! Why would you deny that service, THAT WE PAY FOR, on a busy commuter travel day!? The past 2 weeks when I've approached T4-A I've seen no less than 200 people queued up in the regular line and at least HALF of those people when asked have TSA Pre on their boarding pass. Are you trying to save some money by not staffing that location? Well I'd didn't get a discount when I paid into this service.

Do everyone a favor. Staff this checkpoint just like you do T4-B and help out the people to weekly keep this airport's lights on and everyone employed. We don't have a choice of another airport to fly American out of. You've got us by the b*lls. Please do the right thing and allow us to use the services we paid for.",1
Public Services & Government,"They are mean, rude, and DO NOT COMMUNICATE WELL.They all need to be retrained or get another job. Everyone is not wired to work with the public. It's clear Phoenix hired a bunch of TSA employees with no customer skills. That was my experience before noon on Monday,10/26/15. I can only imagine how bad it gets throughout the day.",1
Public Services & Government,They are severely understaffed. Got to the airport 2 hrs early and waited an hour to get through. People were nice but it was ridiculous to wait that long. This system needs to be corrected.,1
Public Services & Government,"User be ware, they change the rules and do what they want. They couldn't follow their own rule book let along be capable of reading it. And for us PreCheck paying fools, they close the D gates early as well then won't recognize your PreCheck status unless you have a printed boarding pass so they say.As far as I'm concerned they are just another waste of tax payer/ the flying publics money. The funny thing is when I fly out of McCarron their PreCheck line is always open and I can get from car to gate in less than 15 minutes, Phoenix employees need to go and learn from a real busy airport how it works and how to treat PreChecked Americans!",1
Public Services & Government,They are the rudest  undertrained idiots I have ever had a experience with ever. If this state is based on tourism they have a sad future. I will never come back.,1
Public Services & Government,"Dear Phoenix Sky Harbor TSA,

What a day. 

Unlike a lot of folks I encountered today, I'm a reasonable, calm lady. 

I'm not prone to lashing out or threatening harm upon a poor Southwest Customer Service Agent because God forbid the weather couldn't get me to my destination on time. 

Not being able to leave for Denver (I was scheduled to leave on SWA#1295, but cancelled at my client's request after several delays and him being unable to get on the road) because of the blizzard wasn't your fault. 

But I wanted to personally thank you for chipping a large part of the front of my night guard used for TMJ today (11/17). 

I rely on it to keep severe TMJ headaches and jaw pain at bay. 

One time my TMJ got so bad, it damn near completely locked my jaw and had to be prescribed heavy duty muscle relaxants just so 1) It could open and 2) So my dentist could see the damage.

This was a $300 dental appliance I've had for two years and had to pay 100% out of pocket because my insurance doesn't cover it.

In the future: When inspecting dental appliances in a passenger's bag, please handle with care. Night guards, retainers, etc. are NOT cheap to replace and aren't always covered by insurance. 

Seriously, break our make-up compacts all day. Just not the night guards!

Let's hope my dentist can help me with this. 

Signed, 

Nighttime Jaw Clencher Lady who's about to be in a LOT of pain. :'(",1
Public Services & Government,"The TSA employees in this section are lazy and unfriendly. On the day before thanksgiving, one of the busiest traveling days of the year, the employees did not perform their duties properly or effectively. The line for TSA pre-check was closed even though it took over 30 mins to effectively move through the regular lines. The employees behaved lazily while also being unfriendly and choosing to hold conversations rather than conduct their paid duties. They held up many passengers because of their own arrogance rather than any creditable intelligence. I missed my my flight because of the mismanagement of this organization. No matter what time frame, I suggest not to rely on anything the TSA propaganda states",1
Public Services & Government,"I was at Phoenix Sky harbor airport. Took 45 min to check in, another 45 min to wait in line for X-ray. After X-ray, this a hole took my kids 1 foot long plastic hockey sticks that I bought for them. He said they were dangerous. We were at a game in Phoenix New Years Eve, so much fun, until TSA...",1
Public Services & Government,"One of the worst run TSA checkpoints I've ever seen, and I've flown out of a ton of airports, and ones much smaller than PHX.

I was flying out of B, but the B gates security were closed. Nevermind that I had just walked down there from a restaurant in the middle.

I arrived to the A gates to a total nightmare scenario. TSA Precheck was closed, as they like to do here. I was lucky enough to be in first class for my flight, so I used that lane. There were a bunch of people in that line, so I asked if I was in the right place. The girl in front of me said a TSA agent just came through and ambiguously said this lane or the next one was for Precheck. What followed was a free-for-all with people using the disabled/employee lane and the first class lane. 

I called for a TSA agent to come over and explain which line was which, but they just looked me in the eye and listened to my explanation of how everyone was confused and nobody knew which line was with. Nobody from TSA was willing to come over and take control of the situation. They were just letting everyone in in whatever order they fought their way to the front.

I ended up getting yelled at and threatened by another passenger who mistook me as the enemy. I was just trying to get TSA to, you know, do their job. I'm the good guy here, sticking up for the 90% of the line that was getting cut by more aggressive passengers. 

Anyway, 15 minutes later I made it through security. Chatted with a supervisor who more or less admitted it was a terribly run checkpoint. Apparently this is normal in PHX, as an airport employee ensured me I was right, and the lounge agents shared their experiences with this TSA checkpoint.

It's really too bad this review will make absolutely no difference, just as me talking to a supervisor or filing a formal TSA complaint will. TSA will continue to do their absolute minimum to complete their job tasks without any pride for their work.",1
Public Services & Government,Wow! So the folks who run TSA think the best think to do is shut down TSAPre because they do not have enough staff. Tell me what the hell about that makes sense. Hey let's shut down the line that moves people through the fastest. I would honestly rather take my chances with the old system. TSA is incompetent and has no idea what they are doing.,1
Public Services & Government,"Rude TSA agent at the checkpoint where they check ID and boarding passes. No one was at the checkpoint and the TSA agent was sitting alone at his stand. He made my wife go back to the sign that said ""Wait for next available agent"" and told here to wait until he told her to walk up to him. He then went on to lecture her about following directions. It was completely unnecessary, rude and condescending. I've been a supporter of the TSA until this point. Now I understand why people complain about their demeanor and Congress is critical of their performance.",1
Public Services & Government,"I've been to a lot of airports and never write reviews but I felt I needed to this time. The security line was long and because they didn't have their TSA pre check line open there wasn't even an expedited line for TSA. The lady at the scanner was the rudest I've ever experienced and made snide remarks to me when I didn't even say anything to her. Not sure how these people are evaluated on a regular basis but apparently they aren't measured on customer service. Understand it's not meant to be a ""friendly"" job but they can at least be civil.",1
Public Services & Government,Terribly badly organized - closing security stations at will with no rhyme or reason making people endlessly wander around Phoenix airport. Your chances to miss your plane because of immensely long lines at TSA: immensely high! Best option: try not to go through Phoenix airport.,1
Public Services & Government,"Friendly TSA agents! Always helpful when in a hurry. I travel a lot for work, and I feel like this are the most helpful. They normal don't have long lines",4
Public Services & Government,"What a joke. The line is out the door. 5 guys standing around, and we are forced to pay for this... if I ran my business like this, my doors would be closed in a week.",1
Public Services & Government,Worst security checkpoint yet. Almost missed my plane because of a full un warranted body search.,1
Public Services & Government,they could not pass my coke bottle its so small 10 oz that the smallest.... sighs... they should increase oz on pop drinks like 10 oz or something...,3
Public Services & Government,TSA PRE-Check lane closed  frequently. Disappointing for a major airport. Be prepared to keep shoes on take laptop out.,3
Public Services & Government,Once again flying out of terminal 3 and precheck is closed. Glad I paid money for a service I can't use. Why do you have precheck if you can't use precheck? You go through the line everyone else except you get to keep your shoes on. I feel safer already.,1

Local Flavor,"I was excited to see Tempe hosting this event, Scottsdale and Phoenix have theirs but they lack the personality potential of a Tempe event.  Needless to say, I was terribly disappointed in their first time showing.

To start, parking was an absolute nightmare because of one hired guy who kept holding up all cars onto rio salado parkway at the hardy light.  Several people complained about him and he was eventually replaced, but people were sitting in their cars just to get into the lot for over 20 minutes.

Once inside, it was chaos again.  There was no clear lines for will call, purchasing, or already had tickets.  And then, they actually ran out of the wristbands for the event, which is important because you were only given 8 tastes of alcohol and the ticket was on your wristband.  By the way, I never saw on the site that your drinks would be limited.  8 tastes is enough, but transparency is always best.

Water was scarce.  I was more than wiling to actually buy a bottle of water, but no one was selling, and it was hot!  Finally, they brought in free bottles and dumped them in a plastic tub with some ice.  

The food was great and there was plenty of options, but the lines were way to long, and tempers were flaring.  Did they underestimate how many would attend or just space the tents poorly?  Additionally, several food vendors ran out of food by 2:45!  I paid 60.00 and would have liked to actually get my money's worth. 

Anyway, I could go on, but I think I've clearly made my opinion that this event was not very good.  If they host another, I hope they plan better.  Everyone I spoke to was pretty disappointed.",1
Local Flavor,"Granted, this was the first annual....but if this becomes an annual event....they have ALOT to work on for improvements. 

Like the first reviewer said, the will call/pre-purchased/purchase on site was a complete debacle. we bought tickets on-line but had to wait for about 15 minutes at will-call then were told to go stand in another line for 10 minutes....disorganized!

luckily we got in just before 1pm and good thing we did. by 2pm, the lines for the food  and drinks were horrendously long. speaking of the drinks....what a complete and utter cluster....we got 8 pours included on our tickets. and they were the absolute measliest, tiniest, weakest pours i have ever had. i mean SIPS! each time i got a pour, i just couldn't believe how sad the pours were. i wasn't the only one...i overheard many, many people complain about how lame the pours were. at Devoured, for 75 bucks, you get all the alcohol you can possibly drink....and you don't have to wait in line for 15 minutes per drink!

now the food.....albeit i'm sure it sufficed for most people, we were under the impression that there would be more options for non-meat eaters....wrong again. this event is great if you love pork. with the unoriginal presentations of numerous pork tacos or sliders....well then, i guess the creative talents of tempe's restaurants have much to be desired if all they can come up with is several versions of pork sliders or pork tacos. but if you don't eat meat....well, you can get your fill of hummus. and poor mellow mushroom ""we'll have more pizza in 5 minutes"", ""we'll have more pizza in 10 minutes""....

truly beautiful venue and all the radio stations hosting were fun. the weather was perfect and the atmosphere was great at first....until people started to realize that by standing in one too many lines for that long, there was no way they were getting their money's worth of 50 bucks. 

lot to work on Tempe....",1
Local Flavor,"I concur with everyone else...

I understand that this is the first year of this event so I wasn't expecting things to run 100% perfect. But it was pretty bad start to finish.

Parking, indeed was a nightmare. After 
waiting in line forever to get into the lot, we finally bailed and turned around and parked at the lot by Tempe Town Lake about 1/2 mile away, and just walked to the arts center.

We finally get to the arts center and see a huge line.  My sister still needed to buy a ticket but we didn't know where to go. Random people passing out wristbands, people just standing around not knowing where to go. It was total chaos.

Once we get into the event, you have to wait in line after line forever. In the 3 hours we were there, I only got to try a fish taco from Rubios, a small square of pizza from Mellow mushroom, which took extra long because they had run out of pizza. Tomato soup from Lodge but they ran out of the grilled cheese that was supposed to accompany it. 

Drinks I only had a sample of (not so great) wine and a beer (they were pretty stingy with the beer pour and my husband made a comment about that). There were a lot of options at the event, but the length of the lines combined with the short event time, made it virtually impossible to try even a fraction of what was there. I didn't even get to see any of the demonstrations or entertainment because 99% of my time was spent in line. No way in hell you are getting your money's worth.

It was particularly hot today and there was no water to be found anywhere. It's not really foreseeable that it would be close to 80 degrees in Feb, but you do have people drinking alcohol  in the sun all afternoon. Water should have been readily available.

I don't get how this event was so poorly executed? It's a ticketed event so they knew exactly how many people would be in attendance.",1
Local Flavor,"Really, really, really wanted to ask for a refund and I think people deserve one!. This event was just unacceptable at almost every level. Like other reviewers have expressed, it was greatly disorganized, the whole set up was a nightmare, unbelievably long lines, general foot traffic had to walk through the lines people were waiting in and on three different occasions when we finally got up to the booth or close, the food would be sold out, this happened by 2:30pm and the event was from 1-4pm. When we did get food, it was a very small portion, we actually waited in line for a slice of cucumber with a spoonful of hummus on it (I'm not kidding!) I did see some people with ribs and cole slaw that looked really good but the line for it was just laughable. Ok, on to the wines...omg, breaking the bank here with Beringer, Rex-Goliath, and a couple of other low end grocery store picks. For $60 (the price of entry pre-sale) we could have gone to BevMo and bought a bottle of Justin Isosceles. There's not a lot I can say that was good about this event except that the weather was nice but as someone else pointed out it did get warm and very few areas with tables or shade. Super insulting and disappointing that they charged this much for this event.",1
Local Flavor,"I understand that with a first year event there are always kinks to work out.  I certainly don't expect everything to run smoothly.  But REALLY!?!?!  This event was a disaster from start to finish.  

The parking was ridiculous.  Attendees were directed to a dirt lot but if you were approaching from the west (as we were), getting into the lot was via green yield.  Which meant that things backed up.  At some point, we turned around and approached from the other direction which was slightly better.  While waiting in the hellish line, one person went on ahead (on foot) to grab the will-call tickets.  

Eventually, we gave up and parked on 1st street.  Wish we'd done this from the beginning as there was tons of space and it was just a short walk.  

In general, I avoid will-call because it's just one more line to stand in.  But, this event gave us no other option.  The will call lines were crazy long and I was thankful that we had the foresight to send someone ahead.  

Upon getting our bracelets, we learned that there is a limit on alcohol samples - we had eight tickets with our bracelets.  This was never disclosed pre-event.  Unlimited should mean unlimited.  

The lines for samples were ridiculously long.  To add insult to injury, some of the samples were just downright sad.  And waiting in a very long line for two swallows of wine is just not my idea of a good time.  

We happened to note that one restaurant (I forget which one) literally brought a small Weber grill.  Did the organizers not give the restaurants a heads-up on expected attendance or were these guys strangely optimistic? We'll never know.  

When all was said and done, the part that bothered us most of all was that we really didn't feel like we got the value out of our tickets.  If we'd each gone to a restaurant and spent $60, we would have had a really nice meal, a cocktail or two and not been cooking for two hours in the Arizona sun.

The event itself was only three hours long and if you ""wasted"" any event time on signing up for one of many giveaways, watching the band or the cooking demonstrations, or going to the bathroom, that's time you're not standing in line for the next morsel of food.  

The Taste in Tempe is literally just that...  a taste.",1
Local Flavor,"Unorganized and had a lack of details before the event, like how many drinks you get.",1
Local Flavor,"to say it was mediocre is being generous. 
lines were too long. pours were too short. 
the best food there was venesias pizza and the pie hole had yummy pies.
the band was great.  could be good needs some work.",1
Local Flavor,"Does Montreal have the best FUCing Yelp Elite community in the universe? I think so.

Tout a commencé par le bel accueil de notre CM Risa, avec des cocktails à l'Apérol et au Campari (merci aux commanditaires!). Cela tombait bien, car j'adore le Campari, cet alcool italien amer. Mélanie la barmaid est sympathique et tout était rafraîchissant. 

Les Yelpers ont bavardé un peu en présentant leur objet (genre d'activité  show and tell) Ont suivi de délicieuses bouchées, gracieuseté de TNC: une porchetta maison, des crevettes de Matane sur croustilles de maïs, une salade d'orzo et la finale, un tartare de coeur de canard! Le tartare était très intéressant, mêlant les textures tendre--croustillant. Le dessert était spectaculaire: gâteau à la mélasse et meringue, croustillant et orange à la manière de Pollock: une performance live à manger sur le comptoir! Très créatif! Le chef et son équipe était en feu! 

Merci à TNC pour tout, merci Risa d'organiser de si beaux événements gourmands!",5
Local Flavor,"Awesome evening !

I really loved how friendly and entertaining the staff was and the dessert totally rocked! Thank you T&C and Yelp for the invite !",5
Local Flavor,"What a fantastic event!  This time around Elites were invited to Tripes and Caviar in Verdun to sample their food along with some delicious cocktails.  Not being too familiar with Verdun it was a welcome opportunity to discover what the neighbourhood has to offer.

The night started off with a sampling from Tripes and Caviar's menu which included such foods as duck heart tartar, shrimp salad, pig head porchetta and a creamy orzo salad.  I'll admit that I was a little apprehensive about trying duck heart tartar but I'm glad I did because it was seriously delicious.  To go with all this fine food we had Aperol and Campari drinks which were strong and a great addition to the night.

The highlight of the event was definitely the dessert.  The restaurant staff did this presentation which was a tribute to the painter Jackson Pollock.  Complete with music they created this artsy presentation on the bar area.  It was completely unexpected and completely awesome.  The dessert itself, a molasses cake, was divine.  It was oh so moist and delicious.

Thanks go to Risa for organizing a great event, Jean-Michel, the owner of Tripes and Caviar for hosting us and Aperol and Campari for sponsoring.  I really was impressed by the restaurant and definitely want to return to try it out.",5
Local Flavor,"As a first yelp event, it was pretty cool. The staff that catered to us was awesome and really down to earth. 
Risa is hilarious ! :)

I'm not going to lie though, last nights event isn't really my ""type"" of thing - but that's personal taste and doesn't take away from the fact that everything was really well executed and people were clearly enjoying themselves. Kudos!",4
Local Flavor,"As per the owner of Tripes & Caviar - Jean-Michel's word of the night - this event was, ""dangereux!"" So, what does that really mean...

Let's go through the night and see if this was true - in no particular order. Was he referring to the molasses cake, chocolate syrup and merengue that were slapped on to the bar top and floor before being torched in a candle lit spectacle? I'll call it, ""comptoir brulée!"" for good measure - very inventive a la ""Jackson Pollack"". 

Was it perhaps the glass cauldron of triple whammy punch with a large ladle and drunken oranges floating in it, or the light refreshing Aperol/Campari Spritzers?

Either way, the bites and nibbles helped balance out the liquid substances quite well.

Do you call 'Gaspar' farmed suckling pig head panchetta sous-vide(d) for 8 or 9 hours a taste hazard? Are curled salty Nordic shrimp and avocado 'melanged' served with tortilla triangles is risky? Was the orzo, mixed with feta and friend onion strings (probably thrown in to take us off the perilous trail? Must have been my favourite of the night...spicy chopped tartare of duck heart ('coeur' not 'liquor' as I thought I heard in the tumult). 

At one point a conversation about the Master Chef TV show broke out, and what's that judges name again? oh yeah...Graham Elliot. Just the kind of foodie convo Yelpers seem to like. 

Na, that's pretty safe, it must have been the cool and hot stickers being stuck!

All ended safely (or at least when I left), so a merci bien to all whom organized, performed and participated in the unique private soirée. 

It was truly dangerous...I mean delicious.",5
Local Flavor,"Let me just say this right now... BEST EVENT EVER! 

I had such a great time, everyone was so friendly, the staff was prepared while still being spontaneous. They really know how to show a girl a good time! Seriously!

The stories everyone told were fabulously interesting and even my normally aloof son was intrigued enough to join in conversations. 

The food was amazing without being ridiculous. There was a purpose to the madness and that really blew me away. Sometimes avant-garde goes too far off-grid and Tripes et Caviar are right there, in the perfect spot, teetering on the edge of insanity, duck heart tartar, but maintaining their balance with an orzo salad, and shrimp nordique. The pigs head porchetta was probably my favorite savoury dish of the evening.

But then they pulled off that dessert. I was bursting with joy. I swear to you, that was so exciting I could hardly contain my glee in watching the team construct their Jackson Pollock tribute dessert. It reminded me of what David Garibaldi and His CMYK's do (only they use dance and paint). 

So now, days later, I've finally calmed down enough to write this review, but even as I do I find myself jumping up and down!

Risa, this was a amazing, and you, you are amazing! Thanks for letting me be a part of it!",5
Local Flavor,"OMG! We had a Jackson Pollock special dessert!!! We had the Pollock :D

I saw this dessert on Youtube almost a year ago, during a creative conference downtown, and I knew I had to try this. It's a once-in-a-lifetime foodie event that anyone must try once!

I'm already a big fan of Tripes & Caviar, and this Yelp event was a 'must go': delicious food, sympathetic people, and just an amazing service from the T&C Castle crew.

The drinks were not my favorites (I'm not a particular fan of bitter drinks), but overall, it was a pretty cool night. Risa did it again, organizing a nice Yelp event. Thanks Risa!",5
Local Flavor,"Un autre super événement signé Risa D ! Quoique déjà une fan finie du T&C Castle, je dois avouer que le mariage Yelp + Tripes&Caviar s'est fait à merveille. Bonnes bouchées, bons cocktails et beau monde. J'ai surtout aimé le jeu de la soirée... toutes ces histoires comiques et uniques qui nous en on fait apprendre davantage sur la belle gang de Yelpeurs. 
Merci encore pour l'invitation !",5
Public Services & Government,"I will mirror what the other reviewer stated.  Needing to do my notary oath (the final hoop before I could start stamping!), I visited their office on a June Tuesday around 11:00 am and was in and out in no time.  Everyone that I encountered in the building, from the security guard in the foyer, to the office workers at the Register of Deeds was friendly, helpful and polite.  Miss Valerie (what her coworker called her) was the one that took care of me and I was $10 lighter, sworn, certificated and out the door in no time.  

I parked in the parking deck off of Davidson between 3rd and 4th, which proved to be not terribly expensive ($1 for 30-45 minutes, I think) and not too far of a hike, only crossing one substantial intersection.",5
Public Services & Government,"All of the prior reviews were accurate.  Very pleasant employees.   Clean, neat and professional atmosphere.    When I went (Friday at 9:15) it was not busy.   The employee took a total of about 15 minutes.  Parking is not easy but everything else was.",5
Public Services & Government,"I came here after the unsatisfactory service received from the security guard at the Tatum office. The guard here was respectable as expected and for it being the busiest office in all of Phoenix, it was surprisingly a quick in and out. About 45 minutes. I got there around 10am. Of course I was just requesting a replacement card. 

The only downfall is there is not nearly enough parking for how busy this office is. So be prepared for that.",4
Public Services & Government,"Comfortable brand new building, safe and clean.  Smells brand new and fast service.   Staff speak multiple languages and the elevators were super fast!",5
Public Services & Government,It was an ok experience. Arrived just before it opened and had to wait in line around the building but after arriving inside and getting my numberI had atleast an hour wait. I was getting my replacement card..,3
Public Services & Government,"Truly wasn't an awful experience. I've been dreading the idea of getting a new social card since I moved and lost my old one. Woke up early and went to the Mesa location just to find out they don't issue applications for social security card renewals so I drove down to Phoenix where they told me to go. The parking lot was filled and kinda hard to find a parking spot. The security guard was actually pretty pleasant, very nice and friendly man. The waiting room was just about full which obviously ruins your mood a little but I was maybe there an hour before my number got called. The lady who did the application was really nice and patient and I was out of the in no time. Pretty pleased with my experience here. I see a lot of bad reviews on Google and other locations of the social security offices so I thought I'd share mine not great, but not so bad experience.",4
Public Services & Government,"eh,   it is what it is..BUSY! long waits",3
Public Services & Government,"This place is gross. I was there so long was forced to use restroom, yuck. Security grills you up front. I did give 2 stars because at least after 2 hours the lady that helped me was pleasant enough. Glad I don't need to come often lol",2

Restaurants,"Terrible greasy burger, almost burnt fries, and slow cashier who let her airport employee friend cut the line.  I watched the grill guy put raw hamburger and raw chicken on the grill and then turn around with the same hand and finish making a sandwich, touching all the toppings and bun.  My meal ended up in the trash.  Skip this one.",1
Restaurants,"Let me first start off by defending against some of the reviews of my fellow Yelpers. If you are looking for a bargain, this isn't the place for you. If you are looking for a speedy turnaround, again, not the place for you. This joint cooks real hamburgers from scratch. Good luck finding something this fresh throughout any airport. I eat here any chance I get. When you order your burger you are told that it will take about 10 minutes to cook. Again, nothing is pre-cooked. That hamburger patty he is putting on the grill is the real deal. A full meal including fries and a drink will average you $15 and it's worth every cent. Yes, it's greasy and heavy, but it's a ""real"" burger. I feel I'm a very manly dude and can appreciate those characteristics in my hamburger. Seating kinda sucks, but perhaps it's so passers by can gawk at that look of pure satisfaction on my face as I lick my fingers clean. Delish.

If you don't like costly slow burgers, there a McDonald's around the corner with factory burgers.",5
Restaurants,"One of the worst blt sandwiches I've had in my life. And that cost me $10! 

The person behind the counter was super rude. It wasn't clear that the full menu wasn't available in the morning and made that clear pretty rudely. When I asked what was available, he stared me down as if that was a stupid question. The lady in queue behind told me that the screen was going through the menus one by one and that that breakfast menu would show up soon.",1
Restaurants,Horrible service. Did not even try it. I went in and pointed to a strange looking hotdog while asking the employee what it was. He bluntly replied with a horrible attitude that it was just a hotdog. Asked him what it had on it and pointed at the sign instead of describing it to me face to face as if he was begging to be replaced with a vending machine. If I wanted to read I would read it or gone to an automated restaurant.,1
Local Flavor,"July 19th, 2014 - Tempe Center for the Arts

This was the inaugural Real, Wild and Woody Beer Festival, organized by the Arizona Craft Brewers Guild and held at the Tempe Center for the Arts.

This amazing event showcased some of Arizona's finest craft brewers who offered a vast array of specialty cask and barrel-aged beers, as well as some wild beers, representing the progressive brewing scene that is alive and thriving in Arizona.  Many of the special offerings available at this event were made exclusively for this special event.  

Beer festivals in Arizona, in the middle of summer...might not sound appealing given the often 100 degree-plus temperatures this time of the year.  The Real, Wild and Woody event was held inside the cool, air conditioned confines of the Tempe Center for the Arts, setting the event apart from other local festivals such as the Strong Beer Festival held during Arizona Beer Week in February.

This event definitely has the potential to be the premier craft beer festival in the greater Phoenix/Tempe area.  I would highly recommend it to any craft beer lover!

Great job to Rob Fulmer and the Arizona Craft Brewers Guild!",4
Local Flavor,"Very, very good event for their first year.  The line to get in was a little long and it was a bit crowded inside.

The most important thing here is that the beer was great!  OMG not only were all the AZ breweries here they all came with outstanding creations.  Lots of interesting ingredients and barrel-aged goodness.

The Perch's rosemary IPA and Firestone Walker Stickee Monkee were my favorites.

I'll definitely be at this event again next year!",4
Local Flavor,"Let's get right to it and talk about the brews.  Upon entry you received a set of 20 coupons, each of which could be redeemed for a 4oz sample at any of the vendors. I am not a mathematician, but that means if you use all of your coupons, you're drinking 80oz of beer. To put that in perspective, imagine having two 40's duct-taped to your hands, and finishing both of those.  A lot of people pass out in my yard before completing such a task. That's a lot of beer!

So there were a lot of different kinds of beer, and a lot of different brewers - some local, and some from as far as Philly (and maybe further, who knows?). The first beer I had was a 'sour' beer, which lived up to its name.  It tasted like I'd thrown up in my own mouth the morning after a wild bender that involved consuming most of an amish barn. Things went uphill from there though, with each beer I consumed tasting progressively better and better. By the end of the event, I don't eve know where some of the beers I was drinking were coming from!

That's the good - what about the bad?  So first off, they advertised that small bites would be available, which is great because it helps you cleanse your palette, and makes you not hungry.  Unfortunately there was very little food here - I ended up eating a piece of garlic bread, and some ice cream. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but that's not enough to cleanse the palette between 20 different beers, and by the time I left, I was definitely hungry.

The other bad thing, the men's bathroom couldn't withstand the onslaught of beer consumers.  There was about an inch of 'water' on the floor of the bathroom after 3 hours into the event, and just between you guys and me, I don't think the 'water' was all H2O, if you get what I'm saying. Come on - it's a beer festival - be prepared for this kind of thing.

Overall it was a good time, and the price was pretty fair, but take care of the bathroom situation, and give us some food.",3
Restaurants,"The food court where this place is located is bimming with good food options and it will hard to choose from all the choices avaiable.

But if you choose this out of the bunch yoou will def be treated to some good food with huge qty. I order a chicken schwarma plate whixh came with rice, potaties,hummus,garlic cream and salad.

The food was def freshly made as evident by the taste since it was different from other stuff and really good. The chicken was not as moist but not as dry either so right there. 

The price of that was around 11 canadian dollars so right there with US prices except good qty and good quality. Def best middle eastern food at a food court i have had",4
Restaurants,"I'd give this a 4.5.  The food...the food!  Delicious shwarma, salad, rice and more.  I was here in 2012 and it was great then, too.  So, consistency over the years.  Great food, large portions, good prices, nice people...GO!!",4
Restaurants,"Don't let looks fool you. It looks cheaper than a fast food, but the food is delicious. We tried the vegetarian baba. It had three kind of salad, eggplant, pita, something with sweet peas, humus, and some more. And everything tasted great!",5
Arts & Entertainment,Recently went to this haunted house and was truly disappointed. We bought our tickets at the door which were $30 each and paid $5 for parking. Once we got past security we went into the tent and saw the line which was 300+ people long. We waited in line for one and a half hours and only saw 3 characters. Once we past the first line we proceeded on to the second line which was to enter into the haunted house . Finally we get to go in (after another 30 min wait) and noticed that everyone was going in single file all together . We walked thru the houses in about 10 min and not once got frightened because everyone was walking in a single line and you knew what was coming next. Very poorly organized and not to mention they didn't have any fans so it was extremely hot. My advice would be to go to another haunted house save your money.A scary movie would be scarier than this haunted house.,1
Arts & Entertainment,"I was very disappointed with this attraction. The amount of people they sent through in groups was way more then they should have sent through. The actors were really not that scary. I paid $53 to be in and once in line it was lie we were all the same. I paid for VIP 2 but felt like general admission. I shouldn't have had to wait as I paid for instant access. I would not recommend this to anyone unless there was a decent Groupon for the tickets. Nice try Rob, maybe next year!!",1
Arts & Entertainment,This haunted house was cheaply put together and just a knock off of Rob Zombies movies. Sadly there wasn't very much originality and the tickets were overpriced for what it was. It was maybe a step up from a kiddie carnival haunted house at best.  My friends and I were baffled that Rob zombie could put his name on this,1
Arts & Entertainment,"First off I am a big fan of Rob Zombie and his movies but this was very disappointing.  I paid for the VIP tickets online and then found that we still had to pay for parking when we got there.  With the VIP tickets we skipped the initial line which was nice but in the first house (Lords of Salem) it was a long line of people walking through pitch black hallways and there was nobody in there to scare us.  

The second house was visually much more entertaining but still just a line of people walking through this 3D house and not much to be scared of.  

Again in the third we literally walked through in a line of people and didn't find much to scare us.  

I expected so much more form an attraction with Rob Zombies name attached to it.  I think they need to take a step back and rethink how they send people through.  For the money I spent it definitely was not worth it.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Pros:

Acting was awesome (most looked just like the characters in the film)
We got VIP 1, you get faster access and a free shirt (no other haunts give you shirts)
Scenery was amazing
The actors interact with you
You are not stuck in a huge continuing line while in the haunt
funny and scary at the same time
Actors interact with you instead of just being pop out scares
nice vibe all together
they let you in your own group (we only had 2) 

Cons:
Hard to find, we got lost three times trying to get there
$5 parking

Great experience all together, best haunt I have been too in a while. Definitely worth the VIP 1 . It wasn't too expensive either. Like i said, other haunts don't give you shirts with your ticket. I had a blast. I hope they come out again next year. Arrive when it opens to avoid getting in the continuing long line while in the haunt, if you end up in that....it is your own fault for going to late. 

working in a haunt for 8 years, when the middle mof the night is coming and the lines are insanely huge....you have to put more people in the groups because of the customers bitching about the wait time. it is the customers fault for the wait time, and if they are smashed into a huge group. it is out of the control of the haunt if everyone mashes together in the haunt. Blame the customers that walk like damn turtles. 

Anyway, Loved it and want to go back!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Ok so all this hype about this house was given to us in San Diego and me and my wife got all excited when we heard it was in Arizona this year. 

So we bought the VIP 2 to get in and avoid the lines like a normal haunted house does. But all they did was push up in front of the line take our wristbands and send us on our way. 

The first house was a major disappointment I had more fun scaring the teenage kids behind us than walking in the dark. The 2nd house was a visual entertainment but waiting 15 minutes to go into the third house was ridiculous. Why buy the VIP and wait. The third houses scariest part was the midget running through the the crowd screaming and scaring people. The effects were good and the actors did their best, but man the whole overall experience was pathetic. Like others I expected way more from rob zombie. We go to several haunted houses a year and this one was the worst, besides a t shirt but i could've ordered that from Amazon. Plus paying to park cmon advance notice would've been nice. 

The 13th floor and others are way more entertaining, heck even a wimpy church one would e better. My advice don't waste your money.",1
Arts & Entertainment,If I could give this zero stars I would I was completely disappointed it was not scary way overpriced will never do it again,1
Arts & Entertainment,"Went here tonight... First time in years going to a haunted house that wasn't in an amusement park.  Must say that I get a lot  more scared from the cart riding haunted houses found in amusement parks.

It just wasn't at all scary. I didn't even find a moment when I was scared or even caught off guard.  . & I did have an open mind and was pretty excited about it.

Only reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars is because they actually did a great job with their artistry.  It was more of an art/movie scene museum. A place where you can come and get an up close look at movie stages and the magnificent make-up. 

So save your money if you are looking to get scared. Come to this place if you want a look at movie make-up and technology.

Oh and make sure you pay the extra 11 or so bucks for VIP 1 over general admission. It's well worth not waiting in an obnoxiously long G.A. line. NO ONE was in VIP 2, that's just a waste of money. I would've been REaLLY upset if I had waited in the G.A. Line only to be so disappointed by the weak haunted house.

Bottom line - save ur $$$",2
Arts & Entertainment,This was the most disappointing haunted house I've ever been to.... The first house you just walk through the dark and was boring walking along feeling the walls to know which way to walk... The second house 3-D was awesome scenes but again no surprise or scare.... The third house had more potential for a scare... It was set up like a typical scare but the actors did not do a lot to scare.... The employees that cut the wrist band for the VIP 1 was rude and over all bossy and another employee that was telling you too get your glasses for the second house was just rude... There was no scare or thrill in the way they acted it just seemed like people on a power trip. I always try new haunted houses and this one was a major disappointment... We went with a group of 10 and at the very beginning they said we would have to spilt up into 2 smaller groups to get the full effect so we did but after the first 2 minutes of the first house we were running into other people so what was the point in splitting us up and messing up our night for nothing... And paying to park was ridiculous especially with no warning from the web site.... I enjoyed the fire hulla hoop show outside more than the whole tour.,1
Arts & Entertainment,"This place is awesome !!! It's lengthy so you get your money's worth the actors are very much into their rolls
Scared me like a lil girl!",5
Arts & Entertainment,Awful.  Horrible haunted house experience.  Expensive.  The actors didn't even try.  There even was a guy in the middle of the dark tunnel telling you how to get out safely.  There wasn't even the classic scary ending with a guy and a chain saw chasing you.  It was completely underwhelming.,1
Arts & Entertainment,"Went opening night and had VIP Tickets, according to the email we could be there at 5 and get in the Haunted Houses by 6pm. We got there at 4:30 and there was a line of people waiting against a fence, as we were standing there the crew started to set up to line dividers.. We asked them if there was a special place for the VIP people, they told us no. 2 hours later we see a huge line that leads to tents and I had to go find a worker and ask what the the line was for, he said the VIPS!! I told him that we and about 10 other people have been standing in line for 2Plus hours, the good thing is they rushed all of us up the front of the line. once in we decided to hit the haunted houses first. Once in the tent we became so damn hot!! It was horrid!!! There were tons of people and we didn't even have a chance to be scared. The only scary part of the whole thing was the blacked out room that lead us to the haunted houses. It was so hot inside the tents and made it hard to enjoy anything or be scared because you just wanted to get the hell out, before we died of heat stroke!  I really looking forward to this haunt and I was very let down:( I wouldn't pay to go again.",1
Arts & Entertainment,"Goodness gracious. Put your big pants on. Parking costs $5. Er-ma-gawd. (Apparently that was an issue with other reviewers.) Carpool if it helps.

Ready now?
Prepared?

I had the delight of giggling like a kid tonight. We came in a large group and I was up front for a section. (The people including spoilers in their reviews clearly dropped their ice cream.) 

While coming as a large group is fun, it's even better to be broken into smaller groups. This way the mystery of what is around a bend is... A mystery.

I gotta tell you: 
There was screaming.

Sure, everyone has their strengths. (Apparently I'm not afraid of the dark. Who knew?) Put me near someone in costume who looks like a doll? One that follows you like a shadow?

I SCREAM.
No shame there.
(I swear she was eight.)

I've never been a fan of scary movies. I cover my eyes the entire time. This was a different kind of fear. A mixture of the unknown, group dynamics, sound and beer. (They serve that outside!)

Fantastic way to kick off Halloween!

p.s. Photos are *not* allowed. 
(Outside by the bar and stage are ok.)",4
Arts & Entertainment,"i love haunted houses, but this was a overall bust.  the lines were outrageous, the scares were minimal.  numerous times i found myself wishing in was over because it was simply boring.

i will not go back",1
Arts & Entertainment,"We had high hopes for this haunted attraction, but found out early on no real screams coming from inside, only a long line with little shock value.
Great outdoor entertainment and rest room facilities which was a plus.
Paying for parking and no real directions where to go once parked are negatives.
Fast pass only good for entry at the start but not once inside you wait like everyone else. First haunted house basically darkness with no real special effects. The 3d clown house was worth it and well done. The shootout part was disappointing. Good last effect with different rooms you are sent into chosen by the ghoul- not everyone goes the same way.
Probably would rate 4th on our list of haunted attractions this year.",2
Arts & Entertainment,"It was bad. Overpriced and not scary at all. For something with Rob Zonies name on it, I feel duped. Long lines. The makeup wasn't realistic. Half of the actors just stood or sat there and didn't even try to scare. They didn't seem all that enthused to be there. I wish I could get my $50 and 3 hrs of life back. All in all I would compare it to a high school theater production.",1
Restaurants,"Finally! A place downtown Montreal that serves decent Hong Kong cafe style food. 

I had a great ying-yang (half milk tea, half Hong Kong coffee) - best I've had in Montreal - with a side of fried pork chop noodle soup. Tastes exactly like it's supposed to. Egg tarts are also delicious. I can't wait to try the congees and the other HK-style desserts on the menu.

The place is newly renovated, very clean and neat. It also offers free high speed WiFi. The only thing I'd say is that it is a bit more expensive than what you'd get in Toronto, for example, where the cafes there offer a free drink with the meal (not the case here) - but it is definitely still very affordable. I am excited this place has opened in Montreal, and looking forward to going again.",5
Restaurants,"This place is a new restaurant Hong Kong style,but the food is no really good like everybody talking about..we order the curry fish ball.,they just put the curry sauce on the fish ball,the fish ball it taste nothing...and we ask for the desert on the menu.,,they don't have ..,if you don't have any desert,why you put on your menu??",1
Restaurants,"Hey hey ~
At first, I thought it was a normal bbtea store, but when I saw the menu i thought it was another Chinese restaurant that sell the ""stereotype"" Asian dishes. 
Looking deeply through the menu you can find dishes you never heard before and i realized they are specialized in HongKong dishes.
It's really confusing lol. They have really bad marketing exposure. They should promote more of their unique dishes.
We ordered Ma po tofu (friend said it was good, he is an expert in tofu)
I went for the fancy stuff. YingYang milk Coffee, it feels like a HongKong Milktea fuse with coffee. I also ordered Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings).
We were amazed that there was soup inside. :D (normally, cheap restaurant microwave it)
The thing that got my attention was the ""Yoji Nectar"". They didn't have picture of it and I decided to give it a try. It turns out to be a specialty dessert in HongKong.
Like I said, the restaurant should advertise more of their unique dishes.

The place is really nice. Relaxing Lighting. The alligator skin chair... :D haha
The staffs are Mandarin, but they can understand basic English.

It was a pretty good experience haha, but you have to dig in their menu and take the risk to order weird name dishes ;P

Food lover~

Yeye",3
Restaurants,"Large selection of food, some unusual items. The service is a bit spotty, long periods of inattention from staff. The portion sizes are large, however, the flavor in some of the dishes was a bit off (compared to what we're accustomed to for those dishes). Overall, it's not a bad place, but just a bit 'cold'.",3
Restaurants,"I've been here a couple of times and I like this place. 
Yummy food, quick service, lunch/afternoon tea at a reasonable price and friendly and attentive waitresses.",4
Restaurants,"My friend and i decided to give this place another try as we didn't like it the first time we came here when it first opened. We went there thinking maybe they improved with time but we were wrong. We ordered baked pork chop in tomato sauce and pork e fu noodles. To our surprise, when the noodles came, it looked like they just tossed left over food on a plate , zero effort, but the saddest part of all this is there were only 2 thin stripes of pork. Baked pork chop was ok. Then the desserts came, we ordered the yoji nectar mango and the coconut milk sago mango. The sago mango one tasted like plastic, we both couldn't eat more than 2 spoons of it, at this point we were hoping maybe the yoji one will taste better. When it finally came, it looked nothing like the picture in the menu. We asked the waiter, as we thought maybe they got us the wrong order. Just so we were told: nup, its the right one we only changed the type of sago and changed the bowl, it tastes the same. AND THE PART THAT MADE ME FURIOUS is she even told us  "" it tastes the same to me, it's kinda food you know "" ....like what? if i wanted * kinda food * i could have ate frozen meal 2 $ from maxi. Service was non-existent, we both ran out of water, n the waitress never came back after serving us the main dishes.",2
Restaurants,"This place is awful, I ordered a dish from the picture they show to customers on menu, and they serve me a totally different one.  Don't recommend anyone to come.",1
Restaurants,"Good food. My meal was made to order
Good location on st catherine street
Friendly service
Great price

Will be going back!",4
Restaurants,"The food we took looked nothing like in the picture, it was soggy and tasteless. If the owners read this I hope they understand that one of the things customers hate most is false advertising. Reduce your menu and keep only the good stuff.",1
Restaurants,first time we came to this place was in mid-February 2015. We were surprised to have discovered a HK style restaurant somewhere else than in chinatown. But it turned that food was so so. we were disappointed with certain dishes.,3
Restaurants,"Visiting Montreal for the first time I saw this place with a huge line of college students outside. I made a note to come back in a few hours for dinner, but little did I know it would be one of the best choices I could make. ""Riz frit avec poulet et sauce tomate au four"" was one of the best dishes I've ever had in my entire life, seriously in my top 5 meals of all time. I've constantly found myself craving for it again in the following months after leaving. Sadly no where else seems to have this dish in America, so I find myself up in the middle of the night staring at pictures of this wonderful dish knowing that if I ever go back, I'm definitely eating here first.",5
Restaurants,"Ordered delivery for 2 people and it took over 1.5 hour to arrive. Called the restaurant when we did not receive it after 45 minutes and the restaurant said the delivery guy left 20 minutes ago. Mind you we live 5 MINUTES BY WALK from the restaurant. Got a call at about 1 hr after we ordered delivery by a delivery guy asking for our building number again, saying that the previous guy got an accident and was stopped by the police therefore couldn't make it. He said he was going to be there in 2 minutes. No one showed up so we decided to called the restaurant to cancel the order. We called 3 times and NO ONE picked up the phone. We're talking about 8pm at night. The restaurant is definitely still open. We finally got our food more than 30 minutes after and the guy had no idea we waited that long. The food was cold already.

Also, once we ordered a combo that was available in the restaurant for takeout and the owner told us for some reason soup is not included for the takeout but he still charged us the same price as in the restaurant.

Will never order from there again. It's a shame since their food is not nearly as bad as their service.",1
Restaurants,"we came here at around 9 pm. There are a few people.Only one waitress to do everything.No one serviced us,so we came and sat by ourself. We waited like 5mins,finally the girl came to bring the menu without smile. We ordered 2 regular meals.one was fried noodles,and the other one was honey beef with rice.The noodles tasted ok,but a little salty and nothing special.The second one had too much sauce.it looks like gigantic ocean and the beef was too sweet and not fresh. The rice dry like grandma' face. I feel like the food in the restaurant taste not like traditional Chinese food. I still recommended you to go there and have a try, because you could prove me right.There are many other restaurants in downtown Montreal and you have  other better choices. Coz the price is not cheap.",2
Restaurants,"Was looking for an HK cafe because I missed home, but food was meh. Got the french toast, and grass jelly milk ice. Both staples of HK afternnon tea, but the toast was way greasy with the inside undercooked and the drink way too sweet. Ended up being the only one in the restaurant (it was 3...which is optimal afternoon tea time?) Probably will come back though...due to proximity and nostalgia.",3
Restaurants,"Greasy floor is really terrible from my way of understanding ""sanitization"". There is nothing spectacular of their HK style cuisine. It is what it is.",1
Restaurants,"Ordered food for 2 people and were told it would take about twenty minutes to be delivered. Delivery guy showed up 1+ hours after not taking responsibility. Food is ok, nothing too crazy but decent for the price.",2

Arts & Entertainment,"Snow.  Freakin' snow in Downtown?!  Well, I'm not sure if they make it with a giant snow machine or if they hired all the mobile snow cone trucks to make it?  Some how Zappos brought ""snow"" slides and ice skating to Las Vegas.  Directly across from the Container park.  The lot that is dubbed ""Winter Wonderland"" boasts X-mas trees for sale, food trucks, inflatable lounge seating around heater poles and a huge wall of bright lights.  Lets not forget the humongous lit up X-mas tree in the center of it all.  The desert kids get to have a taste of what it's like to have a white Christmas.

You may enter free but sliding down the big tall snow sledding slope is $10 for 5 slides.  Not a bad fee at all!  Snow play is $5, whatever that is?  My 3 year old was so exited to go down the slide with me.  I am not a little dude so we probably went down way faster and farther than anyone else this year, lol.  One thing my boy learned is that snow is cold!  Freezing cold.  Good thing they had those heater lounges set up.  The kids love love loved running around Winter Wonderland and I would like to recommend this Holiday newcomer to all parents and couples.  

Be smart with your visiting as I don't think they have a set time for operating hours.  It's probably play by ear, but if you go on weekends it should be open until 10pm.  Minus a star for not having regular hours and another star for having horribly under funded marketing.  People should know this place is here, it's an awesome winter attraction!  Pack up the brats & go!",3
Arts & Entertainment,Real snow sledding next to Container Park. Very cool! The ice skating...not so much. Plastic ice might be safer...but way way less fun. Overall cool place for your kids to kill a couple of hours. Prices are reasonale. 10 bucks for 5 sled rides down the hill...5 bucks to skate ( unlimited).,3
Arts & Entertainment,"Loved it! We had such a fun time here! $25 special included 5 times down the hill on the sled, snow play for 4 people, and unlimited skating for 4. They also had a cute movie with a lightshow and tons of awesome inflatable furniture and bean bags. Gorgeous lights and a huge tree complete with a really sweet Santa! ($10 for pics). Staff was super friendly and it was well organized. Great price for a few hours of fun!",5
Arts & Entertainment,"You get what you pay for (which is nothing because it's free entrance).

KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU GO HERE! 

Now if you're thinking it'll be anything close to what the Magical Forest is, please don't.

This Winter Wonderland place is next to Container Parker. The entrance is kind of off to the side so be on the look out. When you enter, you're greeted by a Merry Christmas written out on the wooden panels. On the left, there's a wall of nights with a huge screen that features ""showings"". If you head straight, you'll see the huge Christmas tree! There's a Tunnel of Love with mistletoe hanging on both ends. The fun stuff you have to pay to do which is play/slide in the snow and ice skate. They serve hot chocolate as well, but I heard its a bit overpriced.

All in all, it's free and it's new. I probably won't make the trip from the Southwest area again just to see this places BUT if I'm ever in the DT area and want to take more pictures, I might stop by.",3
Arts & Entertainment,Went here last night and it was dead. Maybe it's because Christmas is over (???) But the kids had more expectations from the pictures they saw on Yelp. So just a heads up if you're planning on going here don't expect too much :),3
Arts & Entertainment,Now my wife loves Christmas so we just had to go check this out. Its a cute little set up but definitely for young kids. They serve hot chocolate to keep you warm. The one cool thing was the small hill where you can go sledding on snow! They have a skating rink that resembles ice skating. There was a small light display but the little kids really seamed to love it. There was also a large outdoor screen where they showed some short animated holiday videos,4
Local Flavor,"It's a must see! 88,000 lights! On a home! That's right ala Clark Grizwold style!  Coined ""The House On Robindale"" where resident and Las Vegas strip performer Marc Savard resides.  Both Marc and his wife were outside in front of their home greeting all of us.  His little ones were passing out candy canes or dancing along with the music synchronized to the spectacular Christmas light show.
 
My friends Sam R & Vicki E shared the House On Robindale Facebook page couple weeks ago.[ https://www.facebook.com/houseonrobindale ]I've been following the progress on the ""House on Robindale""
. 
Marc told me that 12-15 hours were spent programming EACH song.  And the back story I read on this years display was 1 week before the start of the Christmas light show, Marc discovered all the programming for his light show was stolen. How disheartening. All that hard work gone. Amazing that he got it put out on time! There was 24 songs listed on the playlist.
 
It's pretty cool how the lights fit the theme of the music. Like in ""Let it Go"" from Frozen, the light show colors twinkle blue! It's just brilliant how each song is different set of light patterns and colors.
 
How did they manage to put lights on the palm trees?  A crane of course.
 
How do you get here. Easy. From Eastern turn onto Robindale heading west(towards LVBLVD) After you past Spencer, you'll see the home on your right side. Parking available in front of home. If you wish to stay in your car tune onto 101.3 to hear a broadcast of the music  synchronized to the lights! How cool is that!
Their neighbor which is a church has a little set up where you can get some hot chocolate too.

Is it worth coming out here to see? Of course it is!  It's FREE - Family friendly - open 5-10pm daily

This family put in so much time, money (their NV Energy bills) and effort to share their home with the public. Seeing their little girls smiling faces, skipping around and dancing was just priceless.You can catch the many Youtube vids but it's not the same coming to see it live.
  
It's their fourth year putting up this light show, but our first time to see it. We definitely are adding this place to the top our our holiday tradition of Christmas light displays. The Christmas spirit is here for sure!",5
Local Flavor,"A must see for families!!  My kids loved it!!  Amazing job this owner has done. The lights completely and constantly change and are sync to the music. to the homeowner , he was outside handing out candy canes",5
Local Flavor,"I've never had so much fun looking at Christmas lights! 

It was a nice night out, so we got out of the car and stood in front of the gate. However, if you don't want to get out of your car, you can tune into 101.3 to hear the music. There's plenty of street parking, and there's also a lot just around the corner from the house if it's a crowded night.  

I've been to a light display like this before, but the thing that stands out about this place is the variety of music. I like that it's not just Christmas music, but also current popular songs. We were dancing on the sidewalk all night! My favorite was Fireball by Pitbull. Every time the song went to the chorus and said fireball, the lights changed to all different colors! So much fun! This will definitely be something that I do every year!",5
Local Flavor,"Christmas spirit is alive and well!

This house is simply amazing.  The time and effort stringing up lights is more than I could ever do.  Then add in the coordination to various Christmas tunes is awesome.  The cherry on top is their own frequency to tune your car radio is phenomenal! 

During the few songs I enjoyed, many people were coming and going.  I was so happy to see people gathering with loved ones to enjoy this light and song show.  

Bravo to this family for making this a tradition.  I'm excited to return next year to be amazed once again!",5
Local Flavor,"Absolutely THE BEST HOLIDAY LIGHTS IN LAS VEGAS!!! The homeowner covers his house, trees and plants in over 95,000 lights. Its all synchronized to music! You can listen and watch from your car because he broadcasts the music on the radio. I think these lights beat any on The Strip and this is a private residence! A must see every Christmas!",5
Local Flavor,"So impressed by the amazing Christmas spirit and so proud to say this is right in my neighborhood! Marc Savard's is a strip entertainer and every Christmas for the last few years spends hours upon hours slaving putting up thousands of lights and syncing it to fun music. Besides the traditional holiday music, he also throws in other fun songs too to keep everyone on their toes. It is fun to grab some hot cocoa and find a spot to park and watch the show. Not sure how many songs he has now but it has to be over 20. In front of the house there is also a sign telling you which radio frequency to tune in so you can rock out full blast in the comfort of your own car. This year I took my friend visiting from San Francisco. She face timed her 3 year old so he could see and I could here the delight as he was screaming ""Woooooowwww!"" I will probably go by at least two or three more times this season too. Thank you Marc Savard!",5
Local Flavor,Thank you so much Mr. Savard for putting this show together for everyone to enjoy every year. We come at least once a week with our son. I love the fact that when you go stand on the side walk in front of the house others that are there are so nice and enjoying the Christmas spirit & my son loves interacting with other kids watching.,5
Local Flavor,"The BEST holiday light show in Vegas! Dont waste your money on the speedway or time at one of the hotels, GO HERE! It was the most beautiful display I have ever seen. If it wasnt so cold, I could have stayed for hours!",5
Local Flavor,My fiancé and I drove by this house and we were amazed. My fiancé went back a few days later and shot a video of this house. It's truly one of a kind. The owner of the home comes outside and welcomes everyone which I though was pretty amazing! This guy has some serious Christmas spirit that's for sure! I definitely recommend this house to anyone looking for something fun and festive to do!!,5
Local Flavor,"Take time to stop by and check out this piece of Christmas spirit.  The ""House on Robindale"" is decked out in thousands of lights all synced to various Holliday tunes.  Standing there for just a few seconds would be enough to turn even the biggest Grinch, or Scrooge into a gift showering Santa.

Kuddos to you for sharing your Holliday Cheer with anyone  who is willing to take a few minutes out of their day to gaze upon your gift of lights.

Will be back again when it's time for the sleigh bells to ring my Christmas ears.",5
Local Flavor,The lights on this house are so well done.  We loved it and stayed for at least 30 minutes.  The music and lights were synchronized really well and we all had a wonderful time watching the lights turn different colors in tune with the music.  Definitely worth the drive over.  Go check it out.  :),5
Local Flavor,"My final review of 2015 is not going to be about a landmark, a popular restaurant, or hip spot; it is on a local house that has brought the Christmas and Holidays spirit to the Las Vegas metropolitan area. It is a review on the House On Robindale. 

    Throughout the Christmas and Holidays season, I hear so much about Black Friday, the latest fashions, and movies. They don't impress me much. What impresses me is when individuals and businesses invest hours of their time and creativity creating magnificent winter wonderlands that give a spiritual and not material joy. Marc Savard's House on Robindale is an irreplaceable Christmas present that brought joy to many people throughout the Las Vegas valley. It is a joy that cannot be purchased on Black Friday. 

   It was the Christmas season of last year that I first heard about the House On Robindale when I saw Shirley. B's public check-in. I knew that I'd soon be seeing this majestic house in person at the speed of an automobile. I live near the easternmost point of Robindale, and use it to bypass the traffic on Warm Springs and Windmill. During the last two Christmas seasons, I would catch the twinkling lights of the House On Robindale driving by on Robindale Road. I'd usually see a line of automobiles parked in front. From the drive-by perspective, it was roadside architecture. In the physical world I'd pass by it, when in the spiritual world the twinkling lights of the House On Robindale flashed in my soul. In my subconscious mind, it created a fascination with Christmas landscapes all over Las Vegas from the hotel lobbies along the Las Vegas Strip to the preserved homes in the Clark County Museum. 

   As 2015 was coming to it's conclusion, it was time for me to slow down on Robindale Road. On the last two days of 2015, I would stop at the House on Robindale. 

   Yesterday, I stopped across the street. The twinkling lights changed from a spectrum of colors on the rainbow. If I tuned into the 101 radio station, I'd witness them twinkle in synch to the soundtrack of Christmas and pop tunes. I caught the beauty of the show. I read that there are around 95,000 twinkling lights. That is amazing! Mark Savard put a tremendous amount of time into a palette of twinkling lights on a canopy made up of a tapestry of palm trees, railings, bushes, the house, and home. After, I restarted my car, I knew in my heart that I was cheating myself out of a joyful time by passing over seeing the House On Robindale up close. 

   Back in my home where the only twinkling light is my smartphone's notification light, I visited the World Wide Web to research the House On Robindale. One of the tips I became cognizant of was that you can park at the adjacent Church parking lot. From reading the House On Robindale's Facebook page, I was under the impression that they encouraged people to park there. So, on New Year's Eve a few miles away from the hyper crowded celebrations on the Las Vegas Strip, I returned to the twinkling lights at the House on Robindale. I parked at the church parking lot before walking a few feet to the front of the House. I shared the company of a family also enjoying the show. I also appreciated that Marc Savard forsaked his privacy to share his work with the community. We were standing at the edge of his driveway taking in the soundtrack of Christmas playing with the twinkling lights. It was just amazing, family friendly, and joyful. This was a joyful conclusion to 2015.

Happy New Year's and a Happy 2016!",5
Local Flavor,"I had read about this place and heard about it for a long time.  Somehow I just drove by and ""Wow,"" pretty cool.

The time, effort and resources to do this are huge.  Kudos to them.  It looks great and puts a smile on everyone's face that drives by.

Can't wait to take my family by the house next Season.

HAPPY NEW YEAR.",5
Local Flavor,"We visited this house for the first time in December of last year.  My boys were in awe!  The owners do an amazing job syncing the music to the lights, which I am sure takes weeks.  This will definitely be on our ""must do"" list every year at Christmas time.",5
Arts & Entertainment,"Customer care is worse, they don't respond well when you try to contact for the service you bought.",1
Arts & Entertainment,The service is really good and the website is easy to maneuver around. They have great customer service. The content is great and new content is constantly being added. OWNZONES is expanding very quickly.,5
Arts & Entertainment,"Excellent streaming quality of a HUGE variety of content. They seem to be adding more and more content often. The new restructuring of the site is fresh and easy to navigate. My personal favorite right now is the DOX channel, which is a one stop shop for some of the finest documentaries I've ever seen, keeping me entertained for hours.",5
Restaurants,"This place seemed like a fairly new restaurant.  Located conveniently on Southbridge near a popular area.  The chicken was flavorful both the peri peri shredded chicken and the chicken wings.  If wanted, they also provide extra sauce that you can serve yourself.  It's self serve so you must order at the till when ready.  

I would recommend this place, so why not give it a try?",4
Restaurants,"Zuhus is a halal establishment which serves mainly chicken dishes.  A lot of yelp reviews usually never reveal if an establishment is halal or not.  I think it is important for us to include in the review if the establishment is halal as we also have a lot of Muslim Yelpers and friends who would love to know that and we can help them in selecting restaurant.

Zuhus has a menu very much like Nando's.  Or shall I say 'exactly' like Nando's.  It's basically mainly peri peri based chicken, burgers and wraps.  I came here twice but only had the peri peri chicken.  The guy who served me was very accommodating.  I ordered half a chicken but with 2 quarter chicken legs and he gave it to me.  

The taste of he chicken was up to scratch and the meat itself was juicy and tender.  The size of the chicken I believe is slightly bigger than what Nando's is serving, which is of course a value for money.  

They have won my points on all aspects on value, taste and portion.  However, they have lost my point on creativity and originality.  This place is an exact replica of Nando's.  From the menu, sauce and the bottle for the sauce (tall rectangular bottle).  Why can't they come up with something more original?  I would still recommend people to come here and definitely be back again myself.",4
Restaurants,"I would like to suggest you this restaurant. The foods here are the same as Nandos but more delicious. The size of each food is also bigger than Nandos. I had a 1/2 chicken with sweet potatoes as side dish and can't finish all. Next time if you are in Edinburgh, come to try this restaurant. You won't regret.",5
Local Flavor,"This was a super sweet event! Thanks to everyone at Dean of Shadyside and Rachel and Kerri! I felt like royalty as soon as I walked in the door! Everyone was so helpful and friendly. I'm glad that this was a smaller event and that everyone received personal attention from their stylist. I love the color and shine on my hair from the shiny sealer. Krista, my stylist, even took the time to explain each step and product that she was applying and even added curls to my new look. This was a much needed event after a long week and I am so thankful to everyone involved in putting this event together.",5
Local Flavor,This was an awesome event! I loved how my hair came out and everyone was super friendly and excited to have us there. What more could you ask for? I really want to thank everyone for getting this together. I have always seen Dean on the corner but I've never actually gone in. I am so glad that we actually got to see it and get some glam on. Thanks again!,5
Local Flavor,"This event was Pretty Pretty Princess come to life and I could not have been more thrilled to be a part of such an exciting night!

From start to finish, we were treated like royalty. From walking in the door and receiving boas and our ""before pics,"" to being treated to wine and cheese, to getting the chance to receive salon treatments in addition to our blow outs - this event had it all!

Kicking off the salon treatments, I was chosen to receive highlights (and I never win anything!). My stylist Kira, aka Scarlett Johansson, helped me pick out the best natural color for my hair while giving me the deets on their Italian color system. The staff was so friendly and attentive during the entire process, making the event super fun.

HUGE thanks to Dean of Shadyside, especially my stylist Kira, and the amazing Rachel and Kerri for making this awesome event come to life!",5
Local Flavor,"Great event last Friday evening and just in time to get glam for the weekend!  The hair stylists and Richard could not have been more friendly and welcoming. When we arrived we were greeted with a red boa and a before shot was taken.  To help us relax wine and cheese were served and we were able to put raffle tickets in for some awesome services from a cut to highlights. Richard talked me in to getting a glaze and I was set up with stylist Lauren. She was awesome and went over everything with me and explained in detail.  I got the clear glaze which took about 30 minutes to set and loved that you did not have to sit under the dryer.  It was then washed out and she blew my hair straight which is know easy task with extremely curly hair. My hair looked and felt great and still does.  Thanks for an awesome relaxing evening Kerri, Rachel and Dean of Shadyside staff!  Very cool we even got to met Dean himself.",5
Local Flavor,"This event was just awesome! I loved the fact that is was very intimate event and got to meet a few yelpers I hadn't met before. Upon walking in we were greeted with a yelp corkscrew as a door prize, a before pic, and then we entered ourselves on the various services they were offering. Some of them were the glaze, deep conditioning, highlights, and a haircut to name a few. There was also a big prize of various hair care products and a gift card.

Anyway our before pic was taken and then I proceeded to wine it up with some cheese and crackers while meeting some fellow yelpers. We all waited until they pulled our names out of bags for the services that we wanted. I actually won a deep conditioning treatment and a cut. I was super stoked about that. The stylists were super great and very atentive to what we requested. I walked out of there quite happy and with a fancy red boa!!

I want to thank Rachel, Kerry, and the folks at Dean of Shadyside for setting awesome event up. It was quite nice to be able to get all glammed up for the weekend!!",5
Restaurants,"I was a loyal patron of Lili Co at the old location in Le Plateau and I was worried when I heard that they were moving to a bigger space. Well fear not my foodies, for the quality is exactly the same, the kitchen and bar are wide open and the food is still soooo good. The feeling of care and thought into every ingredient is still there and the cocktails are incredible (more room = more boozy options!) Best thing about this move? They now do lunch! The menu is always changing, but come for the brunch or dinner and arrive with a group so that you can try a bite of everything! The fish was cooked perfectly, the fiddleheads were divine and my partner's meat dish was fall off the bone, melt in your mouth good.",5
Restaurants,"The service was the absolute worst. The waitress who served us was incredibly rude and ignorant. One of our dishes was half an hour late so when we let her know she told us she'd go check but we didn't receive so much as an apology. She returned back to the bar only to continue flirting with her boyfriend. After another half hour of not getting our food we decided to leave yet she told us as we were leaving that our food was finally ready. We took the food to go. There were no apologies, no reduced pricing, no",1
Restaurants,"I read some great reviews of this place, so decided to make a booking for our 26th wedding anniversary. Sent an email to the email address on the website, and then phoned to make sure when I got no response to the email. When we showed up we were told there was no reservation in my name, that there were no tables, but that we were welcome to sit at the bar. I refused the offer, and suggested politely that it was their mistake and that we should not be made to have a sub-optimal experience because of it. What could have turned into a nasty confrontation was quickly defused when, after a brief consultation, the waitress and chef decided to offer us a large table that would normally seat 5. They then brought us champagne so that we could toast our anniversary. Everything was great from then on: fantastic, creative food, with an emphasis on exquisitely prepared offal. We had 6 small plates between us, which ran the spectrum from sheep's testicles to wild mushrooms. The pièce de résistance though was an apple tart covered in melted aged cheddar and a foe gras. Totally indulgent, but ridiculously delicious. We left very happy. Will definitely be back.",4
Restaurants,"My wife and I had brunch today. Food was superb, service was near awful. We sipped our caesars but our food never came. Finally our waitress came over and asked us again for our order as she said there was a computer glitch. From what we determined there was no glitch but our order never got placed. We waited a long time for our meals while similar orders were delivered to other diners. When we asked why, the waitress apologized and said our caesars were complimentary. Great, but I would have preferred paying for our drinks and getting our meals in a reasonable time. I got the sense she wasn't well trained. I know it's tough to get good service staff but it's also critical to the success of any restaurant. There obviously is great talent in the kitchen but they need it on the floor also.",3
Restaurants,"I love this resto.  It is a real Montreal gem, creative cooking, casual, servers who care and I will be back!",5
Restaurants,"There are so many restaurants in Montreal that I wish to check out but sadly I don't have enough time (or frankly money if we are being truthful). For the part 3 years, the October-November event of MTL à Table has allowed me to get to certain restaurants at a reduced price which I am very thankfully for. When I first looked at the restaurants participating this year, the one that leaped off the page for me was Lili Co. Originally a small Plateau restaurant, partners Catherine Draws and David Pellizzari moved into a bigger space on Saint-Laurent earlier this year. Reading the big reviews they have gotten over the past few years - including a most recent one in the Gazette in July - Lili Co.'s use of offal and off-cuts really intrigued me and had me pinning for a visit. Sadly, the MTL à Table menu didn't have any of that - unless you paid a little extra - but I still wanted to go and give them a try.

Visually, Lili Co. is a nice clean space. The main focus is on the two wrap-around bars which circle both the bar area and the open kitchen where you can watch Chef David and his crew do their work. In fact, outside of a few spots - including where we were sadly! - the entire room is set up to face the kitchen. Service was quick and efficient. Noise level was pretty loud given the room was full. As such, there was background music throughout the night but I honestly couldn't tell you what it was. It is not the most fancy room around but sharp nevertheless.

I felt like a cocktail this evening so I tried one of their seasonal specialities - The ""Sans nom d'automne"" - zubrowska, cachaca, natural apple juice, teapot bitters and star anise. I like this one in theory but the flavour left me indifferent. The sweetness of the cachaca and the apple juice were not noticeable. I was left primarily with the bitterness and the zubrowska - not really I had hoped for.

With the cocktail consumed, we moved on the food. First up was the pork belly served with cashew butter and creamy coleslaw. A generous peace of fatty pork with a nice crispiness to the skin. The creamy coleslaw paired well with the meat. The cashew butter was nice as well.

Our other starter was wild mushrooms poached in butter served with caramelized cauliflower purée and black bread crumbs. A simple dish but so well executed and delicious. The mushrooms were soften slightly with their wonderful earthiness intact. The real star though was the cauliflower puree - so rich and smooth. Very enjoyable.

Our second course started with Gnocchi à la fajiole served with romano beans, smoked tomatoes and parmigiana. A nice creamy sauce paired well with the pillowy gnocchi and the beans. Only complaint would be the portion size - definitely would have been nice to have a few extra gnocchi!

The second main was grilled octopus with a hibiscus glaze, chorizo, soy beans, black olive powder and lemon. The hit of the evening for us. The mixture of the glaze and the chorizo gave the tender octopus a hint of both sweetness and spiciness. The soy beans added a little extra sustenance to the plate. Definitely a dish I would order again.

For dessert, we were treated to house doughnuts with lemon mousse and huckleberry jam. The doughnuts were light and fluffy in the inside with a nice crunch on the outside. Add the sugar coating to the jam and the mousse and you have a nice dessert right there. The final dessert was a brioche with a nut beurre monté, sumac and a wild flower glace au miel. Just like the doughnuts, the brioche was nice and fluffy. The special touches of the beurre monté and the glace au miel provided some nice sweetness and richness.

I'll admit I was disappointed that no offal or off-cut dishes were present in the menu option - since that is what attracted me to Lili Co in the first place - but in the end, that is on me for having waiting until MTL à Table to finally visit Lili Co. The food was excellent and the atmosphere enjoyable - you can see why they needed to move into bigger digs this year. This meal simply reinforced that I will need to come back again. Looking forward to visiting chef David and Catherine on a more regular occasion.

Cheers!",4
Restaurants,"Après avoir goûté le brunch, découverte des plats du soir avec Montréal à Table :)
Nous y allons avec enthousiasme et des attentes pour ce repas !

Pour les entrés :
- Flanc de porc, salade de choux, beurre de cajou : une belle découverte d'association de saveurs entre le cajou et le flanc de porc! 
- Champignons sauvages pochés au beurre, purée de chou-fleur caramélisé, chapelure de pain noir : une bonne portion de champignons sauvages, bien assaisonnés. Très bonne purée de choux-fleur caramélisés. Tout bon pour cette entrée.

Cela commence bien, est ce que cela va aussi bien suivre ?!?!

Pour les plats :
- Gnocchi à la fajiole, fèves romano, tomates fumées, parmigiano : mmm rien de vaut de bons vrai gnocchis! La sauce est savoureuse, sur le moment j'aurais préféré en avoir plus, mais la quantité est quand même correcte. 
- Pieuvre grillée laquée à l'hibiscus, chorizo, edamame, poudre d'olives noires, citron : miam miam miam. 2 bons morceaux de pieuvre avec des petits morceaux de chorizo qui vont à merveille tout comme les edamames. Un mélange entre du sucré, salé et épicé. Vraiment super plat avec des saveurs particulières, bravo au chef j'ai adoré :)

Le second service est donc à la hauteur de l'entrée, finissons avec la touche sucrée :
- Beignets maison avec confiture d'airelles : bien pour finir avec des bonnes petites beignes.
- Brioche avec boule de glace au miel et beurre de noix : TRÈS bonne glace! Vraiment! Le contraste de chaleur entre la glace et le beurre fait que le tout se mélange très bien et les saveurs s'en retrouvent multipliées!

Au niveau du service c'était un peu lent au début mais c'était le temps que cela se lance. Après rien à reprocher, beaucoup de réactivité pour l'eau, le pain et la présentation des plats.

Nous n'avons pas été déçu de revenir ici et on a autant aimé que la première fois que l'on était venus pour le brunch.
Que cela soit un brunch ou un autre repas la qualité des plats est au rdv :)
Je vous le conseille sans hésitation",5
Restaurants,"Il y a tellement de meilleurs choix à Montréal! Essayé au souper, qualité des plats très inconstante, certains devraient être éliminés du menu. Joue de boeuf poisseuse, ne goûtant que le gras, portions franchement minimales pour le prix demandé. Sélection de vins éclectique (Ce n'est pas pcq c'est bio que c'est nécessairement bon)",2
Restaurants,"Great restaurant, friendly and knowledgeable staff. Went with two friends to catch up over the holidays, it was one of the few restaurants open. Started with fresh bread and oysters with a fiery and flavourful homemade hot sauce. Shared five plates, with some standouts being grilled octopus, ricotta dumplings and sweetbread buns. We were intrigued by the penis mapotofu but opted against it in the end.. Les beignets for dessert were delicious, slightly outshining a great pain perdu.",5
Restaurants,"We decided to try this place as it was close to where we were staying in Montreal. The decor is very modern and clean. There is not a lot of seating available; the kitchen is open concept and probably takes up half the venue.

The service was top notch, very friendly staff.

All the food was quite good. We ordered all their ""amuse"" items, which were just small bites for sharing; all were refreshing.

The main brunch item that stood out the most was the caramelized bacon pancake (this was a special, they usually only serve the banana bacon pancake). This was to die for, definitely try this if you come here!!",4
Restaurants,"The staff is very friendly and helpful.

The decor is simple and basic. The atmosphere is great.

The wine list looks great and the two we tried were ultimately fantastic. They have an extensive cocktail list too, I tried the lili co and it was great.

It's a tapas-style restaurant with sharing plates and a changing menu, and we were 5 so I found it a little difficult to share when the orders are so tiny. I thought it would be a great idea to be more diners to get a taste in of everything but I would recommend going in a pair or a trio to get all the flavours in. Everything was tasty and had a pretty presentation but for the price, the portions were quite small. We ordered the platter of steak with the Yorkshire pudding and it was good. This is a meat place. They have a lot of offal on their menu so don't come in if you are a vegetarian or queasy about eating brains, tongue, or penis! The ricotta dumplings were awesome. The octopus was also delectable, melt-in-mouth yum - but again, such a tiny portion that we each only got one teeny nibble. We will definitely try to make our way there again- I hear their brunch is crazy good!!!",3
Restaurants,"Caught up with two amazing girl friends here and had such a great time. Everything from the food to the service to the atmosphere was perfect. We split a series of dishes (5 or 6 I think), which were all fantastic. My personal favs included the curried octopus, dumplings, sweet bread buns and oysters (tip ask for the hot sauce with the oysters - amazing!). I would go back in a heart beat! The only downside is it comes at a price, but it is certainly worth it for a nice night out with friends. I can't wait to go back!",5
Restaurants,It's a lovely place! I ordered a banana pancake. It was bigger than I thought! The bacon was well cooked and the sweet-salty mixed taste was quite good.,4
Restaurants,"This is one of my favourite brunch places in town. The banana pancakes were fluffy. The added banana and the thick piece of bacon really elevated the flavour to a whole different level. It was perfect, sweet and salty! 
We also got the Vietnam omelette, it was refreshing in contrast. The bean sprouts were crunchy, the omelette were tender, salmon and cilantro really brought out the freshness of everything in that dish. 
My friend and I shared the two dishes. They were perfect balance to each other and we really enjoyed our meal. 
P.s. They have an extensive selection of wine",5
Restaurants,"We found the food to be of below average quality, but above average price.  Additionally, the wait time was outrageous.  This did not seem to be the fault of idling waitstaff, but of a slow and congested kitchen.  We watched as personal problems amongst the kitchen staff deterred the completion of our meals.  It is quite frustrating to watch as your meal falls apart in pieces, and is served as a sad agglomeration of other peoples problems.  The menu was uninspired.  

Staff was perfectly adequate.  Ambiance was unremarkable.  Would not recommend.",2
Restaurants,"I heard so much about this restaurant, so when I heard they were having a special menu for Montreal en Lumiere, I had to go. They were making a Dim Sum special, at 40$ per person. We could pick up to 4 different plates per person, so we mixed it up and ended up with 8 different meals. I was very disappointed in the food, it was some sort of fusion, mixing some ingredients together that were just odd in general. The staff were not describing it correctly as they were dropping them off, saying it was beef when it was pork, etc. The sticky rice was more of a pudding, not tasting much other than some lemon. The chicken skewer was really undercooked. In general everything seemed thrown together quickly. A harsh price for really average food. I won't be returning there.",1
Restaurants,"We went to Lili Co for the dim sum brunch they offer for Montreal en lumiere. For $40 per pers., you get 4 small dim sum plates per person. We were disappointed.  In short, it was more or less like dishes served in Chinatown but served over mayo to be trendy, and way too expensive.

Some dishes were good (steamed taro dumplings were delicate and tasty), others were bad (shallot crepes were rubbery and hard; steamed buns were too greasy with a sauce that was too sweet and looked commercial); most were average. 

Service was also average. Upon arrival we were told we had to leave in 1:45, even though we had a reservation. Staff was not too knowledgeable about the dishes they were serving. 

Total bill for 2 with 2 coffees: $100 before tip. A small glass of tea is $6. Way too expensive for average food. You can do much better elsewhere.",2
Restaurants,"OUAIS ! des abats (des tripes) au menu d'un brunch !! J'aime ça :)
Donc oui, j'ai mangé un ragoût de tripes à un brunch, en sauce tomate, avec des chips... et même que c'était super bon !!!!
En plus de ça, dehors il faisait froid et ça ventait, dedans il faisait chaud et y'avait une ambiance chaleureuse. On voit les cuisiniers s'affairer, et moi j'aime bien ça voir les gens qui cuisinent pour moi.
Me tarde mon prochain brunch là bas !!!!",4
Restaurants,"We visited this trendy little restaurant on St-Laurent for date night. The decor is warm and seating consists mostly of places around the bar or small tables on the side for groups of 4. They have an every changing market menu and serve up quite a few offal meats you'd have a hard time finding anywhere else. Given our ever unsatisfied curiosity, we opted to try all their weird organ dishes and were not disappointed! From head cheese to veal testicules and blood sausage, all the dishes were prepared to point and tasted like gourmet food you'd have a hard time believing ppl usually throw away.

My disappointment of the night was that I didn't get to try the dessert I wanted as they were sold out and nothing else on the menu looked as enticing. Also the service was a bit slow at the beginning as we had to wait quite a while to get wine service. 

Overall, a great little place that I'd definitely return to for date night or with a small group of friends!",4
Restaurants,"Had an amazing brunch at Lili.Co. The eggs Benedict were amazing! Served on a biscuit with pulled pork and a wonderful hollandaise. I mean does it get any more decadent ?!? 

The entire menu is in French. The wait staff was more than helpful to translate for my mother and I. I would highly recommend you stopping here while visiting Montreal.",4
Restaurants,Went for brunch. Food was really good. You need reservations on Sundays. They were pretty packed on a cold random Sunday which could only mean food must be good. Much bigger than their old location. Open kitchen concept. We sat at the counter. We shared pancakes with bacon and their regular breakfast. Service was good. Food was good.,4
Restaurants,Just wicked brunch. Big plates. Amazing cocktails. Friendly staff. Also menu was really interesting,5
Restaurants,"We came with a group of 10 and this was the best meal of our entire weekend. The service was friendly and accommodating while the food and drinks (one friend proclaimed the fresh squeezed orange juice the best he had ever had) were exceptional.

My friends and I planned a last minute trip and called Shane on the day we arrived.

They came through in the clutch....wouldn't use anyone else or any other company!",5
Local Flavor,"We worked with Shane and Vegas Republik recently for a Bachelor Party and he totally went out of his way to make sure our group was all set up. From the pre-planning to meeting us at the club as we got out of the transportation that he arranged, he was on every detail. I will definitely be calling on Shane and his group for my future Vegas adventures. Vegas Republik is first class all the way.",5

Restaurants,"I don't think I've ever given a place 5 stars but the location, atmosphere and food were perfect for our sunny day trip to Montreal. We were quickly seated as requested outside in the shade. The water was delicious and the staff quite friendly and punctual. I ordered a bacon cheese burger which was accompanied by a delicious salad. The burger itself was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Something many places have trouble doing. It was one of those meals that leaves you satisfied but not full. Definitely worth a return trip",5
Restaurants,Superb setting. Tasty and classy food. Noisy but that's what one expects in such a lively place. Service is quick and efficient. Had the beef tartare which was excellent. Cocktails are also nicely prepared.,4
Restaurants,Family and I passed by here after dinner for some more drinks. We had a couple youngins with us so we couldn't exactly go to a bar. Decided to try Café Du Nouveau Monde and it was pretty great. Lots of drinks on the menu and plenty of beers on tap. I was also able to steal some bites of the crème brûlée which was amazing.,4
Restaurants,"On a recent trip to Montreal with a group of friends, I was searching the web and Yelp for a good place to eat close to my hotel that was not Asian and I happened upon Café du Nouveau Monde.  When I saw that one of their featured cocktails was my favorite Negroni, my decision was made toute suite.

Seeing that the café is in the same building as the Théâtre du Nouveau Monde and that I arrived about 20 minutes before curtain, I was very pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately, albeit at a smallish table for two, but just right for a single diner.

The café was in high gear with theatre-goers, but my server attended to my desire for a Negroni as soon as I had the menu in my hand.  The drink was delivered in no time flat, and my oh my, it was as good as if I had made it myself.  I shared that information with my server while ordering my meal, and was paid a visit by the bartender shortly thereafter for a nice conversation about proper balance and craft cocktails in general.  A very nice and knowledgable lady.  When I ordered a second one, it was just as perfectly made as the first.

My food was exceptionally good from entree (sauteed mushrooms on crostini) to main (grilled pork chop, a special) to dessert (affogato, served properly with grappa and a shot of espresso on the side).

The café pretty much cleared out at curtain time, but it wasn't long before more people showed up to keep the place lively.  And while I did have a main server, others on the friendly and attractive wait staff had no problem checking in on me and I certainly enjoyed practicing my conversational French with them.

I returned twice during my week in Montreal, once for lunch with a couple of friends (warm octopus salad for me, very good) and for another single dinner (sauteed shrimp entree, roasted scallop main and white chocolate cheese cake dessert, all delicious) later the same day.  And yes, more Negronis at dinner, each as good as the very first.

I would have loved to return to Cafe du Nouveau Monde again, but it being my last night in Montreal, it was made memorable by the food, the Negronis, the great bartender and wait staff.

À la prochaine, Cafe du Nouveau Monde!",5
Restaurants,"Wandering the streets of Montreal while on Spring Break with a friend, we stumbled across the restaurant and decided to have dinner here after seeing the menu and other great reviews. 

I had the grilled hanger steak with a bourbon crème brûlée for dessert while she had a duck confit and apple and pear spiced pie with salted caramel and vanilla ice cream for dessert. We both agreed that the quality of the meal was amazing, especially for the price we paid. For my own meal the steak was cooked exactly how I liked it, and the spices went with the steak perfectly. The crème brûlée was also delicious and you could really taste the cream in there.

The service was excellent and the restaurant generally had a warm atmosphere. We were worried about not having seats as it looked rather full and we did not have reservations, but we were instantly seated. The waiters checked up on us several times during the meal and were very friendly, even asking if we were watching the show at the theatre in the same building to see if we were in a rush. The food came very fast and we were served at the same time. No need to worry about speaking in French either as the waiters were all very fluent in English. 

Overall the restaurant was amazing and I would definitely recommend it for everyone taking a trip to Montreal! No complaints.",5
Restaurants,"Parfait pour manger un bon diner sur une terasse au soleil ! 

J'ai mangé en entré de la truite fumé et c'etait divin ! Le tartare de beouf etait très bon aussi. La viande etait un peu trop haché mais le gout etait excellent !

Restaurants,"Das DOM ist schon eine Instutition in Karlsruhe....


 Die Räumlichkeiten haben trotz ihres etwas ""heruntergekommenen"" Zustandes einfach Flair! Der hohe Raum, die Cocktailbar, die Bar selbst und der Wintergarten sind einmalig. Das Dom ist modern aber trotzdem gemütlich. Die eigens fürs DOM designten Stühle sind darüber hinaus wesentlich gemütlicher als sie aussehen.


 Eine Renovierung täte aber trotzdem mal gut- vor allem auch bei den Toiletten.


 Ins DOM gehen Studenten (wenn auch weniger), Intellektuelle, Landeier, Männer, Frauen arbeitende - querbeet. 
Ab und zu sieht man studentische Gruppen der ""O""-Phase dort. 
Leider ist unter der Woche zur Zeit im DOM nicht besonders viel los- sind die ""guten Zeiten"" vorbei?


 Die Preise für Cocktails wie Caipirinha etc. sind durchaus günstig- alle anderen Preise moderat. Es gibt auch gute Weine.


 Ob derzeit vernünftiges Essen im DOM zu bekommen ist, kann ich gar nicht sagen- das wechselt mit den jeweils andwesende Köchen, und die wechseln des öfteren. 
Die Sandwiches für den Hunger zwischendurch sind jedenfalls immer zu empfehlen.


 Das DOM ist eigentlich immer wieder mal einen Besuch Wert, ob im Winter drinnen, in der Übergangszeit im Wintergarten oder im Sommer draußen... nur am Abend vor Weihnachten ist vorsicht geboten: dann bricht jedes Jahr im DOM der Wahnsinn aus, und es ist gnadenlos überfüllt, weil jeder der jemals in Karlsruhe gewohnt, studiert oder gelebt hat meint, er müsste mal wieder ins DOM gehen.",4

It's brand new, so they didn't have the full menu ready, but we had some lovely wine from their bar area and then throughly enjoyed ourselves during the instruction/painting session.  Katherine was the sweetest, most patient person as she taught us how to paint two different options, and everything turned out looking great.  We got some great pics, as the atmosphere is on point and made for perfect backgrounds.  I really liked everything about this place, and will be back.  Highly recommend it!!!",5

Paintings there are only ten dollars each and they some of them look just as artistic as paintings that are much more expensive! The staff there are very friendly and helpful. Xaiver who is an artist himself is the head teacher I think is a sweetheart. A nice place to hang out and create!!!,5
Restaurants,"Ouvert depuis deux semaines seulement, c'est déjà un coup de coeur pour plusieurs résidents du coin.  Et on comprend pourquoi!  
On vous sert ici une bonne nourriture créole, et ce avec un sourire tout caribéen.  Ce sont donc généralement des viandes mijotées, façon ragoût, délicieusement relevées par un mélange d'épices et de condiments qui ne ressemblent à rien d'autre qu'à elles-mêmes, sinon peut-être au paradis (jusqu'à présent, je suis fan de la chèvre, mais le porc est absolument délicieux lui aussi), accompagné d'un riz (je ne sais pas ce qu'il mettent de dedans, mais c'est absolument délicieux!), d'une salade (OK) et d'une tranche de plantain.  Le repas complet vous coûte 12$, une misère compte tenu de la qualité et des saveurs (sans parler du quartier...).

Bien que l'endroit soit assez coquet, il s'agit davantage d'un service de traiteur que d'un véritable restaurant.  Une moitié du petit local sert d'épicerie créole, ne laissant, pour manger, que la place pour une dizaine de personnes.  On vous sert d'ailleurs dans un cabaret de cafétéria, qui jure plutôt avec les jolies tables en bois et le décors immaculé.    Bien que personnellement j'aime bien manger sur place, l'option de prendre pour emporter devient très avantageuse si on est un peu nombreux (3 ou plus).",5
Restaurants,The food here was delicious! The atmosphere was great. They had vegetarian menu options. We're so happy to have this place in the neighborhood.,5
Restaurants,"Cuisine très goûteuse, portions adéquates, voyage des papilles garanti. J'ai essayé le poulet, le porc avec les deux sortes de riz, les accras et tout était très bien réussi. Le service était rapide (ce sont pour la plupart des mijotés). Les prix sont également plus que raisonnable, ce qui est parfois rare pour l'avenue du Mont-Royal. 

Si je n'avais qu'un seul point négatif, ce serait plutôt au niveau des plats de take-out, qui par grande chaleur et avec la condensation des plats se deconstruisent rapidement. 

Gardez en tête qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup de places assises.",5
Restaurants,"If you don't like having smooth, relaxing craps, and pleasure yourself in hot, anus ripping diarrhea, then look no further- Basha on Sherbrooke and University is the place for you!

This lovely little toilet nightmare is placed in the basement suite of an old, semi-abandoned office building, sharing its prime real estate with a shady currency exchange store that opens for only 3 hours a day and a Tim Hortons above it that, for lack of a better word, is as pleasurable in dining as is eating the asshole an obese computer technician named Fred.  The decor in this Basha's is lovely:  it features crumbling drywall, piss yellow cracked paint, and an orange trim that is peppered with cigarette burns and ashes from the staff after working hours.  The floor is also missing a few tiles and it's been mopped with outdated cleaning products from the 50's that smell like ass-juice vinaigrette.  The decor and ambiance of a Middle Eastern building in the midst of a warring conflict is achieved in all 5 senses...truly a design award is necessary for this place.

The food is affordable...some would even argue cheap as hell.  And hell it does seem to exemplify once tasting it.  The hummus is about 5 days old and unrefrigerated, giving it an extra bit of sour mold to for a reduction in taste, while the kebab meats are uncooked, still dripping fresh in its juices when killed when served to you coupled with vegetables from Lobo.  If you're lucky enough, this delicious meal will also include an extra bonus of a piece of fur or bone from the mystery meat you adventurously embark on tasting.  This is truly a wonderful spoof at the poverty some must undergo in the slums of war torn countries and the owners do an excellent job simulating poverty's finest dishes to an elite group of college students.  Truly, this ploy of forcing empathy through taste is a great charitable cause and is noteworthy in decor, ambiance and especially in inducing you to excretion levels so high that your bowels and esophagus will be taken to unseen heights.",1

Afterwards, my gf admitted to seeing a clerk finger-pick-up potatoes off the counter and putting them back in her plate, but she bought the food anyway because she was hungry.

Restaurants,"Both times I ate here the food was super sub-par. I thought how can you go wrong with some hummus, veggies, chicken in a wrap so tried it once more. Lol...
I took the chicken shawarma and after the first bite, everything seemed to fall apart--wrapping skills 2/10. Also, the wrap was dripping from all the juices from the veggies and not in a good way--it was watery and the chicken was also dry.

Not to mention that the place is located underground and has old fashioned diner decor and a grey dank atmosphere.

Should have checked yelp *sighs* before comming here. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND ORDER/GET BOUSTAN.",2
Restaurants,"This branch is located just opposite to McGill, which means less than 5 min from my workplace.  Although I gave it a low rating I guess I will revisit this location because it is so close and reminds me of the spices I am used to from Israel. The service at this place is fast, the place is clean and they have a wifi so why only 2 stars you might ask ?
Like all of the Basha locations I have visited so far the Falafel is extremely dry, a meal is not cheap (10$+-) but comes without a drink, they dont accept credit card only case and above 5$ also debit, But the worst of all when you ask for a take out you get it in a no recyclable plastic foam container.  Yet, the food it self is not bad and they do have nice deals if you buy the meal of the day (only meat based) or a single pita (less than 5$) so as I said there is room for improvement but the location and memories will bring me back for sure.",3
Local Flavor,"First sin of summer!
5 pounds heavier and completely satisfied!

This YEE was great! Ahi tuna tacos, braised pork Flatbread, wood roasted cauliflower, pickled tomatoes, chef specialty  which was a toast dish with lots of veggies, caramel corn profiteroles, peach cobbler... now all the dishes were amazing, and we all were happy when nate was able to get us the hamburger and meatballs added to the menu. I think the extra dishes pushed open any buttons I still had closed.
My favorite was the pickled tomatoes they were served with whipped ricotta and just so creamy with the flavor of the tomatoes.
There were two cocktails served and I was only able to catch the name of one, desert sunset and I enjoyed it very much. There is tequila in it so I was a bit hesitant but pushed on through to finish. There was also a shot with a salt ream. 
Overall, great event! Nate and the staff put together a wonderful menu and a warm welcome",5
Local Flavor,"I've been wanting to try this place forever so I was head over heels when I saw there was a YEE! What better way to check out one of my bookmarks then with a bunch of fellow elites. 

Upon waking into the event I quickly found a seat accompanied by some awesome Yelp swag. The wood roasted cauliflower and pickled tomatoes were already ready for the tasting at my side of the table. I love love loved the pickled tomatoes! The ricotta cheese was honestly dreamy and the toast was perfectly crisp. I also really enjoyed the cauliflower and typically I can't stand cauliflower so they're obviously doing something right. Our next dishes were the ahi tuna tacos, braised pork flatbread and the chef special. Out of these my favorite was the ahi tuna tacos. I would come back here again just for those alone. After that we had the glutton burger and lamb meatballs per Nate's special Yelp magic. To finish we had the caramel corn profiteroles and peach cobbler. So good! 

I love this event and this place in general. Such a fun downtown vibe & they use locally grown ingredients. How much more awesome could you get?!",5
Local Flavor,"A truly Bacchanalian feast at Glutton!  Pub tables, regular tables, and counter seats with a view of the open kitchen had about 25 of us eating and drinking like royalty. 

We were served, in quick succession, cauliflower roasted in a brick oven, with curry almond butter (be still, my heart!), braised pork flatbread, and pickled tomatoes with a creamy whipped ricotta.  I've never liked anything pickled except for pickles on a burger, but these tomatoes were out of this world.  Quickly following were ahi tacos with yuzu guacamole (a new one for me), and a special chef fruit/veggie/cheese? creation on toast.  As if that weren't enough to stuff us, a sampling of a Glutton burger and scrumptious lamb meatballs followed.  

Our thirsts were slaked, first with a delightful, sugar-rimmed aperitif, then with a full-sized Mango Shrub with basil syrup, and finally, a potent peach drink.

But wait, there's more - dessert!  Caramel corn profiteroles, with popcorn ice cream, and a peach cobbler.  Food coma was the rule, not the exception.

Thanks to the chef and the terrific staff at Glutton for fêting and feeding us and, as always, to Nate for another spectacular Yelp event!",5

I'm a sucker for a good theme.  When I saw Nate was putting together a Seven Deadly Sins series of Elite events, I'll readily admit, I got excited.  There were two events that I was super excited about, and hopeful to get into, and Gluttony was one of them.

I'd heard a bit about Glutton before, but not much past the fact that the food was good.  With a name like ""Glutton"", I'd certainly hope so.

I arrived WAAAAY early (read the event time wrong) but got to hang out and chat a bit while Nate and the crew set up.  I had the chance to meet Chef Bradley Manchester, head chef, owner and founder of Glutton, before the rush of people arrived.  

I chose a seat at the bar around the open kitchen, so I could watch the action!  I was not disappointed.  Lots of interaction with Chef Bradley, and sous chef Zach, who was fun to watch work.  This kid knows what he is doing in the kitchen!  

On to the food!
Courses were served in fairly quick succession.  Truly, everything was just delicious.  We sampled:
Ahi Tuna tacos on a wonton shell:  No guac for me (thanks to the staff for catering to my allergy).  Its really hard to pick a favorite out of all of the delicious treats we tried, but this one is right on top.  
Wood Roasted cauliflower with pickled shallots:  Ever since the event at Harvest, I've been eating as much cauliflower as I can get my hands on.  Luckily for me, my dining companion, Jay A, is allergic to curry, so I actually got to have the whole dish of cauliflower to myself!  I killed it. The pickled shallots were awesome.
Whipped ricotta with pickled tomatoes on toast:  As someone who normally can only handle ricotta in small doses, this was AMAZING.  My motto for the evening quickly became ""I am weak, and I love cheese.""  Couldn't get enough of this.  
Chef's specials:  This was crostini with a FAVA BEAN HUMMUS (a revelation.  Simply awesome) topped with more delicious cauliflower and other awesome ingredients that I don't remember.  Wonderful.  Really wonderful.  
Braised pork flatbread:  Yum.  I'm not a pork eater, usually, but this was really nice.  
Cheeseburger:  Even something as simple as a burger was packed full of flavor, and cooked to a perfect medium rare.  This made me ridiculously happy.
Lamb meatballs with a tomato chutney:  REALLY well seasoned lamb.  
Desserts were:  Caramel corn profiteroles with popcorn ice cream:  my favorite.  I've never had a profiterole before, and I'm DEFINITELY a fan now!
Peach cobbler with rum raisin ice cream.  in a word?  YUM.  Also, I need the mini cast irons these were served in.

As far as drinks go, bartender Dean is super passionate about his drinks and what he does.  He started us off with a sugar-rimmed aperitif, I sadly don't remember much about what was in this drink, but it was perfection.  I could sip on this all night long.  Second cocktail was a Desert Sunset:  a mango shrub with tequila and BASIL simple syrup.  Dean, very kindly, shared the secret of making a basil simple syrup, and I cannot wait to try it at home.   The final drink...oh the final drink.  A peach cocktail made with Rye...and ancho chile liqueur. I was astounded.  Again, Dean was nice enough to show me the bottle of the liqueur so that I can find it on my own...and he actually gave me a sample of the liqueur on its own.  (Its spicy and sweet and incredible.  I'll be buying a bottle ASAP.)  

Nate and the Glutton crew knocked this event out of the park.  Glutton also boasts locally sourced food.  Everything is made in house or is locally made.  No frozen bags of food here.  I'm super happy with this event, and am already making plans to go back for brunch with my husband, asap.  

Thank you so much to Nate, Chef Bradley, Chef Zach, Dean, and the rest of the crew for a memorable and delicious evening.  

Gluttony never tasted so great!",5
Local Flavor,"I was a glutton alright...and am so happy to be at Glutton for this first of the seven deadly sins event! It was great seeing old and new Elites.  I had great conversations with Cassandra.

Since I was one of the few that got to Glutton early, I get premium seating at the bar area, where I see the awesome chef staff create our food right in front of us.  There were delicious drinks that accompany our food, but since I am nursing, I just sipped on water.

We got to enjoy the ahi tuna tacos.  These tacos stand out because instead of tortilla shells, we get this nice crispy and light wonton shells, and the yuzu guac is just fantastic.  Then we got the wooden plate of whipped ricotta with fresh pickled tomatoes that have been peeled, served with grilled bread.  Next was the braised pork flatbread.  There is the richness of the fontina cheese, but the picked fennel was a perfect compliment to cut the richness.  The wood roasted cauliflower was a dish that I have not seen at any other place before..has curry almond butter, cumin pickled shallots and mint.  I only got to taste this as eating too much will not be a good thing for my baby, she gets colicky.  I will wait until I am no longer nursing to eat a bowl full of this!  We ended with the caramel corn profiteroles and the peach cobbler, which was served in a mini iron cask, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  They were delicious.  Chef Bradley also introduced a new bite that we got to taste..it was my favorite bite of all.  A piece of toasted bread, with nuts, hummus, raisin, and other ingredients that just excited my palate.  I cannot wait to take my hubby to Glutton and taste this must try explosive bite.

I really enjoyed everything...Chef Bradley creates food that is a bit salty, sweet, sour, just full of umami.

Thank you to Nate and Sarah (nice to meet you!), for setting up this event.  And for our Yelp Eat24 red bag with schwags in there as well.  Nate, as always, such a wonderful CM and host.",5
Local Flavor,"Thank you to the glutton and yelp team for such a fabulous event!  I've been to glutton once and had their burger and a pork belly frisée salad that was so bomb. So of course I was super delighted to come back again for their new seasonal menu. 

This event started right on time which I really appreciate! We started off with ahi tuna poke tacos which were divine. It had fresh tuna guacamole and this sweet sauce that went perfectly all wrapped up in a crunchy taco. It was the favorite think I ate that night. The next course was a braised pork flat bread with onions and a bbq sauce. Again that was really delicious. The meat was juicy and complimented the onions perfectly. We also had a chefs special which was a thick crostini with capers, raisins and roasted cauliflower. Very interesting combo and I enjoyed it. Next was a picked tomato with whipped ricotta served on thick bread. Personally I would have liked more tomatoes because it was so delicious. I think the tomato to cheese ratio was a bit off. 

We also enjoyed the roasted cauliflower and lamb meatballs.  To me they had very similar Indian inspired flavors. A little on the herby sweet side. I don't think the lamb needed the bread on top but presentation wise it was on point. Next came the burger with fries, again a solid but I was so full at this point. We finished everything up with desserts.. Peach cobbler and a profiteroles. I loved the cobbler and the ice cream that came with it. The profiteroles dough was a little hard though..but I don't think I've had a profiteroles before so I'm not sure how it was supposed to be. 

All in all the event was wonderful. Got to connect some new and old friends which is awesome. I don't drink much but the drinks were good in my opinion. A little on the sweet side which I liked. I also liked that I got a chance to meet the chef and interact with him and the bartender a bit.  The waitresses were really nice and sweet too!",5
Local Flavor,"I usually don't venture downtown and Im sure I've been missing out on some quality restaurants consequently. Glutton is certainly one of those said restaurants. It's a cute little place, small size but plenty of personality. An old-school brick feel and a very friendly staff is found here. But of course, we are interested in the food, and the yelp event I attended gave me plenty to sample:

-Ahi Tuna Tacos: unfortunately, this was the best dish of the night by far. I say unfortunately because it was the first thing they served. Fried wanton taco shells and yuzu guacamole made this an amazing start.

-Braised Pork Flatbread: Pretty good, nothing crazy though. Pork, fontina cheese, fennel etc.

-Wood Roasted Cauliflower: Not my favorite, curry almond butter not ideal but also not the flavor profile I prefer but passable.

-Picked Tomatoes: Named a house favorite by one of the waitresses but I got news for ya sista, its bread ricotta and tomatoes. Tastes like it too. Nothing special.

-Burger & Fries: Standard cheeseburger w/ pickles and lettuce. Fries pretty great though.

-Lamb Meatballs: Kinda felt out of left field given that they came with tzatziki and obviously thats very different from the kind of food we had been having but it was good.

-Caramel Corn Profiteroles: salted carmel popcorn ice cream and peanuts. Can definitely taste the popcorn. Pretty good but the lesser of the two desserts.

-Peach Cobbler: Vanilla ice cream, rum raisin butter sauce. Very good. It's a cobbler of course so you know what to expect but executed well.

So, as you can see not everything was a home run but nothing was bad either. Some items were great and others just okay. But the brownie points here is that it's very clear to me that the chefs are into creativity, and even if that doesnt always make the perfect dish they still are willing to try new things and change their menu which is much appreciated. It's a fun place and the bartender seems pretty legit and will make drinks on the fly.

Ive seen some negative reviews in the past which leads me to believe maybe there are inconsistency problems? Like I said not all dishes I tried were created equal so I can imagine that's the case but hard to say since it was my first visit.

That being said, prices seem reasonable even though I did not pay them cuz Im a bamf. But you get the picture this is a fun place with plenty of personality and creativity.

Worth a visit.",5
Local Flavor,"If you ain't early to a YEE, you're late. I arrived at Glutton around 20 minutes early and ended up sitting at the kitchen bar next to OG Regina C. We had the best seats in the house and were able to watch the chefs in action as well as get first dibs on outgoing food items. Lucky us! The YEE at Glutton was fantastic - there was so much food being passed around AND I was happily sipping away on 3 different cocktails. Kudos for Glutton to getting out food so fast and cooking up a storm in the kitchen. Bites were actually being passed around before 5:30, which is super impressive in my book.

WOOD ROASTED CAULIFLOWER: This had a tart vinegar taste to it and was perfect for my vegetarian palette.  
PICKLED TOMATOES: My favorite dish of the night. The ricotta cheese was decadent and the pickled tomatoes were lovely. The dish came with a massive amount of toasted bread so no whipped ricotta went to waste.
CHEF'S SPECIALTY BITES: A small toasted baguette with hummus, raisins, and an assortment of sprinklings. This was inventive and tasty.
CARAMEL CORN PROFITEROLES: Presentation was on point and the shells were super crisp.
PEACH COBBLER: My preferred dessert of the night! 

The Glutton staff were super nice and ensured that out water glasses were filled. Chef Bradley and his staff seem very passionate about what they do. I look forward to visiting Glutton again! Thank to Nate and his assistant Sarah for organizing this event! It was a real treat. :)

YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #50",5
Local Flavor,"YUM!!! YUM!!! GIMME SUM!!! 

Wow! The staff did such a great job with making us elites feel welcomed! Super friendly, attentive, and well knowledgeable about the menu! It was so refreshing to learn about the menu and all of the organic products that they use for the ingredients for all of their food! FRESH ingredients really make the difference in not only the taste but the quality of the food! I wish I could list everything I tried but I will only highlight some of my favorites!

Ahi Tuna Tacos

Lamb Meatballs

Glutton Burger

Peach Cobbler

And of course all of the cocktails that were served! I wish I remembered what the first one we had was called in the shot glass, but whatever it was definitely tasted good however if it would've been chilled that would've been GREAT! The Whiskey Sour had a nice little kick to it and borderline super strong but loved it! All in all I will most definitely be back to get some more great grub!",5
Local Flavor,"The first of The Seven Sins Elite Summer Series was fantastic! 

Arrived a few minutes late and missed out on one dish, the Ahi tacos. All good. The other dishes after that were amazing! 

Started off with a fruity shot, this one was my fave out of all the cocktails I tasted. It was awesome because the mixologist was very creative with concoctions and came to our table to inform us what ingredients he used for each cocktail. 

Other sinful menu items for that night were the Braised Pork Flatbread (DELISH!), Wood Roasted Cauliflower (Flavorful and one of my faves!), Pickled Tomatoes which came with a flavorful and fluffy whipped ricotta, and thick slices of soft, lightly toasted bread. Chef Specialty Bites with cauliflower, raisins & other interesting flavors. The Lamb Meatballs were delicious and flavorful, one of my favorites. The thick & juicy cheeseburger was delish. For dessert, we got Caramel Corn Profiteroles with popcorn ice cream and Peach Cobbler with vanilla ice cream and rum raisin butter sauce. Both were creative and tasty. Most memorable was the Wood Roasted Cauliflower and Lamb Meatballs, I will definitely order those if they decide to add it to the menu! 

The Glutton staff was friendly, attentive, informed us every few minutes when the dishes would be served, and very creative with their new creations. I will definitely come back to try other items on their menu. 

Much MAHALO to the Glutton chef and staff and Nate and staff for putting together an amazing event! Our bellies were stuffed that night!

2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     18/100",5
Local Flavor,"You can never go wrong with this place. The service, the atmosphere and the food are just great. We had the opportunity to taste about 10 different dishes. One of my favorite was the side of broccoli. The chef and owner are just great working with fresh vegetables. The best part is that they try to use organic and fresh items from farms close to Vegas. This event was very fun and had a great selection of dishes! It was definitely a great way to represent one of the seven deadly sins! We were wayyy too full at the end of our meal!",5
Local Flavor,"It was a great event at one of the best downtown restaurants. Out of all the dishes we tried my favorites were the pickled tomatoes and whipped ricotta (that cheese was so silky smooth); the wood roasted cauliflower (amazing flavors with the curry almond butter and cumin shallots); and the peach cobbler (I'm a sucker for sweets and I devoured the cobbler in seconds). I love that Chef Manchester and team change up the menu regularly. That gives me plenty of reasons to return. The service, led by Stacey, was top notch and Dean's cocktails were exceptional, especially the last one with whiskey and orange juice.

Of course no Yelp event would be complete without excellent company. The folks on my end of the table (Andrea, Sheila, Kat, Sarah, and Mindy) were great to hang out with. And, I can't forget about Nate. Thanks for putting together another memorable event!",5
Local Flavor,"A wonderful tasting that demonstrated Chef/Owner Bradley Manchester's culinary passion and the vision of Glutton. One large factor being a menu driven by locally-sourced and seasonal ingredients. The dishes were creative, intriguing, and most importantly, delicious!

Our gluttonous meal:
+ Pickled Tomatoes with whipped ricotta and basil; Grilled bread.
+ Braised Pork Flatbread with fontina, bordelaise, pickled fennel.
+ Curried Cauliflower with almond butter, cumin pickled shallot, mint.
+ Ahi Tuna Tacos with sweet chili, yuzu guacamole, frisee, pickled fresno pepper.
+ Special Toast with fava bean puree and tapenade of cauliflower, raisins, red pepper, capers, and almonds.
+ Lamb Meatballs with tomato chutney, cucumber yogurt, pickled feta toast.
+ Glutton Burger with housemade american cheese, b&b pickles; Fries.
+ Caramel Corn Profiteroles with salted caramel, popcorn ice cream, peanuts.
+ Peach Cobbler with vanilla ice cream, rum raisin butter sauce.

Though everything was good, my favorites were the Pickled Tomatoes with Whipped Ricotta, Ahi Tuna Tacos, Special Toast, and Caramel Corn Profiteroles. The Braised Pork Flatbread and Curried Cauliflower were also notable dishes. I particularly enjoyed the way they approach vegetables. There's a lot of pickling involved, which I love!

We were also treated to three well-crafted cocktails that were perfect for sipping throughout our two-hour experience.

Everyone was so wonderful and service was top-notch. Stellar job to the Yelp LV team, as always!",5
Local Flavor,"Dang I thought my review posted but my lovely phone refused to hit send!

I have always wanted to come down and try this place but Downtown is a bit of a trek for me. I'm glad I stopped by because this place is a hidden gem. And even though it's called 'Glutton', I didn't feel gross/disgusted with myself like I usually do when I over eat large quantities of food.  You can really tell how fresh the ingredients were in the food and was really neat to see their take on different dishes. Plus I love how they offer patio seating where you can bring your dog as well.

I loved how the staff was so attentive and informative about the dishes. I will definitely come back for the ahi tuna tacos, wood roasted cauliflower, pickled tomatoes and the peach cobbler. 

I definitely felt gluttonous at the end and was feeling the pressure of my pant buttons giving way. So a huge thank you to Nate for always putting together such great events and thank you to the staff of Glutton for allowing us to dine there.",5
Local Flavor,"Yet another in the long line of Nathan Tours De Force! What a tremendous night at Glutton. We could not have asked for more or better food and drink! The staff gets a special shout out. I had a great time talking to the chef. All in all there was nothing sinful about this event, it was all good! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!",5
Local Flavor,"I have to say, I didn't get much food (only one item), but the drinks, tunes and fun times were plentiful. This was awesome, so laid back and technically my first Vegas pool party...only took 13 months of living here. 

Great set up with multiple cabanas, waiters and waitresses that did a great job with such a large group. DJs that kept the the energy upbeat and a nice refreshing pool to dip in and get away from the heat.

I've always liked the Downtown Grand and I will definitely be back, need to plan that weekend pool party soon.",5
Local Flavor,"Writing this while still enjoying a delightful buzz from the myriad of plentiful drinks brought our way for hours. What did I like about this event? To begin with, that I'd been waiting in eager anticipation all week for it, working myself to the bone so that I could enjoy a pool in this 100+ heat, and have attractive people bring me sips and snacks, and to play pool volleyball, and just forget about work and world mayhem for awhile. 

Success! Someone even parked my car for me and then delivered it to me after. I had a cool trendy towel that I used to sit on so I didn't burn my butt when taking a break from the pool. I was chilly when I got out! I wanted that to last forever. All the relief of driving all the way up to temperate Mt. Charleston, but with a fraction of the drive time. 

Indeed, this was Sloth to the Max. I scarfed numerous tiny fruit cups with magical sugar toppings. Could not get enough. In that regard, I like the fact that this Sin event overlapped some with gluttony. It's not ENOUGH to just have one sinful enjoyment at a time. One must MIX their sins for maximum impact. 

What was extra unique about this event, aside from it not being yet another beyond excellent dining experience? It was a chill, hanging-out experience. That's a rarity. And what's more, we mingled with the common people! We are Elite, but we are not above our neighbors. We joined with them, met new folks, made new friends, and a good time was had. 

Thanks Nate! Bomb event as always. Thanks fellow Yelpers--good to connect and reconnect with some I haven't seen in many months. Thanks common people for viewing us as equals!",5
Local Flavor,"Sin #2 sloth complete. So lazy, and happy to have a buzz going on!

The event was amazing with endless drinks, and many bites in between all the beverages. The drinks (seedless & spicy, mule it over, bourberry) were all delicious, but I loved the mule it over the most. I enjoyed the private cabanas, and the misty fans. Conversing with many of the other yelpers. The pool was smaller then I had anticipated, but deeper at around 4 feet. The temperature of the water was spot on.

The staff was excellent, and super nice to take additional orders along with the menu options. Another great event in the deadly sins series. Great job nate!",5
Local Flavor,"What an awesome event!!! The 2nd out of 7 we have and I'm lucky enough to be apart of! For starters I really enjoyed that these last two events have been downtown because I NEVER go downtown! I have to get down here more because they have a ton of new cool places! 

This hotel from what I understand use to be the Lady Luck hotel and I actually stayed there before they demolished it and built this brand spankin new one! 

The pool seems like it's a bit of a hike to get to especially if you're trying to get there from valet! But cardio is key right? Or wait who's counting calories or trying to be healthy? Ha! Once I arrived it was so nice that we had shaded cabanas with welcoming sandals (I didn't get a pair) and towels followed by our YELP lanyards! It was HOT but we were constantly refreshed with plenty drinks! My favorite was the ""mule"" reminded me of a Mojito! The other two were different.. Not sure if I'd order them again lol. Food was minimal but then again it was just finger foods! Hate I didn't get pics but the egg salad was the best! There was plenty of frozen fruits and watermelon salads to go around plenty times! 

Although I didn't get entirely in the pool from the little dip I got to do with my feet was enough to say it cooled me down! Pool is nice and designed a bit different than your average but nonetheless good! All in all great event the staff was courteous and attentive!! What else could we ask for! Thanks Nate!",5
Local Flavor,"What a great event tonight! If having the chance to sit in the cabanas with other great Yelpers, then being a Sloth is a good thing!

The swag was great tonight! Flip flops, we can never have enough of them in Vegas. The drink service was over the top tonight and the apps were wonderful! 

Thank you for putting this all together, it was a great evening!

PS. I did not see the tip note email till after the event and this is my second restaurant event so this is still new.... Can we all rectify the tip issue, I had money and saw no bowl etc... and personally I want to fix it. The staff worked very hard!",5

― Ella James, Sloth

Sin #2, and quite possibly my favorite sin, Sloth, made for a great event yesterday!

After an extremely stressful weekend and week, my husband and I needed a nice, laid back, relaxing day.  
We made our way to the Downtown Grand and found our way to the pool.  The first thing I saw, besides the Yelp banners, were TWO STUFFED SLOTHS!  What a cute idea!  Needless today, I took MANY selfies with the little guys.  (I'm going to go buy one this weekend.)
The sloths were guarding our swag:  goody bags filled with Yelpy treats, and some brand new flipflops from The Downtown Grand!  

Drinks started flowing, and they were potent.  The first was the ""Seedless and Spicy"":  a watermelon drink with a spicy rim.  The ""Mule it Over"" was my favorite of the night: a Moscow Mule with basil!  mmmmmmm.  I had a couple of these.  The third...I don't remember what it was, but I know it had bourbon and berries in it.  This was my least favorite of the three:  the other two were SWEET and this one was not...it might have been better for me to start with this one, but oh well. 

The apps were delicious.  I *think* I was able to try one of everything, my favorites being the watermelon feta salad, the egg salad sandwich, and the shrimp fritters.  DELICIOUS.  The frozen fruit salad was good too.  

My darling husband and I enjoyed some socializing, and some pool time.  The pool itself is pretty small, but it never felt crowded.  The general vibe of the day was ""fun fun fun"" as Yelpers and non Yelpers played water volleyball, and just enjoyed drinks poolside.  

The staff were on it:  fast and very friendly.  

The pool has no cover for locals, and on Thursday nights, they have live music.  I absolutely plan to return again soon!

Nate, Tiffany and crew, it was an incredible day.  Thank you guys for everything!",5
Local Flavor,"Fun in the sun for everyone!!
You're telling me I get to lounge in our private cabana, take a dip in the pool whenever I want to AND have drinks and small bites catered to us??? Yessss....count me in!!

My +1 and I arrived at the top pool deck of Downtown Grand. Their pool area is cute and intimate. Yes, the pool itself a bit on the smaller side but this is Downtown Vegas afterall. Don't come expecting it to be Marquee Dayclub or Encore Beach Club. 

I'm lovin the new Yelp Swag!! Especially that upgraded Yelpstick (chapstick). Very cute packaging!!! =) Even gave out flip flops! Great idea! After we got checked in, off we went to our private cabana space. As soon as we were settled in, the drinks and small bites started rolling in. The frozen fruit cups were delicious! Perfect for a hot summer's afternoon, very refreshing! Normally I'm not an egg salad fan but I decided to give that little sandwich a try and wow!!! Pleasantly surprised! Probably my favorite item. Got sips of all three drink specials. My favorite was the berries and bourbon. A bit strong but it wasn't bitter and nothing I couldn't handle. The ""Mule It Over"" was a close second. And I didn't like the spicy drink. 

The two hours went by so quick! We could've stayed longer if we wanted to as Nate was able to secure our area for the rest of the night. I would love to have another Elite Event like this. Besides fitness events, pool/dayclub-esque are just as fun!!

Thank you Nate and all the other Yelpers who put this event together. Also a big thank you to Downtown Grand for hosting us!",5
Local Flavor,"Relaxing by the pool, drink in hand, slammed in the face repeatedly with beach balls, my kinda day! I love a good pool day. Throw in some drinks, friends, good tunes, a cabana compliments of Yelp and you've got a pretty nice party spot. 

I had a friend hanging out poolside and I already had a plus one so I didn't spend much time meeting and mingling with my fellow Elites. This is usually my favorite of part of YEE's. Making new friends and chatting with people I've met at past events is at the top of my priority list. I missed out on that but had a fabulous time with my ass planted on the side of the pool sipping on a Mule it Over. 

Even though I didn't spend time in the Yelp cabanas, I did manage to sample all three cocktails and the mule was the best. I didn't try all of the bites, by choice, not because there wasn't enough. From my vantage point in the water I could see food arriving pretty steadily. I just couldn't be bothered to hop out of the pool to partake. I did try an egg salad slider when I first arrived and it was delicious. 

It was a great day and I really appreciate all the effort from the staff at Citrus. They really made it a comfortable event, even going out of their way to bring my beverage to the pool. Thanks! Big thanks to Nate and Tiffany for hooking us up. It was a blast and I will be returning to Citrus.",5
Local Flavor,"It doesn't get hotter than Vegas in July. Fortunately, I was able to cool down by lounging in the (somewhat) misted cabanas at the Citrus Pool.

From the live DJ to the neo-soul band, this was the perfect summertime soundtrack. The playlist ranged from Jill Scott to Miley Cyrus. 

As a non-drinker, I was very pleased to know that the Seedless & Spicy and Mule It Over drinks could be served without alcohol. The Seedless & Spicy tasted like a watermelon- lemonade fusion and was my favorite! The servers kept the fruity cocktails coming. 

The bites were SO yummy. I started with the Feta Watermelon Salad which was more savory than sweet. Next, I had the Frozen Fruit Salad which consisted of grapes, grapefruit, and an unknown purple fruit...but it was tasty and refreshing. The last appetizer I tried were the egg salad sliders. The bread seemed to be buttery Texas toast and the egg salad was seasons perfectly with a sliver of cucumber. 

Nate and the Yelp Marketing Assistant did an awesome job on the YEE ( as always). Being a ""sloth"" at the Citrus Pool Deck was the best way to beat the Vegas heat.",5
Local Flavor,"The event at the Citrus pool at the Downtown Grand was a great way to introduce people to a fun Las Vegas pool scene that many, who are not guests of the Downtown Grand, may not be aware of.

After checking in, the Yelpers were given a cabana area to relax and unwind. I can say that it I really like what the Grand has done to the cabana area, they are modern and sleek, and very comfortable. There are little coolers in each area that can hold bottled waters and soda's, so that's great for kids who don't want to drink. That doesn't sound right, but I think you know what I mean.

After most of the Yelpers had checked in, and it was mingling time, the server's came out and took some drink orders. I think they saw that it was better just to make larger quantities of random drinks and then pass them around. And this was a great idea because all the drinks were outstanding, the watermelon cocktail was my favorite and was so refreshing on a hot summer day.

There were some bites passed around as well. There were shrimp fritters, a feta/watermelon salad, a frozen fruit cocktail, and some egg salad sandwiches. I really liked the frozen fruit cocktail, there was shredded mint in it, and it was really refreshing.

We also got to check out the pools, there were elevated pools, with sides where you can sit down and just put your bum and legs in, as well as its ease of jumping in and out of the pool, it's really well designed.

Big thanks to the Yelp team, the Downtown Grand team, and for everyone who made this possible. Great event all around!",5
Local Flavor,"The Sloth YEE at the Downtown Grand Citrus Pool Deck was ridiculously fun. Small bites were constantly being passed around along with sporadic waves of slurp worthy cocktails by the awesome staff at Citrus. Yelpers lounged about under the shaded cabana areas and some took the fun to the pool area to cool off. A DJ and a live band provided the music as a backdrop to this awesome pool party.  

Passed Appetizers
MINTED FROZEN CITRUS: Not at all what I was expecting. Looked like a bowl of fruit, tasted like frozen minted and sugared fruit. It was a bit of a shock lol. This was refreshing though and helped me cool off. 
CUCUMBER, TOMATO WATERMELON, AND FETA: A seemingly odd combination but it worked! 
EGG SALAD SANDWICH: Sooo good! I don't even like egg salad but these were magnificent. The crunchiness of the bread paired well with the smooth and texture of the egg salad.  

Cocktails
SEEDLESS AND SPICY: A tequila based cocktail with watermelon pieces and some kind of spicy powder mix coated on the rim of the cup. I'm not a tequila fan but this drink was pretty legit.
BOURBERRY: Bourbon and berries! What a fabulous combination. 

Citrus Pool is definitely a haven for locals in this desert heat. I'm looking forward to coming back! Thanks Nate and Sarah for organizing this awesome event! I had a ton of fun. :)

A nice space with a Dj and a neo-soul event with a live band on thursday nights! I would've stayed longer if the sun wasn't taking my energy and storing it for a rainy day. My favorite cocktail was a spin on a mule the other one was too sour for my liking. Chicken wings were delicious and guacamole is still on my mind. The essence of guac isn't hard, but there's a way to nail it (and they did)! Thick tortilla chips and roasted tomatoes in this table side goodness!!! A must order!!!!! 

I didn't get in the pool, which is probably another reason I was half dead. If definitely like to come back when the sun is almost finished with its one man show and the band starts playing!!!",4
Local Flavor,"What is wrong with hanging out by the pool wit great food great booze and great friends on hot Summer's night in Las Vegas? Not a darn thing! What an incredible event, just what the dr. ordered! In this case the dr. is Nate! The staff at the Downtown Grand were fantastic. I recommend checking out the rooftop pool! As I said it's just what the dr. ordered. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!",5
Local Flavor,"Sin #3 greed- fun until you are caught!!! So don't get caught ;)

I enjoyed the event a great deal because I have wanted to see the mob museum for years, but like all things pushed for a later time. Glad that time came around.

We started at pizza rock, which I was very happy to eat at, and very close by to the mob museum. Started with a glass of house red wine in anticipation of the red sauce pizza I was hoping to devour. Food as follows: classic meatballs, classic Caesar, fried green beans. Parmigiano-reggiano, and the mob boss. I enjoyed items, and the staff was great, and provided to go boxes for all of us. Thanks nate for the grub and drinks!

The event proceeded to the mob museum, and I'm happy after all that food I got to walk it off! The mob museum has its own parking $5 for the first 3 hours. Free to locals. The tour was fun and educational. Melissa the guide was very knowledgeable and cool to let all of us take pictures and be sully. 3 floors of mob/vegas history. From the beginning in 1905 through the times of casinos, show girls, tailored suits, and dinner shows watching judy garland/ liberache. Vegas has changed, but the hustle of getting money goes on.",5
Local Flavor,"With schedule conflicts, out-of-town status, or basic incompatibility (beauty salons for the upcoming ""Vanity"" night) with most of the other events this month, I was very happy that I got in to the 3rd of the ""7 Deadly Sins"" in Sin City, all of which will take place this 7th month of the year.

Thanks first and foremost to the wonderful Yelp Las Vegas Community Manager Nate M., the unofficial sidekick (but official betrothed) Tiffany O., the Marketing guru whose name I forgot, and the photographer whose name I don't think I ever got. Also big props to the Mob Museum, especially our knowledgeable tour guides, and the fine folks at Pizza Rock who really hooked us up after a last minute schedule issue with that initially planned private room at the Mob Museum.

I'll state first and foremost that the one area that could've been improved on was parking. Those in the know ahead of time most likely utilized the free-after-5pm-for-locals Mob Museum parking structure, but at least some of us (including yours truly) settled for street parking at $1 per 30 min. Luckily, I did find a relatively convenient spot nearby and had a short walk to the first act of the evening at Pizza Rock.

Once inside, Nate checked me in and our marketing person (sorry again) wristbanded me for alcohol. Really nice to see that we finally got Yelp logo wristbands instead of the generic stuff of past events. We had a slightly sectioned off semi-private area with two tables and Yelp / Eat24 swag bags at each seat.

Out of the alcohol choices, I decided on the house red wine because the beers didn't seem that appealing (IPA isn't my style and Bud Light is Bud Light), and the house white was the only other choice. The wine ended up pairing well with a lot of the foods tonight, and it didn't have quite the same effect on my memory as the tequila did at the Commissary / Mob Museum event. Thank goodness for that.

We started with three of their appetizers. The Classic Meatballs in marinara were fantastic. I liked them at sister restaurant Little Tony's (at Palace Station), but I really loved them here. Moist and super rich meat was just the right way to start the meal. The Classic Caesar salad was next, and it was perhaps a bit too richly dressed. It definitely had fresh and crispy lettuce though. Finally, the Fried Green Beans, with garlic and EVOO, were a crunchy way to round out the appetizer round.

They also served us three pizzas. The New Yorker, which I'd tried at Little Tony's, was somehow more enjoyable this time around. It's the archetypal thin crust pizza with plenty of meat, mozzarella, ricotta, and tomato sauce. The Cal Italia apparently won something in Food Network, and I could see why if the judges there were as enthralled by the sweet kick of the fig preserve as I was. It was a bit crusty on the edge though, which is fine because the third pizza ended up overflowing with toppings. That one was a Sicilian-style ""The Mob Boss"" and it had seemingly every Italian pizza meat and vegetable imaginable. I didn't enjoy the thicker crust as much because there was hardly any crispy crust, but it was a winner in pure volume and variety.

Food seemed to be allocated for about 4 people per dish, but with some late arrivals or absences, some of us got to indulge in the sin of Greed by eating extra or even taking some food to go. I'm sure that those who didn't are kicking themselves for not being consistent with the theme, if not for having a few more delicious bites to savor tomorrow. This was definitely some of the best food that you can get downtown.

The second part of the event was one block away at the Mob Museum. As I said before, I didn't remember much the first time, and I definitely was in the right frame of mind to soak it in more this time around. That said, I was also greedily trying to play this summer's hit mobile game Pokemon Go while taking the tour. Talk about greed, right?

We were split into two groups of about 10-12 people each, with one tour guide per group. Our tour guide gave us a brief overview as we wound our way through each of the three floors, following the recommended route that took us from the early origins of the Mob all the way to contemporary organized crime stories including El Chapo, FIFA, and (the admittedly fictional) Breaking Bad. I still didn't get a chance to try that police simulator on the first floor, but I'll have a lot more memories this time around. Plus, I was definitely killing it with my Pokemon item-gathering. (Sorry about the off-topic stuff, but I'm sure you or your friends/family would have enjoyed being near two Pokestops for an hour or so too.)

Overall, the ""Greed"" event was definitely a fun and thematic way to spend the evening. Greed is good, and enjoying two great downtown Las Vegas businesses at one Yelp event as about as greedy as it gets.",5
Local Flavor,"Good crowd. Good Food. Great experience!

It was nice meeting a lot of new faces at yesterday's event. I appreciated the table set up space at Pizza Rock which allowed for more intimate conversation. The number of attendees seemed like a good mix also. 

I've heard A LOT about pizza rock but have never had the chance to go. Needless to say, I'll definitely be a patron in the future. The meatballs were my favorite part. The salad and green beans were so good also-- and I am not a vegetable fan. Lots of food and enough to take a box home.

The MOB Museum is my favorite. I went a couple of years ago and was apprehensive about going again but there is so much to read/look at so you don't ever get the same experience twice. I like that they switch out a few features for current events. This part of American history has always intrigued me and I'm a big buff of criminal stories. The tour felt a little rushed but it was enough to entice me to come back again soon. Melissa, our tour guide, was great. I'm the type who asks TONS of questions but she was able to answer them all and didn't seem annoyed (i think haha). 

Thanks again Nate! This was a good one.",5
Local Flavor,"Sad I missed most of the Pizza Rock experience, but the pizza I had at home was de-li-cious, thanks Nate! 

I have been to the Mob Museum before, but I was excited to take a tour with a curator. Even though it was an abbreviated version, it was almost like an ""introductory"" for the next time I go. Ashley, our curator, was so knowledgeable, friendly and funny. It was great to learn some back-stories and additional information to the exhibits.

I firmly believe it might take 3-5 visits here to truly see everything and enjoy it. Although it was my second time, I am still excited to go back and see more next time. Taking my husband there before the end of the year!",5
Local Flavor,"I loved this event! 

Pizza Rock was amazing. This was a first for me and I weighed myself this morning and came home 3 lbs heavier! The private area that we had made us mobster like! Mangia Bene!

The Mob Museum is amazing, we really have a treasure here in Vegas and it takes many visits to see it all. 

Having a small intimate group changes the dynamic of an Elite event by giving us the opportunity to really talk to each other. I met some great fellow Elites and I think we all had a great time as we did what we do best, Eat, Eat, and Experience!

PS Happy Birthday Nate! Mille Grazie again for for being a great host, and also to Sarah for her help as well, and of course your fiancée too for sharing you with us",5
Local Flavor,"Small in comparison. Low key too. This was kind of a nice event in that sense. It wasn't a whole lot of maddness. Just a kickass pizza party with lots of Yelp swag (a mix of new, less new and revamped shtuff) followed by a guided tour of the Mob Museum. That is what the event was plain and simple.

We started at Pizza Rock which was not quite a last minute change up from the original plan but it was changed with some short notice. No matter though. We all seemed to show up and Pizza Rock was more than accommodating. They brought us a feast fit for a mob boss. Meatballs, fried green beans, Ceasar salad, three. Kinds of pizza and of course beer/wine. I would be lying if I said I took it easy and stuck to my diet. Truth be told, I had two meatballs, a serving of salad, a serving of beans and at least one slice of each of the pizzas. I actually had two slices of the pizza with the prosciutto and balsamic glaze. Plus I was playing off of the Greed theme of the night and scavanged all the loose toppings. I way over did it on the food. So worth it.

Around 7:00 we all walked the block or so from Pizza Rock to the Mob Museum and split into two groups to go on a 1 hour guided tour. It was far too short of time for this particular museum. There is just so much information to hear. But with our schedule, an hour is all we could get. My groups guide, Ashley, was amazingly knowledgeable and tailored our tour to our own unique knowledge base and questions posed. It may have been a short tour but she gave us a lot of information centered mostly on the Las Vegas side of mob dealings.

Yes, Greed was a different kind of event. One I had a great time at. I was able to relax and not feel stressed or overwhelmed. Some times low key is the way to go.",5
Local Flavor,"I felt very fortunate that a change of plans allowed us to have some Pizza Rock. I felt even more fortunate and you can say even greedy that we got to experience the Mob Museum on top of that. This was an excellent event with some awesome Yelpers sharing some great food and experience.

Giving us a nice retreat from the usually loud rock themed dining area, the private side room allowed us to have conversations in normal toned voices where I could get the down low on Pokemon Go, very interesting stuff I must say. After our sampling of three Pizzas, I've become even more biased toward Pizza Rock with its twists on classic pies and their unique pies with harmonious flavor combinations. The pizzas came after salad, green beans, and the always delicious meatballs. I was lucky to be able to try three pieces of pizza from pies that I have never tasted before. The New Yorker and Mob Boss were delicious but the combination of salty prosciutto and cheeses, sweet fig preserve, and acidic balsamic on the Cal Italia was my favorite. Thanks to Pizza Rock for being gracious hosts and to Ashley our server who handled our party by herself.

After our hour long feast, we got to walk some of the food off on our trip to the museum. The one-hour guided tour just touched the surface of the museum. Ashley, our well informed and entertaining tour guide, was a wealth of knowledge throwing in informative anecdotes and valuable background stories that you definitely wouldn't get on a self tour. I'll be back for sure to get the full experience. Thanks to the Mob Museum and Ashley for hosting our tour.

As always, thank you goes out to Nate and the rest of the crew for their organization. This is the first of the sin series that I've got to experience, can't wait to what the other sins have to offer.",5
Local Flavor,"This event started out at Pizza Rock at the Downtown Grand. After sitting down, we were given our drink orders and then chatted it up a bit. For some reason, it all boiled down to this 'Pokemon Go' madness. Yes, I admit it, i'm hooked. Anyways, our drinks came out and I enjoyed a Joseph James IPA as well as a red wine which they serve in a smaller vial, which you can pour into a wine glass, giving it some aeration. Appetizers came out first. We were treated to some big meatballs, deep fried green beans, and some Caesar salad. I liked everything, especially the green beans which were fried with garlic slivers. Then, our pizzas arrived. The CRUST, the crust I tell you, it's all about that crust. Crustable, perfectionable. I liked all three of the pizzas offered, especially the balsamic vinegar and prosciutto. The supreme, monster sized pizza at the end was a nice touch. Afterwards, we marched onto the Mob museum.

I've wanted to come to the Mob Museum for a while, it's been on one of my 'to do' lists. I think this place totally exceeded my expectations. While I was just thinking it would be a place with just photos, the Mob Museum is a totally interactive experience. There are tours that offer people to not only look at photographs, but also, video clips, movie scenes, and some famous artifacts such as weapons used by mobsters, and memorabilia from shows such as the Sopranos. There are also fun, interactive exhibits where you can pretend that you are listening to mob taps.

This was a really fun event. If you haven't been to the Mob Museum, I would definitely recommend it, I had a blast! Oh, and you should check out Pizza Rock as well, it lives up to the hype, and then some. Big thanks to the Yelp Crew, the Mob Museum, and a special thanks to Pizza Rock for the last minute hook up!

P.S.: Did you know that Don King killed two people?",5
